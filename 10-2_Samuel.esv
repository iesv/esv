{2Sa 1:1}   After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag.
{2Sa 1:1}   扫罗死后，大卫击杀亚玛力人回来，在洗革拉住了两天。
{2Sa 1:2}   And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage.
{2Sa 1:2}   第三天，有一人从扫罗的营里出来，衣服撕裂，头蒙灰尘，到大卫面前伏地叩拜。
{2Sa 1:3}   David said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel."
{2Sa 1:3}   大卫问他说：“你从那里来？”他说：“我从以色列的营里逃来。”
{2Sa 1:4}   And David said to him, "How did it go? Tell me." And he answered, "The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead."
{2Sa 1:4}   大卫又问他说：“事情怎样？请你告诉我。”他回答说：“百姓从阵上逃跑，也有许多人仆倒死亡；扫罗和他儿子约拿单也死了。”
{2Sa 1:5}   Then David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
{2Sa 1:5}   大卫问报信的少年人说：“你怎么知道扫罗和他儿子约拿单死了呢？”
{2Sa 1:6}   And the young man who told him said, "By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him.
{2Sa 1:6}   报信的少年人说：“我偶然到基利波山，看见扫罗伏在自己枪上，有战车、马兵紧紧地追他。
{2Sa 1:7}   And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, 'Here I am.'
{2Sa 1:7}   他回头看见我，就呼叫我。我说：‘我在这里。’
{2Sa 1:8}   And he said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'
{2Sa 1:8}   他问我说：‘你是什么人？’我说：‘我是亚玛力人。’
{2Sa 1:9}   And he said to me, 'Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.'
{2Sa 1:9}   他说：‘请你来，将我杀死；因为痛苦抓住我，我的生命尚存。’
{2Sa 1:10}  So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord."
{2Sa 1:10}  我准知他仆倒必不能活，就去将他杀死，把他头上的冠冕、臂上的镯子拿到我主这里。”
{2Sa 1:11}  Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him.
{2Sa 1:11}  大卫就撕裂衣服，跟随他的人也是如此，
{2Sa 1:12}  And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
{2Sa 1:12}  而且悲哀哭号，禁食到晚上，是因扫罗和他儿子约拿单，并耶和华的民以色列家的人，倒在刀下。
{2Sa 1:13}  And David said to the young man who told him, "Where do you come from?" And he answered, "I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite."
{2Sa 1:13}  大卫问报信的少年人说：“你是那里的人？”他说：“我是亚玛力客人的儿子。”
{2Sa 1:14}  David said to him, "How is it you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"
{2Sa 1:14}  大卫说：“你伸手杀害耶和华的受膏者，怎么不畏惧呢？”
{2Sa 1:15}  Then David called one of the young men and said, "Go, execute him." And he struck him down so that he died.
{2Sa 1:15}  大卫叫了一个少年人来，说：“你去杀他吧！”
{2Sa 1:16}  And David said to him, "Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the LORD's anointed.'"
{2Sa 1:16}  大卫对他说：“你流人血的罪归到自己的头上，因为你亲口作见证说：‘我杀了耶和华的受膏者。’”少年人就把他杀了。
{2Sa 1:17}  And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son,
{2Sa 1:17}  大卫作哀歌，吊扫罗和他儿子约拿单，
{2Sa 1:18}  and he said it should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar. He said:
{2Sa 1:18}  且吩咐将这歌教导犹大人。这歌名叫“弓歌”，写在雅煞珥书上。
{2Sa 1:19}  "Your glory, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!
{2Sa 1:19}  歌中说：以色列啊，你尊荣者在山上被杀！大英雄何竟死亡！
{2Sa 1:20}  Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
{2Sa 1:20}  不要在迦特报告；不要在亚实基伦街上传扬；免得非利士的女子欢乐；免得未受割礼之人的女子矜夸。
{2Sa 1:21}  "You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor fields of offerings! For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
{2Sa 1:21}  基利波山哪，愿你那里没有雨露！愿你田地无土产可作供物！因为英雄的盾牌在那里被污丢弃；扫罗的盾牌彷佛未曾抹油。
{2Sa 1:22}  "From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
{2Sa 1:22}  约拿单的弓箭非流敌人的血不退缩；扫罗的刀剑非剖勇士的油不收回。
{2Sa 1:23}  "Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! In life and in death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles; they were stronger than lions.
{2Sa 1:23}  扫罗和约拿单活时相悦相爱，死时也不分离他们比鹰更快，比狮子还强。
{2Sa 1:24}  "You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.
{2Sa 1:24}  以色列的女子啊，当为扫罗哭号！他曾使你们穿朱红色的美衣，使你们衣服有黄金的妆饰。
{2Sa 1:25}  "How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! "Jonathan lies slain on your high places.
{2Sa 1:25}  英雄何竟在阵上仆倒！约拿单何竟在山上被杀！
{2Sa 1:26}  I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant have you been to me; your love to me was extraordinary, surpassing the love of women.
{2Sa 1:26}  我兄约拿单哪，我为你悲伤！我甚喜悦你！你向我发的爱情奇妙非常，过于妇女的爱情。
{2Sa 1:27}  "How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"
{2Sa 1:27}  英雄何竟仆倒！战具何竟灭没！
{2Sa 2:1}   After this David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?" And the LORD said to him, "Go up." David said, "To which shall I go up?" And he said, "To Hebron."
{2Sa 2:1}   此后，大卫问耶和华说：“我上犹大的一个城去可以吗？”耶和华说：“可以。”大卫说：“我上那一个城去呢？”耶和华说：“上希伯仑去。”
{2Sa 2:2}   So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
{2Sa 2:2}   于是大卫和他的两个妻，一个是耶斯列人亚希暖，一个是作过迦密人拿八妻的亚比该都上那里去了。
{2Sa 2:3}   And David brought up his men who were with him, everyone with his household, and they lived in the towns of Hebron.
{2Sa 2:3}   大卫也将跟随他的人和他们各人的眷属一同带上去，住在希伯仑的城邑中。
{2Sa 2:4}   And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When they told David, "It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,"
{2Sa 2:4}   犹大人来到希伯仑，在那里膏大卫作犹大家的王。有人告诉大卫说：“葬埋扫罗的是基列雅比人。”
{2Sa 2:5}   David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, "May you be blessed by the LORD, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord and buried him.
{2Sa 2:5}   大卫就差人去见基列雅比人，对他们说：“你们厚待你们的主扫罗，将他葬埋。愿耶和华赐福与你们！
{2Sa 2:6}   Now may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you. And I will do good to you because you have done this thing.
{2Sa 2:6}   你们既行了这事，愿耶和华以慈爱诚实待你们，我也要为此厚待你们。
{2Sa 2:7}   Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant, for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."
{2Sa 2:7}   现在你们的主扫罗死了，犹大家已经膏我作他们的王，所以你们要刚强奋勇。”
{2Sa 2:8}   But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim,
{2Sa 2:8}   扫罗的元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥，曾将扫罗的儿子伊施波设带过河，到玛哈念，
{2Sa 2:9}   and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel.
{2Sa 2:9}   立他作王，治理基列、亚书利、耶斯列、以法莲、便雅悯，和以色列众人。
{2Sa 2:10}  Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
{2Sa 2:10}  扫罗的儿子伊施波设登基的时候年四十岁，作以色列王二年；惟独犹大家归从大卫。
{2Sa 2:11}  And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
{2Sa 2:11}  大卫在希伯仑作犹大家的王，共七年零六个月。
{2Sa 2:12}  Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
{2Sa 2:12}  尼珥的儿子押尼珥和扫罗的儿子伊施波设的仆人从玛哈念出来，往基遍去。
{2Sa 2:13}  And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
{2Sa 2:13}  洗鲁雅的儿子约押和大卫的仆人也出来，在基遍池旁与他们相遇；一班坐在池这边，一班坐在池那边。
{2Sa 2:14}  And Abner said to Joab, "Let the young men arise and compete before us." And Joab said, "Let them arise."
{2Sa 2:14}  押尼珥对约押说：“让少年人起来，在我们面前戏耍吧！”约押说：“可以。”
{2Sa 2:15}  Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
{2Sa 2:15}  就按着定数起来：属扫罗儿子伊施波设的便雅悯人过去十二名，大卫的仆人也过去十二名，
{2Sa 2:16}  And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent's side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is at Gibeon.
{2Sa 2:16}  彼此揪头，用刀刺肋，一同仆倒。所以，那地叫做希利甲哈素林，就在基遍。
{2Sa 2:17}  And the battle was very fierce that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.
{2Sa 2:17}  那日的战事凶猛，押尼珥和以色列人败在大卫的仆人面前。
{2Sa 2:18}  And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle.
{2Sa 2:18}  在那里有洗鲁雅的三个儿子：约押、亚比筛、亚撒黑。亚撒黑脚快如野鹿一般；
{2Sa 2:19}  And Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went, he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
{2Sa 2:19}  亚撒黑追赶押尼珥，直追赶他不偏左右。
{2Sa 2:20}  Then Abner looked behind him and said, "Is it you, Asahel?" And he answered, "It is I."
{2Sa 2:20}  押尼珥回头说：“你是亚撒黑吗？”回答说：“是。”
{2Sa 2:21}  Abner said to him, "Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his spoil." But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
{2Sa 2:21}  押尼珥对他说：“你或转向左转向右，拿住一个少年人，剥去他的战衣。”亚撒黑却不肯转开不追赶他。
{2Sa 2:22}  And Abner said again to Asahel, "Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?"
{2Sa 2:22}  押尼珥又对亚撒黑说：“你转开不追赶我吧！我何必杀你呢？若杀你，有什么脸见你哥哥约押呢？”
{2Sa 2:23}  But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.
{2Sa 2:23}  亚撒黑仍不肯转开。故此，押尼珥就用枪鐏刺入他的肚腹，甚至枪从背后透出，亚撒黑就在那里仆倒而死。众人赶到亚撒黑仆倒而死的地方，就都站住。
{2Sa 2:24}  But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
{2Sa 2:24}  约押和亚比筛追赶押尼珥，日落的时候，到了通基遍旷野的路旁，基亚对面的亚玛山。
{2Sa 2:25}  And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill.
{2Sa 2:25}  便雅悯人聚集，跟随押尼珥站在一个山顶上。
{2Sa 2:26}  Then Abner called to Joab, "Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?"
{2Sa 2:26}  押尼珥呼叫约押说：“刀剑岂可永远杀人吗？你岂不知终久必有苦楚吗？你要等何时才叫百姓回去、不追赶弟兄呢？”
{2Sa 2:27}  And Joab said, "As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning."
{2Sa 2:27}  约押说：“我指着永生的神起誓：你若不说戏耍的那句话，今日早晨百姓就回去，不追赶弟兄了。”
{2Sa 2:28}  So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.
{2Sa 2:28}  于是约押吹角，众民就站住，不再追赶以色列人，也不再打仗了。
{2Sa 2:29}  And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole morning, they came to Mahanaim.
{2Sa 2:29}  押尼珥和跟随他的人整夜经过亚拉巴，过约但河，走过毕伦，到了玛哈念。
{2Sa 2:30}  Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David's servants nineteen men besides Asahel.
{2Sa 2:30}  约押追赶押尼珥回来，聚集众民，见大卫的仆人中缺少了十九个人和亚撒黑。
{2Sa 2:31}  But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner's men.
{2Sa 2:31}  但大卫的仆人杀了便雅悯人和跟随押尼珥的人，共三百六十名。
{2Sa 2:32}  And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.
{2Sa 2:32}  众人将亚撒黑送到伯利恒，葬在他父亲的坟墓里。约押和跟随他的人走了一夜，天亮的时候到了希伯仑。
{2Sa 3:1}   There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. And David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.
{2Sa 3:1}   扫罗家和大卫家争战许久。大卫家日见强盛；扫罗家日见衰弱。
{2Sa 3:2}   And sons were born to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam of Jezreel;
{2Sa 3:2}   大卫在希伯仑得了几个儿子：长子暗嫩是耶斯列人亚希暖所生的；
{2Sa 3:3}   and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
{2Sa 3:3}   次子基利押（在历代上三章一节作但以利）是作过迦密人拿八的妻亚比该所生的；三子押沙龙是基述王达买的女儿玛迦所生的；
{2Sa 3:4}   and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
{2Sa 3:4}   四子亚多尼雅是哈及所生的；五子示法提雅是亚比他所生的；
{2Sa 3:5}   and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
{2Sa 3:5}   六子以特念是大卫的妻以格拉所生的。大卫这六个儿子都是在希伯仑生的。
{2Sa 3:6}   While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.
{2Sa 3:6}   扫罗家和大卫家争战的时候，押尼珥在扫罗家大有权势。
{2Sa 3:7}   Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth said to Abner, "Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?"
{2Sa 3:7}   扫罗有一妃嫔，名叫利斯巴，是爱亚的女儿。一日，伊施波设对押尼珥说：“你为什么与我父的妃嫔同房呢？”
{2Sa 3:8}   Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, "Am I a dog's head of Judah? To this day I keep showing steadfast love to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David. And yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman.
{2Sa 3:8}   押尼珥因伊施波设的话就甚发怒，说：“我岂是犹大的狗头呢？我恩待你父扫罗的家和他的弟兄、朋友，不将你交在大卫手里，今日你竟为这妇人责备我吗？
{2Sa 3:9}   God do so to Abner and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what the LORD has sworn to him,
{2Sa 3:9}   (SEE 3:10)
{2Sa 3:10}  to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba."
{2Sa 3:10}  我若不照着耶和华起誓应许大卫的话行，废去扫罗的位，建立大卫的位，使他治理以色列和犹大，从但直到别是巴，愿神重重的降罚与我！”
{2Sa 3:11}  And Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
{2Sa 3:11}  伊施波设惧怕押尼珥，不敢回答一句。
{2Sa 3:12}  And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, "To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you."
{2Sa 3:12}  押尼珥打发人去见大卫，替他说：“这国归谁呢？”又说：“你与我立约，我必帮助你，使以色列人都归服你。”
{2Sa 3:13}  And he said, "Good; I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you; that is, you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face."
{2Sa 3:13}  大卫说：“好！我与你立约。但有一件，你来见我面的时候，若不将扫罗的女儿米甲带来，必不得见我的面。”
{2Sa 3:14}  Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, for whom I paid the bridal price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
{2Sa 3:14}  大卫就打发人去见扫罗的儿子伊施波设，说：“你要将我的妻米甲归还我；他是我从前用一百非利士人的阳皮所聘定的。”
{2Sa 3:15}  And Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish.
{2Sa 3:15}  伊施波设就打发人去，将米甲从拉亿的儿子、他丈夫帕铁那里接回来。
{2Sa 3:16}  But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go, return." And he returned.
{2Sa 3:16}  米甲的丈夫跟着他，一面走一面哭，直跟到巴户琳。押尼珥说：“你回去吧！”帕铁就回去了。
{2Sa 3:17}  And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, "For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you.
{2Sa 3:17}  押尼珥对以色列长老说：“从前你们愿意大卫作王治理你们，
{2Sa 3:18}  Now then bring it about, for the LORD has promised David, saying, 'By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.'"
{2Sa 3:18}  现在你们可以照心愿而行。因为耶和华曾论到大卫说：‘我必藉我仆人大卫的手，救我民以色列脱离非利士人和众仇敌的手。’”
{2Sa 3:19}  Abner also spoke to Benjamin. And then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.
{2Sa 3:19}  押尼珥也用这话说给便雅悯人听，又到希伯仑，将以色列人和便雅悯全家一切所喜悦的事说给大卫听。
{2Sa 3:20}  When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
{2Sa 3:20}  押尼珥带着二十个人来到希伯仑见大卫，大卫就为押尼珥和他带来的人设摆筵席。
{2Sa 3:21}  And Abner said to David, "I will arise and go and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
{2Sa 3:21}  押尼珥对大卫说：“我要起身去招聚以色列众人来见我主我王，与你立约，你就可以照着心愿作王。”于是大卫送押尼珥去，押尼珥就平平安安的去了。
{2Sa 3:22}  Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
{2Sa 3:22}  约押和大卫的仆人攻击敌军，带回许多的掠物。那时押尼珥不在希伯仑大卫那里，因大卫已经送他去，他也平平安安的去了。
{2Sa 3:23}  When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, "Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace."
{2Sa 3:23}  约押和跟随他的全军到了，就有人告诉约押说：“尼珥的儿子押尼珥来见王，王送他去，他也平平安安的去了。”
{2Sa 3:24}  Then Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone?
{2Sa 3:24}  约押去见王说：“你这是做什么呢？押尼珥来见你，你为何送他去，他就踪影不见了呢？
{2Sa 3:25}  You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing."
{2Sa 3:25}  你当晓得，尼珥的儿子押尼珥来是要诓哄你，要知道你的出入和你一切所行的事。”
{2Sa 3:26}  When Joab came out from David's presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah. But David did not know about it.
{2Sa 3:26}  约押从大卫那里出来，就打发人去追赶押尼珥，在西拉井追上他，将他带回来，大卫却不知道。
{2Sa 3:27}  And when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the stomach, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
{2Sa 3:27}  押尼珥回到希伯仑，约押领他到城门的瓮洞，假作要与他说机密话，就在那里刺透他的肚腹，他便死了。这是报杀他兄弟亚撒黑的仇。
{2Sa 3:28}  Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD for the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
{2Sa 3:28}  大卫听见了，就说：“流尼珥的儿子押尼珥的血，这罪在耶和华面前必永不归我和我的国。
{2Sa 3:29}  May it fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house, and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge or who is leprous or who holds a spindle or who falls by the sword or who lacks bread!"
{2Sa 3:29}  愿流他血的罪归到约押头上和他父的全家；又愿约押家不断有患漏症的，长大麻疯的，架拐而行的，被刀杀死的，缺乏饮食的。”
{2Sa 3:30}  So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.
{2Sa 3:30}  约押和他兄弟亚比筛杀了押尼珥，是因押尼珥在基遍争战的时候杀了他们的兄弟亚撒黑。
{2Sa 3:31}  Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner." And King David followed the bier.
{2Sa 3:31}  大卫吩咐约押和跟随他的众人说：“你们当撕裂衣服，腰束麻布，在押尼珥棺前哀哭。”大卫王也跟在棺后。
{2Sa 3:32}  They buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
{2Sa 3:32}  他们将押尼珥葬在希伯仑。王在押尼珥的墓旁放声而哭，众民也都哭了。
{2Sa 3:33}  And the king lamented for Abner, saying, "Should Abner die as a fool dies?
{2Sa 3:33}  王为押尼珥举哀，说：押尼珥何竟像愚顽人死呢？
{2Sa 3:34}  Your hands were not bound; your feet were not fettered; as one falls before the wicked you have fallen." And all the people wept again over him.
{2Sa 3:34}  你手未曾捆绑，脚未曾锁住。你死，如人死在罪孽之辈手下一样。于是众民又为押尼珥哀哭。
{2Sa 3:35}  Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day. But David swore, saying, "God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!"
{2Sa 3:35}  日头未落的时候，众民来劝大卫吃饭，但大卫起誓说：“我若在日头未落以前吃饭，或吃别物，愿神重重的降罚与我！”
{2Sa 3:36}  And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as everything that the king did pleased all the people.
{2Sa 3:36}  众民知道了就都喜悦。凡王所行的，众民无不喜悦。
{2Sa 3:37}  So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king's will to put to death Abner the son of Ner.
{2Sa 3:37}  那日，以色列众民才知道杀尼珥的儿子押尼珥并非出于王意。
{2Sa 3:38}  And the king said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
{2Sa 3:38}  王对臣仆说：“你们岂不知今日以色列人中死了一个作元帅的大丈夫吗？
{2Sa 3:39}  And I was gentle today, though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are more severe than I. The LORD repay the evildoer according to his wickedness!"
{2Sa 3:39}  我虽然受膏为王，今日还是软弱；这洗鲁雅的两个儿子比我刚强。愿耶和华照着恶人所行的恶报应他。”
{2Sa 4:1}   When Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, heard that Abner had died at Hebron, his courage failed, and all Israel was dismayed.
{2Sa 4:1}   扫罗的儿子伊施波设听见押尼珥死在希伯仑，手就发软；以色列众人也都惊惶。
{2Sa 4:2}   Now Saul's son had two men who were captains of raiding bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon a man of Benjamin from Beeroth (for Beeroth also is counted part of Benjamin;
{2Sa 4:2}   扫罗的儿子伊施波设有两个军长，一名巴拿，一名利甲，是便雅悯支派、比录人临门的儿子。比录也属便雅悯。
{2Sa 4:3}   the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been sojourners there to this day).
{2Sa 4:3}   比录人早先逃到基他音，在那里寄居，直到今日。
{2Sa 4:4}   Jonathan, the son of Saul, had a son who was crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled, and as she fled in her haste, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
{2Sa 4:4}   扫罗的儿子约拿单有一个儿子名叫米非波设，是瘸腿的。扫罗和约拿单死亡的消息从耶斯列传到的时候，他才五岁。他乳母抱着他逃跑；因为跑得太急，孩子掉在地上，腿就瘸了。
{2Sa 4:5}   Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-bosheth as he was taking his noonday rest.
{2Sa 4:5}   一日，比录人临门的两个儿子利甲和巴拿出去，约在午热的时候到了伊施波设的家；伊施波设正睡午觉。
{2Sa 4:6}   And they came into the midst of the house as if to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
{2Sa 4:6}   他们进了房子，假作要取麦子，就刺透伊施波设的肚腹，逃跑了。
{2Sa 4:7}   When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and put him to death and beheaded him. They took his head and went by the way of the Arabah all night,
{2Sa 4:7}   他们进房子的时候，伊施波设正在卧房里躺在床上，他们将他杀死，割了他的首级，拿着首级在亚拉巴走了一夜，
{2Sa 4:8}   and brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron. And they said to the king, "Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. The LORD has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring."
{2Sa 4:8}   将伊施波设的首级拿到希伯仑见大卫王，说：“王的仇敌扫罗曾寻索王的性命。看哪，这是他儿子伊施波设的首级；耶和华今日为我主我王在扫罗和他后裔的身上报了仇。”
{2Sa 4:9}   But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity,
{2Sa 4:9}   大卫对比录人临门的儿子利甲和他兄弟巴拿说：“我指着救我性命脱离一切苦难、永生的耶和华起誓：
{2Sa 4:10}  when one told me, 'Behold, Saul is dead,' and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.
{2Sa 4:10}  从前有人报告我说，扫罗死了，他自以为报好消息；我就拿住他，将他杀在洗革拉，这就作了他报消息的赏赐。
{2Sa 4:11}  How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and destroy you from the earth?"
{2Sa 4:11}  何况恶人将义人杀在他的床上，我岂不向你们讨流他血的罪、从世上除灭你们呢？”
{2Sa 4:12}  And David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.
{2Sa 4:12}  于是大卫吩咐少年人将他们杀了，砍断他们的手脚，挂在希伯仑的池旁，却将伊施波设的首级葬在希伯仑押尼珥的坟墓里。
{2Sa 5:1}   Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Behold, we are your bone and flesh.
{2Sa 5:1}   以色列众支派来到希伯仑见大卫，说：“我们原是你的骨肉。
{2Sa 5:2}   In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the LORD said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.'"
{2Sa 5:2}   从前扫罗作我们王的时候，率领以色列人出入的是你；耶和华也曾应许你说：‘你必牧养我的民以色列，作以色列的君。’”
{2Sa 5:3}   So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel.
{2Sa 5:3}   于是以色列的长老都来到希伯仑见大卫王，大卫在希伯仑耶和华面前与他们立约，他们就膏大卫作以色列的王。
{2Sa 5:4}   David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
{2Sa 5:4}   大卫登基的时候年三十岁，在位四十年；
{2Sa 5:5}   At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.
{2Sa 5:5}   在希伯仑作犹大王七年零六个月，在耶路撒冷作以色列和犹大王三十三年。
{2Sa 5:6}   And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, "You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame will ward you off"--thinking, "David cannot come in here."
{2Sa 5:6}   大卫和跟随他的人到了耶路撒冷，要攻打住那地方的耶布斯人。耶布斯人对大卫说：“你若不赶出瞎子、瘸子，必不能进这地方”；心里想大卫决不能进去。
{2Sa 5:7}   Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
{2Sa 5:7}   然而大卫攻取锡安的保障，就是大卫的城。
{2Sa 5:8}   And David said on that day, "Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack 'the lame and the blind,' who are hated by David's soul." Therefore it is said, "The blind and the lame shall not come into the house."
{2Sa 5:8}   当日，大卫说：“谁攻打耶布斯人，当上水沟攻打我心里所恨恶的瘸子、瞎子。”从此有俗语说：“在那里有瞎子、瘸子，他不能进屋去。”
{2Sa 5:9}   And David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built the city all around from the Millo inward.
{2Sa 5:9}   大卫住在保障里，给保障起名叫大卫城。大卫又从米罗以里，周围筑墙。
{2Sa 5:10}  And David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.
{2Sa 5:10}  大卫日见强盛，因为耶和华万军之神与他同在。
{2Sa 5:11}  And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also carpenters and masons who built David a house.
{2Sa 5:11}  推罗王希兰将香柏木运到大卫那里，又差遣使者和木匠、石匠给大卫建造宫殿。
{2Sa 5:12}  And David knew that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
{2Sa 5:12}  大卫就知道耶和华坚立他作以色列王，又为自己的民以色列使他的国兴旺。
{2Sa 5:13}  And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David.
{2Sa 5:13}  大卫离开希伯仑之后，在耶路撒冷又立后妃，又生儿女。
{2Sa 5:14}  And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
{2Sa 5:14}  在耶路撒冷所生的儿子是沙母亚、朔罢、拿单、所罗门、
{2Sa 5:15}  Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
{2Sa 5:15}  益辖、以利书亚、尼斐、雅非亚、
{2Sa 5:16}  Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
{2Sa 5:16}  以利沙玛、以利雅大、以利法列。
{2Sa 5:17}  When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.
{2Sa 5:17}  非利士人听见人膏大卫作以色列王，非利士众人就上来寻索大卫；大卫听见，就下到保障。
{2Sa 5:18}  Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
{2Sa 5:18}  非利士人来了，布散在利乏音谷。
{2Sa 5:19}  And David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?" And the LORD said to David, "Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand."
{2Sa 5:19}  大卫求问耶和华说：“我可以上去攻打非利士人吗？你将他们交在我手里吗？”耶和华说：“你可以上去，我必将非利士人交在你手里。”
{2Sa 5:20}  And David came to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there. And he said, "The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like a breaking flood." Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim.
{2Sa 5:20}  大卫来到巴力毗拉心，在那里击杀非利士人，说：“耶和华在我面前冲破敌人，如同水冲去一般。”因此称那地方为巴力毗拉心。
{2Sa 5:21}  And the Philistines left their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.
{2Sa 5:21}  非利士人将偶像撇在那里，大卫和跟随他的人拿去了。
{2Sa 5:22}  And the Philistines came up yet again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
{2Sa 5:22}  非利士人又上来，布散在利乏音谷。
{2Sa 5:23}  And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, "You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come against them opposite the balsam trees.
{2Sa 5:23}  大卫求问耶和华；耶和华说：“不要一直地上去，要转到他们后头，从桑林对面攻打他们。
{2Sa 5:24}  And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then rouse yourself, for then the LORD has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines."
{2Sa 5:24}  你听见桑树梢上有脚步的声音，就要急速前去，因为那时耶和华已经在你前头去攻打非利士人的军队。”
{2Sa 5:25}  And David did as the LORD commanded him, and struck down the Philistines from Geba to Gezer.
{2Sa 5:25}  大卫就遵着耶和华所吩咐的去行，攻打非利士人，从迦巴直到基色。
{2Sa 6:1}   David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
{2Sa 6:1}   大卫又聚集以色列中所有挑选的人三万。
{2Sa 6:2}   And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD of hosts who sits enthroned on the cherubim.
{2Sa 6:2}   大卫起身，率领跟随他的众人前往，要从巴拉犹大将神的约柜运来；这约柜就是坐在二基路伯上万军之耶和华留名的约柜。
{2Sa 6:3}   And they carried the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. And Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart,
{2Sa 6:3}   他们将神的约柜从冈上亚比拿达的家里抬出来，放在新车上；亚比拿达的两个儿子乌撒和亚希约赶这新车。
{2Sa 6:4}   with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark.
{2Sa 6:4}   他们将神的约柜从冈上亚比拿达家里抬出来的时候，亚希约在柜前行走。
{2Sa 6:5}   And David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals.
{2Sa 6:5}   大卫和以色列的全家在耶和华面前，用松木制造的各样乐器和琴、瑟、鼓、钹、锣，作乐跳舞。
{2Sa 6:6}   And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled.
{2Sa 6:6}   到了拿艮的禾场，因为牛失前蹄（或作：惊跳），乌撒就伸手扶住神的约柜。
{2Sa 6:7}   And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down there because of his error, and he died there beside the ark of God.
{2Sa 6:7}   神耶和华向乌撒发怒，因这错误击杀他，他就死在神的约柜旁。
{2Sa 6:8}   And David was angry because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day.
{2Sa 6:8}   大卫因耶和华击杀（原文作闯杀）乌撒，心里愁烦，就称那地方为毗列斯乌撒，直到今日。
{2Sa 6:9}   And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and he said, "How can the ark of the LORD come to me?"
{2Sa 6:9}   那日，大卫惧怕耶和华，说：“耶和华的约柜怎可运到我这里来？”
{2Sa 6:10}  So David was not willing to take the ark of the LORD into the city of David. But David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
{2Sa 6:10}  于是大卫不肯将耶和华的约柜运进大卫的城，却运到迦特人俄别以东的家中。
{2Sa 6:11}  And the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.
{2Sa 6:11}  耶和华的约柜在迦特人俄别以东家中三个月；耶和华赐福给俄别以东和他的全家。
{2Sa 6:12}  And it was told King David, "The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God." So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing.
{2Sa 6:12}  有人告诉大卫王说：“耶和华因为约柜赐福给俄别以东的家和一切属他的。”大卫就去，欢欢喜喜地将神的约柜从俄别以东家中抬到大卫的城里。
{2Sa 6:13}  And when those who bore the ark of the LORD had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal.
{2Sa 6:13}  抬耶和华约柜的人走了六步，大卫就献牛与肥羊为祭。
{2Sa 6:14}  And David danced before the LORD with all his might. And David was wearing a linen ephod.
{2Sa 6:14}  大卫穿着细麻布的以弗得，在耶和华面前极力跳舞。
{2Sa 6:15}  So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the horn.
{2Sa 6:15}  这样，大卫和以色列的全家欢呼吹角，将耶和华的约柜抬上来。
{2Sa 6:16}  As the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart.
{2Sa 6:16}  耶和华的约柜进了大卫城的时候，扫罗的女儿米甲从窗户里观看，见大卫王在耶和华面前踊跃跳舞，心里就轻视他。
{2Sa 6:17}  And they brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place, inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
{2Sa 6:17}  众人将耶和华的约柜请进去，安放在所预备的地方，就是在大卫所搭的帐幕里。大卫在耶和华面前献燔祭和平安祭。
{2Sa 6:18}  And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts
{2Sa 6:18}  大卫献完了燔祭和平安祭，就奉万军之耶和华的名给民祝福，
{2Sa 6:19}  and distributed among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins to each one. Then all the people departed, each to his house.
{2Sa 6:19}  并且分给以色列众人，无论男女，每人一个饼，一块肉，一个葡萄饼；众人就各回各家去了。
{2Sa 6:20}  And David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, "How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants' female servants, as one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!"
{2Sa 6:20}  大卫回家要给眷属祝福；扫罗的女儿米甲出来迎接他，说：“以色列王今日在臣仆的婢女眼前露体，如同一个轻贱人无耻露体一样，有好大的荣耀啊！”
{2Sa 6:21}  And David said to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me as prince over Israel, the people of the LORD--and I will celebrate before the LORD.
{2Sa 6:21}  大卫对米甲说：“这是在耶和华面前；耶和华已拣选我，废了你父和你父的全家，立我作耶和华民以色列的君，所以我必在耶和华面前跳舞。
{2Sa 6:22}  I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in your eyes. But by the female servants of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor."
{2Sa 6:22}  我也必更加卑微，自己看为轻贱。你所说的那些婢女，他们倒要尊敬我。”
{2Sa 6:23}  And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
{2Sa 6:23}  扫罗的女儿米甲，直到死日，没有生养儿女。
{2Sa 7:1}   Now when the king lived in his house and the LORD had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies,
{2Sa 7:1}   王住在自己宫中，耶和华使他安靖，不被四围的仇敌扰乱。
{2Sa 7:2}   the king said to Nathan the prophet, "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent."
{2Sa 7:2}   那时，王对先知拿单说：“看哪，我住在香柏木的宫中，神的约柜反在幔子里。”
{2Sa 7:3}   And Nathan said to the king, "Go, do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you."
{2Sa 7:3}   拿单对王说：“你可以照你的心意而行，因为耶和华与你同在。”
{2Sa 7:4}   But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan,
{2Sa 7:4}   当夜，耶和华的话临到拿单说：
{2Sa 7:5}   "Go and tell my servant David, 'Thus says the LORD: Would you build me a house to dwell in?
{2Sa 7:5}   “你去告诉我仆人大卫，说耶和华如此说：‘你岂可建造殿宇给我居住呢？
{2Sa 7:6}   I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling.
{2Sa 7:6}   自从我领以色列人出埃及直到今日，我未曾住过殿宇，常在会幕和帐幕中行走。
{2Sa 7:7}   In all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'
{2Sa 7:7}   凡我同以色列人所走的地方，我何曾向以色列一支派的士师，就是我吩咐牧养我民以色列的说：你们为何不给我建造香柏木的殿宇呢？’
{2Sa 7:8}   Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel.
{2Sa 7:8}   “现在，你要告诉我仆人大卫，说万军之耶和华如此说：‘我从羊圈中将你召来，叫你不再跟从羊群，立你作我民以色列的君。
{2Sa 7:9}   And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
{2Sa 7:9}   你无论往那里去，我常与你同在，剪除你的一切仇敌。我必使你得大名，好像世上大大有名的人一样。
{2Sa 7:10}  And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly,
{2Sa 7:10}  我必为我民以色列选定一个地方，栽培他们，使他们住自己的地方，不再迁移；凶恶之子也不像从前扰害他们，
{2Sa 7:11}  from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house.
{2Sa 7:11}  并不像我命士师治理我民以色列的时候一样。我必使你安靖，不被一切仇敌扰乱，并且我耶和华应许你，必为你建立家室。
{2Sa 7:12}  When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
{2Sa 7:12}  你寿数满足、与你列祖同睡的时候，我必使你的后裔接续你的位；我也必坚定他的国。
{2Sa 7:13}  He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
{2Sa 7:13}  他必为我的名建造殿宇；我必坚定他的国位，直到永远。
{2Sa 7:14}  I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men,
{2Sa 7:14}  我要作他的父，他要作我的子；他若犯了罪，我必用人的杖责打他，用人的鞭责罚他。
{2Sa 7:15}  but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you.
{2Sa 7:15}  但我的慈爱仍不离开他，像离开在你面前所废弃的扫罗一样。
{2Sa 7:16}  And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.'"
{2Sa 7:16}  你的家和你的国必在我（原文作你）面前永远坚立。你的国位也必坚定，直到永远。’”
{2Sa 7:17}  In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
{2Sa 7:17}  拿单就按这一切话，照这默示，告诉大卫。
{2Sa 7:18}  Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said, "Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
{2Sa 7:18}  于是大卫王进去，坐在耶和华面前，说：“主耶和华啊，我是谁？我的家算什么？你竟使我到这地步呢？
{2Sa 7:19}  And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O Lord GOD. You have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come, and this is instruction for mankind, O Lord GOD!
{2Sa 7:19}  主耶和华啊，这在你眼中还看为小，又应许你仆人的家至于久远。主耶和华啊，这岂是人所常遇的事吗？
{2Sa 7:20}  And what more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Lord GOD!
{2Sa 7:20}  主耶和华啊，我还有何言可以对你说呢？因为你知道你的仆人。
{2Sa 7:21}  Because of your promise, and according to your own heart, you have brought about all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
{2Sa 7:21}  你行这大事使仆人知道，是因你所应许的话，也是照你的心意。
{2Sa 7:22}  Therefore you are great, O LORD God. For there is none like you, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
{2Sa 7:22}  主耶和华啊，你本为大，照我们耳中听见，没有可比你的；除你以外再无神。
{2Sa 7:23}  And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making himself a name and doing for them great and awesome things by driving out before your people, whom you redeemed for yourself from Egypt, a nation and its gods?
{2Sa 7:23}  世上有何民能比你的民以色列呢？你从埃及救赎他们作自己的子民，又在你赎出来的民面前行大而可畏的事，驱逐列邦人和他们的神，显出你的大名。
{2Sa 7:24}  And you established for yourself your people Israel to be your people forever. And you, O LORD, became their God.
{2Sa 7:24}  你曾坚立你的民以色列作你的子民，直到永远；你耶和华也作了他们的神。
{2Sa 7:25}  And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, and do as you have spoken.
{2Sa 7:25}  “耶和华神啊，你所应许仆人和仆人家的话，求你坚定，直到永远；照你所说的而行。
{2Sa 7:26}  And your name will be magnified forever, saying, 'The LORD of hosts is God over Israel,' and the house of your servant David will be established before you.
{2Sa 7:26}  愿人永远尊你的名为大，说：‘万军之耶和华是治理以色列的神。’这样，你仆人大卫的家必在你面前坚立。
{2Sa 7:27}  For you, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made this revelation to your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house.' Therefore your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you.
{2Sa 7:27}  万军之耶和华以色列的神啊，因你启示你的仆人说：‘我必为你建立家室’，所以仆人大胆向你如此祈祷。
{2Sa 7:28}  And now, O Lord GOD, you are God, and your words are true, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.
{2Sa 7:28}  “主耶和华啊，惟有你是神。你的话是真实的；你也应许将这福气赐给仆人。
{2Sa 7:29}  Now therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you, O Lord GOD, have spoken, and with your blessing shall the house of your servant be blessed forever."
{2Sa 7:29}  现在求你赐福与仆人的家，可以永存在你面前。主耶和华啊，这是你所应许的。愿你永远赐福与仆人的家！”
{2Sa 8:1}   After this David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
{2Sa 8:1}   此后，大卫攻打非利士人，把他们治服，从他们手下夺取了京城的权柄（原文作母城的嚼环）；
{2Sa 8:2}   And he defeated Moab and he measured them with a line, making them lie down on the ground. Two lines he measured to be put to death, and one full line to be spared. And the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.
{2Sa 8:2}   又攻打摩押人，使他们躺卧在地上，用绳量一量：量二绳的杀了，量一绳的存留。摩押人就归服大卫，给他进贡。
{2Sa 8:3}   David also defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his power at the river Euphrates.
{2Sa 8:3}   琐巴王利合的儿子哈大底谢往大河去，要夺回他的国权。大卫就攻打他，
{2Sa 8:4}   And David took from him 1,700 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses but left enough for 100 chariots.
{2Sa 8:4}   擒拿了他的马兵一千七百，步兵二万，将拉战车的马砍断蹄筋，但留下一百辆车的马。
{2Sa 8:5}   And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 men of the Syrians.
{2Sa 8:5}   大马色的亚兰人来帮助琐巴王哈大底谢，大卫就杀了亚兰人二万二千。
{2Sa 8:6}   Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
{2Sa 8:6}   于是大卫在大马色的亚兰地设立防营，亚兰人就归服他，给他进贡。大卫无论往那里去，耶和华都使他得胜。
{2Sa 8:7}   And David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
{2Sa 8:7}   他夺了哈大底谢臣仆所拿的金盾牌，带到耶路撒冷。
{2Sa 8:8}   And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took very much bronze.
{2Sa 8:8}   大卫王又从属哈大底谢的比他和比罗他城中夺取了许多的铜。
{2Sa 8:9}   When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer,
{2Sa 8:9}   哈马王陀以听见大卫杀败哈大底谢的全军，
{2Sa 8:10}  Toi sent his son Joram to King David, to ask about his health and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Hadadezer had often been at war with Toi. And Joram brought with him articles of silver, of gold, and of bronze.
{2Sa 8:10}  就打发他儿子约兰去见大卫王，问他的安，为他祝福，因为他杀败了哈大底谢（原来陀以与哈大底谢常常争战）。约兰带了金银铜的器皿来，
{2Sa 8:11}  These also King David dedicated to the LORD, together with the silver and gold that he dedicated from all the nations he subdued,
{2Sa 8:11}  大卫王将这些器皿和他治服各国所得来的金银都分别为圣，献给耶和华，
{2Sa 8:12}  from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
{2Sa 8:12}  就是从亚兰、摩押、亚扪、非利士、亚玛力人所得来的，以及从琐巴王利合的儿子哈大底谢所掠之物。
{2Sa 8:13}  And David made a name for himself when he returned from striking down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
{2Sa 8:13}  大卫在盐谷击杀了亚兰（或作：以东，见诗篇六十篇诗题）一万八千人回来，就得了大名；
{2Sa 8:14}  Then he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became David's servants. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
{2Sa 8:14}  又在以东全地设立防营，以东人就都归服大卫。大卫无论往那里去，耶和华都使他得胜。
{2Sa 8:15}  So David reigned over all Israel. And David administered justice and equity to all his people.
{2Sa 8:15}  大卫作以色列众人的王，又向众民秉公行义。
{2Sa 8:16}  Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder,
{2Sa 8:16}  洗鲁雅的儿子约押作元帅；亚希律的儿子约沙法作史官；
{2Sa 8:17}  and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Seraiah was secretary,
{2Sa 8:17}  亚希突的儿子撒督和亚比亚他的儿子亚希米勒作祭司长；西莱雅作书记；
{2Sa 8:18}  and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David's sons were priests.
{2Sa 8:18}  耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅统辖基利提人和比利提人。大卫的众子都作领袖。
{2Sa 9:1}   And David said, "Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
{2Sa 9:1}   大卫问说：“扫罗家还有剩下的人没有？我要因约拿单的缘故向他施恩。”
{2Sa 9:2}   Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David. And the king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" And he said, "I am your servant."
{2Sa 9:2}   扫罗家有一个仆人，名叫洗巴，有人叫他来见大卫，王问他说：“你是洗巴吗？”回答说：“仆人是。”
{2Sa 9:3}   And the king said, "Is there not still someone of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him?" Ziba said to the king, "There is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in his feet."
{2Sa 9:3}   王说：“扫罗家还有人没有？我要照神的慈爱恩待他。”洗巴对王说：“还有约拿单的一个儿子，是瘸腿的。”
{2Sa 9:4}   The king said to him, "Where is he?" And Ziba said to the king, "He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar."
{2Sa 9:4}   王说：“他在那里？”洗巴对王说：“他在罗底巴，亚米利的儿子玛吉家里。”
{2Sa 9:5}   Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.
{2Sa 9:5}   于是大卫王打发人去，从罗底巴亚米利的儿子玛吉家里召了他来。
{2Sa 9:6}   And Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and paid homage. And David said, "Mephibosheth!" And he answered, "Behold, I am your servant."
{2Sa 9:6}   扫罗的孙子、约拿单的儿子米非波设来见大卫，伏地叩拜。大卫说：“米非波设！”米非波设说：“仆人在此。”
{2Sa 9:7}   And David said to him, "Do not fear, for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your father, and you shall eat at my table always."
{2Sa 9:7}   大卫说：“你不要惧怕，我必因你父亲约拿单的缘故施恩与你，将你祖父扫罗的一切田地都归还你；你也可以常与我同席吃饭。”
{2Sa 9:8}   And he paid homage and said, "What is your servant, that you should show regard for a dead dog such as I?"
{2Sa 9:8}   米非波设又叩拜，说：“仆人算什么，不过如死狗一般，竟蒙王这样眷顾！”
{2Sa 9:9}   Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, "All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master's grandson.
{2Sa 9:9}   王召了扫罗的仆人洗巴来，对他说：“我已将属扫罗和他的一切家产都赐给你主人的儿子了。
{2Sa 9:10}  And you and your sons and your servants shall till the land for him and shall bring in the produce, that your master's grandson may have bread to eat. But Mephibosheth your master's grandson shall always eat at my table." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
{2Sa 9:10}  你和你的众子、仆人要为你主人的儿子米非波设耕种田地，把所产的拿来供他食用；他却要常与我同席吃饭。”洗巴有十五个儿子，二十个仆人。
{2Sa 9:11}  Then Ziba said to the king, "According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so will your servant do." So Mephibosheth ate at David's table, like one of the king's sons.
{2Sa 9:11}  洗巴对王说：“凡我主我王吩咐仆人的，仆人都必遵行。”王又说：“米非波设必与我同席吃饭，如王的儿子一样。”
{2Sa 9:12}  And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all who lived in Ziba's house became Mephibosheth's servants.
{2Sa 9:12}  米非波设有一个小儿子，名叫米迦。凡住在洗巴家里的人都作了米非波设的仆人。
{2Sa 9:13}  So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate always at the king's table. Now he was lame in both his feet.
{2Sa 9:13}  于是米非波设住在耶路撒冷，常与王同席吃饭。他两腿都是瘸的。
{2Sa 10:1}  After this the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
{2Sa 10:1}  此后，亚扪人的王死了，他儿子哈嫩接续他作王。
{2Sa 10:2}  And David said, "I will deal loyally with Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father dealt loyally with me." So David sent by his servants to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the Ammonites.
{2Sa 10:2}  大卫说：“我要照哈嫩的父亲拿辖厚待我的恩典厚待哈嫩。”于是大卫差遣臣仆，为他丧父安慰他。大卫的臣仆到了亚扪人的境内。
{2Sa 10:3}  But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, "Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it?"
{2Sa 10:3}  但亚扪人的首领对他们的主哈嫩说：“大卫差人来安慰你，你想他是尊敬你父亲吗？他差臣仆来不是详察窥探、要倾覆这城吗？”
{2Sa 10:4}  So Hanun took David's servants and shaved off half the beard of each and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away.
{2Sa 10:4}  哈嫩便将大卫臣仆的胡须剃去一半，又割断他们下半截的衣服，使他们露出下体，打发他们回去。
{2Sa 10:5}  When it was told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, "Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return."
{2Sa 10:5}  有人告诉大卫，他就差人去迎接他们，（因为他们甚觉羞耻），告诉他们说：“可以住在耶利哥，等到胡须长起再回来。”
{2Sa 10:6}  When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob, 12,000 men.
{2Sa 10:6}  亚扪人知道大卫憎恶他们，就打发人去，招募伯利合的亚兰人和琐巴的亚兰人，步兵二万，与玛迦王的人一千、陀伯人一万二千。
{2Sa 10:7}  And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men.
{2Sa 10:7}  大卫听见了，就差派约押统带勇猛的全军出去。
{2Sa 10:8}  And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate, and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.
{2Sa 10:8}  亚扪人出来，在城门前摆阵；琐巴与利合的亚兰人、陀伯人，并玛迦人，另在郊野摆阵。
{2Sa 10:9}  When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians.
{2Sa 10:9}  约押看见敌人在他前后摆阵，就从以色列军中挑选精兵，使他们对着亚兰人摆阵。
{2Sa 10:10} The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed them against the Ammonites.
{2Sa 10:10} 其余的兵交与他兄弟亚比筛，对着亚扪人摆阵。
{2Sa 10:11} And he said, "If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
{2Sa 10:11} 约押对亚比筛说：“亚兰人若强过我，你就来帮助我；亚扪人若强过你，我就去帮助你。
{2Sa 10:12} Be of good courage, and let us be courageous for our people, and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good to him."
{2Sa 10:12} 我们都当刚强，为本国的民和神的城邑作大丈夫。愿耶和华凭他的意旨而行！”
{2Sa 10:13} So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.
{2Sa 10:13} 于是，约押和跟随他的人前进攻打亚兰人；亚兰人在约押面前逃跑。
{2Sa 10:14} And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
{2Sa 10:14} 亚扪人见亚兰人逃跑，他们也在亚比筛面前逃跑进城。约押就离开亚扪人那里，回耶路撒冷去了。
{2Sa 10:15} But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.
{2Sa 10:15} 亚兰人见自己被以色列人打败，就又聚集。
{2Sa 10:16} And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates. They came to Helam, with Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
{2Sa 10:16} 哈大底谢差遣人，将大河那边的亚兰人调来；他们到了希兰，哈大底谢的将军朔法率领他们。
{2Sa 10:17} And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to Helam. The Syrians arrayed themselves against David and fought with him.
{2Sa 10:17} 有人告诉大卫，他就聚集以色列众人，过约但河，来到希兰。亚兰人迎着大卫摆阵，与他打仗。
{2Sa 10:18} And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 700 chariots, and 40,000 horsemen, and wounded Shobach the commander of their army, so that he died there.
{2Sa 10:18} 亚兰人在以色列人面前逃跑；大卫杀了亚兰七百辆战车的人，四万马兵，又杀了亚兰的将军朔法。
{2Sa 10:19} And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became subject to them. So the Syrians were afraid to save the Ammonites anymore.
{2Sa 10:19} 属哈大底谢的诸王见自己被以色列人打败，就与以色列人和好，归服他们。于是亚兰人不敢再帮助亚扪人了。
{2Sa 11:1}  In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.
{2Sa 11:1}  过了一年，到列王出战的时候，大卫又差派约押，率领臣仆和以色列众人出战。他们就打败亚扪人，围攻拉巴。大卫仍住在耶路撒冷。
{2Sa 11:2}  It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.
{2Sa 11:2}  一日，太阳平西，大卫从床上起来，在王宫的平顶上游行，看见一个妇人沐浴，容貌甚美，
{2Sa 11:3}  And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, "Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
{2Sa 11:3}  大卫就差人打听那妇人是谁。有人说：“他是以连的女儿，赫人乌利亚的妻拔示巴。”
{2Sa 11:4}  So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house.
{2Sa 11:4}  大卫差人去，将妇人接来；那时他的月经才得洁净。他来了，大卫与他同房，他就回家去了。
{2Sa 11:5}  And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, "I am pregnant."
{2Sa 11:5}  于是他怀了孕，打发人去告诉大卫说：“我怀了孕。”
{2Sa 11:6}  So David sent word to Joab, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent Uriah to David.
{2Sa 11:6}  大卫差人到约押那里，说：“你打发赫人乌利亚到我这里来。”约押就打发乌利亚去见大卫。
{2Sa 11:7}  When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the war was going.
{2Sa 11:7}  乌利亚来了，大卫问约押好，也问兵好，又问争战的事怎样。
{2Sa 11:8}  Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." And Uriah went out of the king's house, and there followed him a present from the king.
{2Sa 11:8}  大卫对乌利亚说：“你回家去，洗洗脚吧！”乌利亚出了王宫，随后王送他一分食物。
{2Sa 11:9}  But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
{2Sa 11:9}  乌利亚却和他主人的仆人一同睡在宫门外，没有回家去。
{2Sa 11:10} When they told David, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"
{2Sa 11:10} 有人告诉大卫说：“乌利亚没有回家去。”大卫就问乌利亚说：“你从远路上来，为什么不回家去呢？”
{2Sa 11:11} Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing."
{2Sa 11:11} 乌利亚对大卫说：“约柜和以色列与犹大兵都住在棚里，我主约押和我主（或作：王）的仆人都在田野安营，我岂可回家吃喝、与妻子同寝呢？我敢在王面前起誓（原文作我指着王和王的性命起誓）：我决不行这事！”
{2Sa 11:12} Then David said to Uriah, "Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
{2Sa 11:12} 大卫吩咐乌利亚说：“你今日仍住在这里，明日我打发你去。”于是乌利亚那日和次日住在耶路撒冷。
{2Sa 11:13} And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.
{2Sa 11:13} 大卫召了乌利亚来，叫他在自己面前吃喝，使他喝醉。到了晚上，乌利亚出去与他主的仆人一同住宿，还没有回到家里去。
{2Sa 11:14} In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
{2Sa 11:14} 次日早晨，大卫写信与约押，交乌利亚随手带去。
{2Sa 11:15} In the letter he wrote, "Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die."
{2Sa 11:15} 信内写着说：“要派乌利亚前进，到阵势极险之处，你们便退后，使他被杀。”
{2Sa 11:16} And as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men.
{2Sa 11:16} 约押围城的时候，知道敌人那里有勇士，便将乌利亚派在那里。
{2Sa 11:17} And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriah the Hittite also died.
{2Sa 11:17} 城里的人出来和约押打仗；大卫的仆人中有几个被杀的，赫人乌利亚也死了。
{2Sa 11:18} Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting.
{2Sa 11:18} 于是，约押差人去将争战的一切事告诉大卫，
{2Sa 11:19} And he instructed the messenger, "When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king,
{2Sa 11:19} 又嘱咐使者说：“你把争战的一切事对王说完了，
{2Sa 11:20} then, if the king's anger rises, and if he says to you, 'Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?
{2Sa 11:20} 王若发怒，问你说：‘你们打仗为什么挨近城墙呢？岂不知敌人必从城上射箭吗？
{2Sa 11:21} Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"
{2Sa 11:21} 从前打死耶路比设（就是耶路巴力，见士师记九章一节）儿子亚比米勒的是谁呢？岂不是一个妇人从城上抛下一块上磨石来，打在他身上，他就死在提备斯吗？你们为什么挨近城墙呢？’你就说：‘王的仆人赫人乌利亚也死了。’”
{2Sa 11:22} So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell.
{2Sa 11:22} 使者起身，来见大卫，照着约押所吩咐他的话奏告大卫。
{2Sa 11:23} The messenger said to David, "The men gained an advantage over us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.
{2Sa 11:23} 使者对大卫说：“敌人强过我们，出到郊野与我们打仗，我们追杀他们，直到城门口。
{2Sa 11:24} Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
{2Sa 11:24} 射箭的从城上射王的仆人，射死几个，赫人乌利亚也死了。”
{2Sa 11:25} David said to the messenger, "Thus shall you say to Joab, 'Do not let this matter displease you, for the sword devours now one and now another. Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it.' And encourage him."
{2Sa 11:25} 王向使者说：“你告诉约押说：‘不要因这事愁闷，刀剑或吞灭这人或吞灭那人，没有一定的；你只管竭力攻城，将城倾覆。’可以用这话勉励约押。”
{2Sa 11:26} When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented over her husband.
{2Sa 11:26} 乌利亚的妻听见丈夫乌利亚死了，就为他哀哭。
{2Sa 11:27} And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.
{2Sa 11:27} 哀哭的日子过了，大卫差人将他接到宫里，他就作了大卫的妻，给大卫生了一个儿子。但大卫所行的这事，耶和华甚不喜悦。
{2Sa 12:1}  And the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said to him, "There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor.
{2Sa 12:1}  耶和华差遣拿单去见大卫。拿单到了大卫那里，对他说：“在一座城里有两个人：一个是富户，一个是穷人。
{2Sa 12:2}  The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
{2Sa 12:2}  富户有许多牛群羊群；
{2Sa 12:3}  but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children. It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him.
{2Sa 12:3}  穷人除了所买来养活的一只小母羊羔之外，别无所有。羊羔在他家里和他儿女一同长大，吃他所吃的，喝他所喝的，睡在他怀中，在他看来如同女儿一样。
{2Sa 12:4}  Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him."
{2Sa 12:4}  有一客人来到这富户家里；富户舍不得从自己的牛群羊群中取一只预备给客人吃，却取了那穷人的羊羔，预备给客人吃。”
{2Sa 12:5}  Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die,
{2Sa 12:5}  大卫就甚恼怒那人，对拿单说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，行这事的人该死！
{2Sa 12:6}  and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."
{2Sa 12:6}  他必偿还羊羔四倍；因为他行这事，没有怜恤的心。”
{2Sa 12:7}  Nathan said to David, "You are the man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
{2Sa 12:7}  拿单对大卫说：“你就是那人！耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘我膏你作以色列的王，救你脱离扫罗的手。
{2Sa 12:8}  And I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your arms and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And if this were too little, I would add to you as much more.
{2Sa 12:8}  我将你主人的家业赐给你，将你主人的妻交在你怀里，又将以色列和犹大家赐给你；你若还以为不足，我早就加倍地赐给你。
{2Sa 12:9}  Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
{2Sa 12:9}  你为什么藐视耶和华的命令，行他眼中看为恶的事呢？你借亚扪人的刀杀害赫人乌利亚，又娶了他的妻为妻。
{2Sa 12:10} Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.'
{2Sa 12:10} 你既藐视我，娶了赫人乌利亚的妻为妻，所以刀剑必永不离开你的家。’
{2Sa 12:11} Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house. And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
{2Sa 12:11} 耶和华如此说：‘我必从你家中兴起祸患攻击你；我必在你眼前把你的妃嫔赐给别人，他在日光之下就与他们同寝。
{2Sa 12:12} For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.'"
{2Sa 12:12} 你在暗中行这事，我却要在以色列众人面前，日光之下，报应你。’”
{2Sa 12:13} David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." And Nathan said to David, "The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.
{2Sa 12:13} 大卫对拿单说：“我得罪耶和华了！”拿单说：“耶和华已经除掉你的罪，你必不至于死。
{2Sa 12:14} Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the LORD, the child who is born to you shall die."
{2Sa 12:14} 只是你行这事，叫耶和华的仇敌大得亵渎的机会，故此，你所得的孩子必定要死。”
{2Sa 12:15} Then Nathan went to his house. And the LORD afflicted the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and he became sick.
{2Sa 12:15} 拿单就回家去了。耶和华击打乌利亚妻给大卫所生的孩子，使他得重病。
{2Sa 12:16} David therefore sought God on behalf of the child. And David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground.
{2Sa 12:16} 所以大卫为这孩子恳求神，而且禁食，进入内室，终夜躺在地上。
{2Sa 12:17} And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor did he eat food with them.
{2Sa 12:17} 他家中的老臣来到他旁边，要把他从地上扶起来，他却不肯起来，也不同他们吃饭。
{2Sa 12:18} On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, "Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. How then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm."
{2Sa 12:18} 到第七日，孩子死了。大卫的臣仆不敢告诉他孩子死了，因他们说：“孩子还活着的时候，我们劝他，他尚且不肯听我们的话，若告诉他孩子死了，岂不更加忧伤吗？”
{2Sa 12:19} But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, "Is the child dead?" They said, "He is dead."
{2Sa 12:19} 大卫见臣仆彼此低声说话，就知道孩子死了，问臣仆说：“孩子死了吗？”他们说：“死了。”
{2Sa 12:20} Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. He then went to his own house. And when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate.
{2Sa 12:20} 大卫就从地上起来，沐浴，抹膏，换了衣裳，进耶和华的殿敬拜；然后回宫，吩咐人摆饭，他便吃了。
{2Sa 12:21} Then his servants said to him, "What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food."
{2Sa 12:21} 臣仆问他说：“你所行的是什么意思？孩子活着的时候，你禁食哭泣；孩子死了，你倒起来吃饭。”
{2Sa 12:22} He said, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, 'Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?'
{2Sa 12:22} 大卫说：“孩子还活着，我禁食哭泣；因为我想，或者耶和华怜恤我，使孩子不死也未可知。
{2Sa 12:23} But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."
{2Sa 12:23} 孩子死了，我何必禁食，我岂能使他返回呢？我必往他那里去，他却不能回我这里来。”
{2Sa 12:24} Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her, and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him
{2Sa 12:24} 大卫安慰他的妻拔示巴，与他同寝，他就生了儿子，给他起名叫所罗门。耶和华也喜爱他，
{2Sa 12:25} and sent a message by Nathan the prophet. So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
{2Sa 12:25} 就藉先知拿单赐他一个名字，叫耶底底亚，因为耶和华爱他。
{2Sa 12:26} Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city.
{2Sa 12:26} 约押攻取亚扪人的京城拉巴。
{2Sa 12:27} And Joab sent messengers to David and said, "I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters.
{2Sa 12:27} 约押打发使者去见大卫，说：“我攻打拉巴，取其水城。
{2Sa 12:28} Now then gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called by my name."
{2Sa 12:28} 现在你要聚集其余的军兵来，安营围攻这城，恐怕我取了这城，人就以我的名叫这城。”
{2Sa 12:29} So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it.
{2Sa 12:29} 于是大卫聚集众军，往拉巴去攻城，就取了这城，
{2Sa 12:30} And he took the crown of their king from his head. The weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone, and it was placed on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
{2Sa 12:30} 夺了亚扪人之王所戴的金冠冕（王：或作玛勒堪；玛勒堪就是米勒公，又名摩洛，亚扪族之神名），其上的金子重一他连得，又嵌着宝石。人将这冠冕戴在大卫头上。大卫从城里夺了许多财物，
{2Sa 12:31} And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them toil at the brick kilns. And thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
{2Sa 12:31} 将城里的人拉出来，放在锯下，或铁耙下，或铁斧下，或叫他经过砖窑（或作：强他们用锯，或用打粮食的铁器，或用铁斧做工，或使在砖窑里服役）；大卫待亚扪各城的居民都是如此。其后，大卫和众军都回耶路撒冷去了。
{2Sa 13:1}  Now Absalom, David's son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar. And after a time Amnon, David's son, loved her.
{2Sa 13:1}  大卫的儿子押沙龙有一个美貌的妹子，名叫他玛。大卫的儿子暗嫩爱他。
{2Sa 13:2}  And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.
{2Sa 13:2}  暗嫩为他妹子他玛忧急成病。他玛还是处女，暗嫩以为难向他行事。
{2Sa 13:3}  But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man.
{2Sa 13:3}  暗嫩有一个朋友，名叫约拿达，是大卫长兄示米亚的儿子。这约拿达为人极其狡猾；
{2Sa 13:4}  And he said to him, "O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
{2Sa 13:4}  他问暗嫩说：“王的儿子啊，为何一天比一天瘦弱呢？请你告诉我。”暗嫩回答说：“我爱我兄弟押沙龙的妹子他玛。”
{2Sa 13:5}  Jonadab said to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.'"
{2Sa 13:5}  约拿达说：“你不如躺在床上装病；你父亲来看你，就对他说：‘求父叫我妹子他玛来，在我眼前预备食物，递给我吃，使我看见，好从他手里接过来吃。’”
{2Sa 13:6}  So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."
{2Sa 13:6}  于是暗嫩躺卧装病。王来看他，他对王说：“求父叫我妹子他玛来，在我眼前为我做两个饼，我好从他手里接过来吃。”
{2Sa 13:7}  Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, "Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him."
{2Sa 13:7}  大卫就打发人到宫里，对他玛说：“你往你哥哥暗嫩的屋里去，为他预备食物。”
{2Sa 13:8}  So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.
{2Sa 13:8}  他玛就到他哥哥暗嫩的屋里；暗嫩正躺卧。他玛抟面，在他眼前做饼，且烤熟了，
{2Sa 13:9}  And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, "Send out everyone from me." So everyone went out from him.
{2Sa 13:9}  在他面前将饼从锅里倒出来，他却不肯吃，便说：“众人离开我出去吧！”众人就都离开他，出去了。
{2Sa 13:10} Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand." And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
{2Sa 13:10} 暗嫩对他玛说：“你把食物拿进卧房，我好从你手里接过来吃。”他玛就把所做的饼拿进卧房，到他哥哥暗嫩那里，
{2Sa 13:11} But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister."
{2Sa 13:11} 拿着饼上前给他吃，他便拉住他玛，说：“我妹妹，你来与我同寝。”
{2Sa 13:12} She answered him, "No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this outrageous thing.
{2Sa 13:12} 他玛说：“我哥哥，不要玷辱我。以色列人中不当这样行，你不要做这丑事；
{2Sa 13:13} As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the outrageous fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you."
{2Sa 13:13} 你玷辱了我，我何以掩盖我的羞耻呢？你在以色列中也成了愚妄人。你可以求王，他必不禁止我归你。”
{2Sa 13:14} But he would not listen to her, and being stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.
{2Sa 13:14} 但暗嫩不肯听他的话，因比他力大，就玷辱他，与他同寝。
{2Sa 13:15} Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, "Get up! Go!"
{2Sa 13:15} 随后，暗嫩极其恨他，那恨他的心比先前爱他的心更甚，对他说：“你起来，去吧！”
{2Sa 13:16} But she said to him, "No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me." But he would not listen to her.
{2Sa 13:16} 他玛说：“不要这样！你赶出我去的这罪比你才行的更重！”但暗嫩不肯听他的话，
{2Sa 13:17} He called the young man who served him and said, "Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her."
{2Sa 13:17} 就叫伺候自己的仆人来，说：“将这个女子赶出去！他一出去，你就关门，上闩。”
{2Sa 13:18} Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves, for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her.
{2Sa 13:18} 那时他玛穿着彩衣，因为没有出嫁的公主都是这样穿。暗嫩的仆人就把他赶出去，关门上闩。
{2Sa 13:19} And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she wore. And she laid her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.
{2Sa 13:19} 他玛把灰尘撒在头上，撕裂所穿的彩衣，以手抱头，一面行走，一面哭喊。
{2Sa 13:20} And her brother Absalom said to her, "Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this to heart." So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom's house.
{2Sa 13:20} 他胞兄押沙龙问他说：“莫非你哥哥暗嫩与你亲近了吗？我妹妹，暂且不要作声，他是你的哥哥，不要将这事放在心上。”他玛就孤孤单单地住在他胞兄押沙龙家里。
{2Sa 13:21} When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
{2Sa 13:21} 大卫王听见这事，就甚发怒。
{2Sa 13:22} But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had violated his sister Tamar.
{2Sa 13:22} 押沙龙并不和他哥哥暗嫩说好说歹；因为暗嫩玷辱他妹妹他玛，所以押沙龙恨恶他。
{2Sa 13:23} After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
{2Sa 13:23} 过了二年，在靠近以法莲的巴力夏琐有人为押沙龙剪羊毛；押沙龙请王的众子与他同去。
{2Sa 13:24} And Absalom came to the king and said, "Behold, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant."
{2Sa 13:24} 押沙龙来见王，说：“现在有人为仆人剪羊毛，请王和王的臣仆与仆人同去。”
{2Sa 13:25} But the king said to Absalom, "No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you." He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing.
{2Sa 13:25} 王对押沙龙说：“我儿，我们不必都去，恐怕使你耗费太多。”押沙龙再三请王，王仍是不肯去，只为他祝福。
{2Sa 13:26} Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us." And the king said to him, "Why should he go with you?"
{2Sa 13:26} 押沙龙说：“王若不去，求王许我哥哥暗嫩同去。”王说：“何必要他去呢？”
{2Sa 13:27} But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
{2Sa 13:27} 押沙龙再三求王，王就许暗嫩和王的众子与他同去。
{2Sa 13:28} Then Absalom commanded his servants, "Mark when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, 'Strike Amnon,' then kill him. Do not fear; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant."
{2Sa 13:28} 押沙龙吩咐仆人说：“你们注意，看暗嫩饮酒畅快的时候，我对你们说杀暗嫩，你们便杀他，不要惧怕。这不是我吩咐你们的吗？你们只管壮胆奋勇！”
{2Sa 13:29} So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.
{2Sa 13:29} 押沙龙的仆人就照押沙龙所吩咐的，向暗嫩行了。王的众子都起来，各人骑上骡子，逃跑了。
{2Sa 13:30} While they were on the way, news came to David, "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons, and not one of them is left."
{2Sa 13:30} 他们还在路上，有风声传到大卫那里，说：“押沙龙将王的众子都杀了，没有留下一个。”
{2Sa 13:31} Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth. And all his servants who were standing by tore their garments.
{2Sa 13:31} 王就起来，撕裂衣服，躺在地上。王的臣仆也都撕裂衣服，站在旁边。
{2Sa 13:32} But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, "Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king's sons, for Amnon alone is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar.
{2Sa 13:32} 大卫的长兄，示米亚的儿子约拿达说：“我主，不要以为王的众子少年人都杀了，只有暗嫩一个人死了。自从暗嫩玷辱押沙龙妹子他玛的那日，押沙龙就定意杀暗嫩了。
{2Sa 13:33} Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king's sons are dead, for Amnon alone is dead."
{2Sa 13:33} 现在，我主我王，不要把这事放在心上，以为王的众子都死了，只有暗嫩一个人死了。”
{2Sa 13:34} But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.
{2Sa 13:34} 押沙龙逃跑了。守望的少年人举目观看，见有许多人从山坡的路上来。
{2Sa 13:35} And Jonadab said to the king, "Behold, the king's sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about."
{2Sa 13:35} 约拿达对王说：“看哪，王的众子都来了，果然与你仆人所说的相合。”
{2Sa 13:36} And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king's sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.
{2Sa 13:36} 话才说完，王的众子都到了，放声大哭；王和臣仆也都哭得甚恸。
{2Sa 13:37} But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day.
{2Sa 13:37} 押沙龙逃到基述王亚米忽的儿子达买那里去了。大卫天天为他儿子悲哀。
{2Sa 13:38} So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
{2Sa 13:38} 押沙龙逃到基述，在那里住了三年。
{2Sa 13:39} And the spirit of the king longed to go out to Absalom, because he was comforted about Amnon, since he was dead.
{2Sa 13:39} 暗嫩死了以后，大卫王得了安慰，心里切切想念押沙龙。
{2Sa 14:1}  Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king's heart went out to Absalom.
{2Sa 14:1}  洗鲁雅的儿子约押，知道王心里想念押沙龙，
{2Sa 14:2}  And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman and said to her, "Pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning garments. Do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead.
{2Sa 14:2}  就打发人往提哥亚去，从那里叫了一个聪明的妇人来，对他说：“请你假装居丧的，穿上孝衣，不要用膏抹身，要装作为死者许久悲哀的妇人；
{2Sa 14:3}  Go to the king and speak thus to him." So Joab put the words in her mouth.
{2Sa 14:3}  进去见王，对王如此如此说。”于是约押将当说的话教导了妇人。
{2Sa 14:4}  When the woman of Tekoa came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and paid homage and said, "Save me, O king."
{2Sa 14:4}  提哥亚妇人到王面前，伏地叩拜，说：“王啊，求你拯救！”
{2Sa 14:5}  And the king said to her, "What is your trouble?" She answered, "Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead.
{2Sa 14:5}  王问他说：“你有什么事呢？”回答说：“婢女实在是寡妇，我丈夫死了。
{2Sa 14:6}  And your servant had two sons, and they quarreled with one another in the field. There was no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him.
{2Sa 14:6}  我有两个儿子，一日在田间争斗，没有人解劝，这个就打死那个。
{2Sa 14:7}  And now the whole clan has risen against your servant, and they say, 'Give up the man who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed.' And so they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal that is left and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth."
{2Sa 14:7}  现在全家的人都起来攻击婢女，说：‘你将那打死兄弟的交出来，我们好治死他，偿他打死兄弟的命，灭绝那承受家业的。’这样，他们要将我剩下的炭火灭尽，不与我丈夫留名留后在世上。”
{2Sa 14:8}  Then the king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you."
{2Sa 14:8}  王对妇人说：“你回家去吧！我必为你下令。”
{2Sa 14:9}  And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, "On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father's house; let the king and his throne be guiltless."
{2Sa 14:9}  提哥亚妇人又对王说：“我主我王，愿这罪归我和我父家，与王和王的位无干。”
{2Sa 14:10} The king said, "If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again."
{2Sa 14:10} 王说：“凡难为你的，你就带他到我这里来，他必不再搅扰你。”
{2Sa 14:11} Then she said, "Please let the king invoke the LORD your God, that the avenger of blood kill no more, and my son be not destroyed." He said, "As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground."
{2Sa 14:11} 妇人说：“愿王记念耶和华你的神，不许报血仇的人施行灭绝，恐怕他们灭绝我的儿子。”王说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓：你的儿子连一根头发也不至落在地上。”
{2Sa 14:12} Then the woman said, "Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king." He said, "Speak."
{2Sa 14:12} 妇人说：“求我主我王容婢女再说一句话。”王说：“你说吧！”
{2Sa 14:13} And the woman said, "Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again.
{2Sa 14:13} 妇人说：“王为何也起意要害神的民呢？王不使那逃亡的人回来，王的这话就是自证己错了！
{2Sa 14:14} We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God will not take away life, and he devises means so that the banished one will not remain an outcast.
{2Sa 14:14} 我们都是必死的，如同水泼在地上，不能收回。神并不夺取人的性命，乃设法使逃亡的人不至成为赶出、回不来的。
{2Sa 14:15} Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid, and your servant thought, 'I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
{2Sa 14:15} 我来将这话告诉我主我王，是因百姓使我惧怕。婢女想，不如将这话告诉王，或者王成就婢女所求的。
{2Sa 14:16} For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God.'
{2Sa 14:16} 人要将我和我儿子从神的地业上一同除灭，王必应允救我脱离他的手。
{2Sa 14:17} And your servant thought, 'The word of my lord the king will set me at rest,' for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil. The LORD your God be with you!"
{2Sa 14:17} 婢女又想，我主我王的话必安慰我；因为我主我王能辨别是非，如同神的使者一样。惟愿耶和华你的神与你同在！”
{2Sa 14:18} Then the king answered the woman, "Do not hide from me anything I ask you." And the woman said, "Let my lord the king speak."
{2Sa 14:18} 王对妇人说：“我要问你一句话，你一点不要瞒我。”妇人说：“愿我主我王说。”
{2Sa 14:19} The king said, "Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?" The woman answered and said, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant.
{2Sa 14:19} 王说：“你这些话莫非是约押的主意吗？”妇人说：“我敢在我主我王面前起誓：王的话正对，不偏左右，是王的仆人约押吩咐我的，这些话是他教导我的。
{2Sa 14:20} In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth."
{2Sa 14:20} 王的仆人约押如此行，为要挽回这事。我主的智慧却如神使者的智慧，能知世上一切事。”
{2Sa 14:21} Then the king said to Joab, "Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom."
{2Sa 14:21} 王对约押说：“我应允你这事。你可以去，把那少年人押沙龙带回来。”
{2Sa 14:22} And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king. And Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant."
{2Sa 14:22} 约押就面伏于地叩拜，祝谢于王，又说：“王既应允仆人所求的，仆人今日知道在我主我王眼前蒙恩了。”
{2Sa 14:23} So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
{2Sa 14:23} 于是约押起身往基述去，将押沙龙带回耶路撒冷。
{2Sa 14:24} And the king said, "Let him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence." So Absalom lived apart in his own house and did not come into the king's presence.
{2Sa 14:24} 王说：“使他回自己家里去，不要见我的面。”押沙龙就回自己家里去，没有见王的面。
{2Sa 14:25} Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
{2Sa 14:25} 以色列全地之中，无人像押沙龙那样俊美，得人的称赞，从脚底到头顶毫无瑕疵。
{2Sa 14:26} And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king's weight.
{2Sa 14:26} 他的头发甚重，每到年底剪发一次；所剪下来的，按王的平称一称，重二百舍客勒。
{2Sa 14:27} There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a beautiful woman.
{2Sa 14:27} 押沙龙生了三个儿子，一个女儿。女儿名叫他玛，是个容貌俊美的女子。
{2Sa 14:28} So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king's presence.
{2Sa 14:28} 押沙龙住在耶路撒冷足有二年，没有见王的面。
{2Sa 14:29} Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Joab would not come.
{2Sa 14:29} 押沙龙打发人去叫约押来，要托他去见王，约押却不肯来。第二次打发人去叫他，他仍不肯来。
{2Sa 14:30} Then he said to his servants, "See, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
{2Sa 14:30} 所以押沙龙对仆人说：“你们看，约押有一块田，与我的田相近，其中有大麦，你们去放火烧了。”押沙龙的仆人就去放火烧了那田。
{2Sa 14:31} Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
{2Sa 14:31} 于是约押起来，到了押沙龙家里，问他说：“你的仆人为何放火烧了我的田呢？”
{2Sa 14:32} Absalom answered Joab, "Behold, I sent word to you, 'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still." Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.'"
{2Sa 14:32} 押沙龙回答约押说：“我打发人去请你来，好托你去见王，替我说：‘我为何从基述回来呢？不如仍在那里。’现在要许我见王的面；我若有罪，任凭王杀我就是了。”
{2Sa 14:33} Then Joab went to the king and told him, and he summoned Absalom. So he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.
{2Sa 14:33} 于是约押去见王，将这话奏告王，王便叫押沙龙来。押沙龙来见王，在王面前俯伏于地，王就与押沙龙亲嘴。
{2Sa 15:1}  After this Absalom got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
{2Sa 15:1}  此后，押沙龙为自己预备车马，又派五十人在他前头奔走。
{2Sa 15:2}  And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way of the gate. And when any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, "From what city are you?" And when he said, "Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,"
{2Sa 15:2}  押沙龙常常早晨起来，站在城门的道旁，凡有争讼要去求王判断的，押沙龙就叫他过来，问他说：“你是那一城的人？”回答说：“仆人是以色列某支派的人。”
{2Sa 15:3}  Absalom would say to him, "See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man designated by the king to hear you."
{2Sa 15:3}  押沙龙对他说：“你的事有情有理，无奈王没有委人听你伸诉。”
{2Sa 15:4}  Then Absalom would say, "Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice."
{2Sa 15:4}  押沙龙又说：“恨不得我作国中的士师！凡有争讼求审判的到我这里来，我必秉公判断。”
{2Sa 15:5}  And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.
{2Sa 15:5}  若有人近前来要拜押沙龙，押沙龙就伸手拉住他，与他亲嘴。
{2Sa 15:6}  Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
{2Sa 15:6}  以色列人中，凡去见王求判断的，押沙龙都是如此待他们。这样，押沙龙暗中得了以色列人的心。
{2Sa 15:7}  And at the end of four years Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.
{2Sa 15:7}  满了四十年（有作四年的），押沙龙对王说：“求你准我往希伯仑去，还我向耶和华所许的愿。
{2Sa 15:8}  For your servant vowed a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram, saying, 'If the LORD will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will offer worship to the LORD.'"
{2Sa 15:8}  因为仆人住在亚兰的基述，曾许愿说：‘耶和华若使我再回耶路撒冷，我必事奉他。’”
{2Sa 15:9}  The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he arose and went to Hebron.
{2Sa 15:9}  王说：“你平平安安的去吧！”押沙龙就起身，往希伯仑去了。
{2Sa 15:10} But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, 'Absalom is king at Hebron!'"
{2Sa 15:10} 押沙龙打发探子走遍以色列各支派，说：“你们一听见角声就说：‘押沙龙在希伯仑作王了！’”
{2Sa 15:11} With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their innocence and knew nothing.
{2Sa 15:11} 押沙龙在耶路撒冷请了二百人与他同去，都是诚诚实实去的，并不知道其中的真情。
{2Sa 15:12} And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city Giloh. And the conspiracy grew strong, and the people with Absalom kept increasing.
{2Sa 15:12} 押沙龙献祭的时候，打发人去将大卫的谋士、基罗人亚希多弗从他本城请了来。于是叛逆的势派甚大；因为随从押沙龙的人民，日渐增多。
{2Sa 15:13} And a messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom."
{2Sa 15:13} 有人报告大卫说：“以色列人的心都归向押沙龙了！”
{2Sa 15:14} Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise, and let us flee, or else there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Go quickly, lest he overtake us quickly and bring down ruin on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword."
{2Sa 15:14} 大卫就对耶路撒冷跟随他的臣仆说：“我们要起来逃走，不然都不能躲避押沙龙了；要速速地去，恐怕他忽然来到，加害于我们，用刀杀尽合城的人。”
{2Sa 15:15} And the king's servants said to the king, "Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides."
{2Sa 15:15} 王的臣仆对王说：“我主我王所定的，仆人都愿遵行。”
{2Sa 15:16} So the king went out, and all his household after him. And the king left ten concubines to keep the house.
{2Sa 15:16} 于是王带着全家的人出去了，但留下十个妃嫔看守宫殿。
{2Sa 15:17} And the king went out, and all the people after him. And they halted at the last house.
{2Sa 15:17} 王出去，众民都跟随他，到伯墨哈，就住下了。
{2Sa 15:18} And all his servants passed by him, and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king.
{2Sa 15:18} 王的臣仆都在他面前过去。基利提人、比利提人，就是从迦特跟随王来的六百人，也都在他面前过去。
{2Sa 15:19} Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why do you also go with us? Go back and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your home.
{2Sa 15:19} 王对迦特人以太说：“你是外邦逃来的人，为什么与我们同去呢？你可以回去与新王同住，或者回你本地去吧！
{2Sa 15:20} You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, since I go I know not where? Go back and take your brothers with you, and may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you."
{2Sa 15:20} 你来的日子不多，我今日怎好叫你与我们一同飘流、没有一定的住处呢？你不如带你的弟兄回去吧！愿耶和华用慈爱诚实待你。”
{2Sa 15:21} But Ittai answered the king, "As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, there also will your servant be."
{2Sa 15:21} 以太对王说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，又敢在王面前起誓：无论生死，王在那里，仆人也必在那里。”
{2Sa 15:22} And David said to Ittai, "Go then, pass on." So Ittai the Gittite passed on with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.
{2Sa 15:22} 大卫对以太说：“你前去过河吧！”于是迦特人以太带着跟随他的人和所有的妇人孩子，就都过去了。
{2Sa 15:23} And all the land wept aloud as all the people passed by, and the king crossed the brook Kidron, and all the people passed on toward the wilderness.
{2Sa 15:23} 本地的人都放声大哭。众民尽都过去，王也过了汲沦溪；众民往旷野去了。
{2Sa 15:24} And Abiathar came up, and behold, Zadok came also with all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God until the people had all passed out of the city.
{2Sa 15:24} 撒督和抬神约柜的利未人也一同来了，将神的约柜放下。亚比亚他上来，等着众民从城里出来过去。
{2Sa 15:25} Then the king said to Zadok, "Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me back and let me see both it and his dwelling place.
{2Sa 15:25} 王对撒督说：“你将神的约柜抬回城去。我若在耶和华眼前蒙恩，他必使我回来，再见约柜和他的居所。
{2Sa 15:26} But if he says, 'I have no pleasure in you,' behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him."
{2Sa 15:26} 倘若他说：‘我不喜悦你’，看哪，我在这里，愿他凭自己的意旨待我！”
{2Sa 15:27} The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Are you not a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
{2Sa 15:27} 王又对祭司撒督说：“你不是先见吗？你可以安然回城；你儿子亚希玛斯和亚比亚他的儿子约拿单都可以与你同去。
{2Sa 15:28} See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me."
{2Sa 15:28} 我在旷野的渡口那里等你们报信给我。”
{2Sa 15:29} So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.
{2Sa 15:29} 于是撒督和亚比亚他将神的约柜抬回耶路撒冷，他们就住在那里。
{2Sa 15:30} But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered. And all the people who were with him covered their heads, and they went up, weeping as they went.
{2Sa 15:30} 大卫蒙头赤脚上橄榄山，一面上一面哭。跟随他的人也都蒙头哭着上去；
{2Sa 15:31} And it was told David, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." And David said, "O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."
{2Sa 15:31} 有人告诉大卫说：“亚希多弗也在叛党之中，随从押沙龙。”大卫祷告说：“耶和华啊，求你使亚希多弗的计谋变为愚拙！”
{2Sa 15:32} While David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and dirt on his head.
{2Sa 15:32} 大卫到了山顶、敬拜神的地方，见亚基人户筛，衣服撕裂，头蒙灰尘来迎接他。
{2Sa 15:33} David said to him, "If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.
{2Sa 15:33} 大卫对他说：“你若与我同去，必累赘我；
{2Sa 15:34} But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,' then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
{2Sa 15:34} 你若回城去，对押沙龙说：‘王啊，我愿作你的仆人；我向来作你父亲的仆人，现在我也照样作你的仆人。’这样，你就可以为我破坏亚希多弗的计谋。
{2Sa 15:35} Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So whatever you hear from the king's house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
{2Sa 15:35} 祭司撒督和亚比亚他岂不都在那里吗？你在王宫里听见什么，就要告诉祭司撒督和亚比亚他。
{2Sa 15:36} Behold, their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son, and by them you shall send to me everything you hear."
{2Sa 15:36} 撒督的儿子亚希玛斯，亚比亚他的儿子约拿单，也都在那里。凡你们所听见的可以托这二人来报告我。”
{2Sa 15:37} So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
{2Sa 15:37} 于是，大卫的朋友户筛进了城；押沙龙也进了耶路撒冷。
{2Sa 16:1}  When David had passed a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, bearing two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred of summer fruits, and a skin of wine.
{2Sa 16:1}  大卫刚过山顶，见米非波设的仆人洗巴拉着备好了的两匹驴，驴上驮着二百面饼，一百葡萄饼，一百个夏天的果饼，一皮袋酒来迎接他。
{2Sa 16:2}  And the king said to Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who faint in the wilderness to drink."
{2Sa 16:2}  王问洗巴说：“你带这些来是什么意思呢？”洗巴说：“驴是给王的家眷骑的；面饼和夏天的果饼是给少年人吃的；酒是给在旷野疲乏人喝的。”
{2Sa 16:3}  And the king said, "And where is your master's son?" Ziba said to the king, "Behold, he remains in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father.'"
{2Sa 16:3}  王问说：“你主人的儿子在那里呢？”洗巴回答王说：“他仍在耶路撒冷，因他说：‘以色列人今日必将我父的国归还我。’”
{2Sa 16:4}  Then the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours." And Ziba said, "I pay homage; let me ever find favor in your sight, my lord the king."
{2Sa 16:4}  王对洗巴说：“凡属米非波设的都归你了。”洗巴说：“我叩拜我主我王，愿我在你眼前蒙恩。”
{2Sa 16:5}  When King David came to Bahurim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera, and as he came he cursed continually.
{2Sa 16:5}  大卫王到了巴户琳，见有一个人出来，是扫罗族基拉的儿子，名叫示每。他一面走一面咒骂，
{2Sa 16:6}  And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
{2Sa 16:6}  又拿石头砍大卫王和王的臣仆；众民和勇士都在王的左右。
{2Sa 16:7}  And Shimei said as he cursed, "Get out, get out, you man of blood, you worthless man!
{2Sa 16:7}  示每咒骂说：“你这流人血的坏人哪，去吧去吧！
{2Sa 16:8}  The LORD has avenged on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, your evil is on you, for you are a man of blood."
{2Sa 16:8}  你流扫罗全家的血，接续他作王；耶和华把这罪归在你身上，将这国交给你儿子押沙龙。现在你自取其祸，因为你是流人血的人。”
{2Sa 16:9}  Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head."
{2Sa 16:9}  洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛对王说：“这死狗岂可咒骂我主我王呢？求你容我过去，割下他的头来。”
{2Sa 16:10} But the king said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him, 'Curse David,' who then shall say, 'Why have you done so?'"
{2Sa 16:10} 王说：“洗鲁雅的儿子，我与你们有何关涉呢？他咒骂是因耶和华吩咐他说：‘你要咒骂大卫。’如此，谁敢说你为什么这样行呢？”
{2Sa 16:11} And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Leave him alone, and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.
{2Sa 16:11} 大卫又对亚比筛和众臣仆说：“我亲生的儿子尚且寻索我的性命，何况这便雅悯人呢？由他咒骂吧！因为这是耶和华吩咐他的。
{2Sa 16:12} It may be that the LORD will look on the wrong done to me, and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing today."
{2Sa 16:12} 或者耶和华见我遭难，为我今日被这人咒骂，就施恩与我。”
{2Sa 16:13} So David and his men went on the road, while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and flung dust.
{2Sa 16:13} 于是大卫和跟随他的人往前行走。示每在大卫对面山坡，一面行走一面咒骂，又拿石头砍他，拿土扬他。
{2Sa 16:14} And the king, and all the people who were with him, arrived weary at the Jordan. And there he refreshed himself.
{2Sa 16:14} 王和跟随他的众人疲疲乏乏地到了一个地方，就在那里歇息歇息。
{2Sa 16:15} Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
{2Sa 16:15} 押沙龙和以色列众人来到耶路撒冷；亚希多弗也与他同来。
{2Sa 16:16} And when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"
{2Sa 16:16} 大卫的朋友亚基人户筛去见押沙龙，对他说：“愿王万岁！愿王万岁！”
{2Sa 16:17} And Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?"
{2Sa 16:17} 押沙龙问户筛说：“这是你恩待朋友吗？为什么不与你的朋友同去呢？”
{2Sa 16:18} And Hushai said to Absalom, "No, for whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain.
{2Sa 16:18} 户筛对押沙龙说：“不然，耶和华和这民，并以色列众人所拣选的，我必归顺他，与他同住。
{2Sa 16:19} And again, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father, so I will serve you."
{2Sa 16:19} 再者，我当服事谁呢？岂不是前王的儿子吗？我怎样服事你父亲，也必照样服事你。”
{2Sa 16:20} Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give your counsel. What shall we do?"
{2Sa 16:20} 押沙龙对亚希多弗说：“你们出个主意，我们怎样行才好？”
{2Sa 16:21} Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go in to your father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened."
{2Sa 16:21} 亚希多弗对押沙龙说：“你父所留下看守宫殿的妃嫔，你可以与他们亲近。以色列众人听见你父亲憎恶你，凡归顺你人的手就更坚强。”
{2Sa 16:22} So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof. And Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
{2Sa 16:22} 于是人为押沙龙在宫殿的平顶上支搭帐棚；押沙龙在以色列众人眼前，与他父的妃嫔亲近。
{2Sa 16:23} Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed, both by David and by Absalom.
{2Sa 16:23} 那时亚希多弗所出的主意好像人问神的话一样；他昔日给大卫，今日给押沙龙所出的主意，都是这样。
{2Sa 17:1}  Moreover, Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight.
{2Sa 17:1}  亚希多弗又对押沙龙说：“求你准我挑选一万二千人，今夜我就起身追赶大卫，
{2Sa 17:2}  I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged and throw him into a panic, and all the people who are with him will flee. I will strike down only the king,
{2Sa 17:2}  趁他疲乏手软，我忽然追上他，使他惊惶；跟随他的民必都逃跑，我就单杀王一人，
{2Sa 17:3}  and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband. You seek the life of only one man, and all the people will be at peace."
{2Sa 17:3}  使众民都归顺你。你所寻找的人既然死了，众民就如已经归顺你；这样，也都平安无事了。”
{2Sa 17:4}  And the advice seemed right in the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
{2Sa 17:4}  押沙龙和以色列的长老都以这话为美。
{2Sa 17:5}  Then Absalom said, "Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say."
{2Sa 17:5}  押沙龙说：“要召亚基人户筛来，我们也要听他怎样说。”
{2Sa 17:6}  And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, "Thus has Ahithophel spoken; shall we do as he says? If not, you speak."
{2Sa 17:6}  户筛到了押沙龙面前，押沙龙向他说：“亚希多弗是如此如此说的，我们照着他的话行可以不可以？若不可，你就说吧！”
{2Sa 17:7}  Then Hushai said to Absalom, "This time the counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good."
{2Sa 17:7}  户筛对押沙龙说：“亚希多弗这次所定的谋不善。”
{2Sa 17:8}  Hushai said, "You know that your father and his men are mighty men, and that they are enraged, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Besides, your father is expert in war; he will not spend the night with the people.
{2Sa 17:8}  户筛又说：“你知道，你父亲和跟随他的人都是勇士，现在他们心里恼怒，如同田野丢崽子的母熊一般，而且你父亲是个战士，必不和民一同住宿。
{2Sa 17:9}  Behold, even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits or in some other place. And as soon as some of the people fall at the first attack, whoever hears it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.'
{2Sa 17:9}  他现今或藏在坑中或在别处，若有人首先被杀，凡听见的必说：‘跟随押沙龙的民被杀了。’
{2Sa 17:10} Then even the valiant man, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and that those who are with him are valiant men.
{2Sa 17:10} 虽有人胆大如狮子，他的心也必消化；因为以色列人都知道你父亲是英雄，跟随他的人也都是勇士。
{2Sa 17:11} But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as the sand by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person.
{2Sa 17:11} 依我之计，不如将以色列众人从但直到别是巴，如同海边的沙那样多聚集到你这里来，你也亲自率领他们出战。
{2Sa 17:12} So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found, and we shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground, and of him and all the men with him not one will be left.
{2Sa 17:12} 这样，我们在何处遇见他，就下到他那里，如同露水下在地上一般，连他带跟随他的人，一个也不留下。
{2Sa 17:13} If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we shall drag it into the valley, until not even a pebble is to be found there."
{2Sa 17:13} 他若进了哪一座城，以色列众人必带绳子去，将那城拉到河里，甚至连一块小石头都不剩下。”
{2Sa 17:14} And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel." For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the LORD might bring harm upon Absalom.
{2Sa 17:14} 押沙龙和以色列众人说：“亚基人户筛的计谋比亚希多弗的计谋更好！”这是因耶和华定意破坏亚希多弗的良谋，为要降祸与押沙龙。
{2Sa 17:15} Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, "Thus and so did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so have I counseled.
{2Sa 17:15} 户筛对祭司撒督和亚比亚他说：“亚希多弗为押沙龙和以色列的长老所定的计谋是如此如此，我所定的计谋是如此如此。
{2Sa 17:16} Now therefore send quickly and tell David, 'Do not stay tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.'"
{2Sa 17:16} 现在你们要急速打发人去，告诉大卫说：‘今夜不可住在旷野的渡口，务要过河，免得王和跟随他的人都被吞灭。’”
{2Sa 17:17} Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En-rogel. A female servant was to go and tell them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they were not to be seen entering the city.
{2Sa 17:17} 那时，约拿单和亚希玛斯在隐罗结那里等候，不敢进城，恐怕被人看见。有一个使女出来，将这话告诉他们，他们就去报信给大卫王。
{2Sa 17:18} But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So both of them went away quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard. And they went down into it.
{2Sa 17:18} 然而有一个童子看见他们，就去告诉押沙龙。他们急忙跑到巴户琳某人的家里；那人院中有一口井，他们就下到井里。
{2Sa 17:19} And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth and scattered grain on it, and nothing was known of it.
{2Sa 17:19} 那家的妇人用盖盖上井口，又在上头铺上碎麦，事就没有泄漏。
{2Sa 17:20} When Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house, they said, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" And the woman said to them, "They have gone over the brook of water." And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
{2Sa 17:20} 押沙龙的仆人来到那家，问妇人说：“亚希玛斯和约拿单在那里？”妇人说：“他们过了河了。”仆人找他们，找不着，就回耶路撒冷去了。
{2Sa 17:21} After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, "Arise, and go quickly over the water, for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you."
{2Sa 17:21} 他们走后，二人从井里上来，去告诉大卫王说：“亚希多弗如此如此定计害你，你们务要起来，快快过河。”
{2Sa 17:22} Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan. By daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.
{2Sa 17:22} 于是大卫和跟随他的人都起来，过约但河。到了天亮，无一人不过约但河的。
{2Sa 17:23} When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and went off home to his own city. He set his house in order and hanged himself, and he died and was buried in the tomb of his father.
{2Sa 17:23} 亚希多弗见不依从他的计谋，就备上驴，归回本城；到了家，留下遗言，便吊死了，葬在他父亲的坟墓里。
{2Sa 17:24} Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.
{2Sa 17:24} 大卫到了玛哈念，押沙龙和跟随他的以色列人也都过了约但河。
{2Sa 17:25} Now Absalom had set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had married Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
{2Sa 17:25} 押沙龙立亚玛撒作元帅，代替约押。亚玛撒是以实玛利人（又作以色列人）以特拉的儿子。以特拉曾与拿辖的女儿亚比该亲近；这亚比该与约押的母亲洗鲁雅是姊妹。
{2Sa 17:26} And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
{2Sa 17:26} 押沙龙和以色列人都安营在基列地。
{2Sa 17:27} When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,
{2Sa 17:27} 大卫到了玛哈念，亚扪族的拉巴人拿辖的儿子朔比，罗底巴人亚米利的儿子玛吉，基列的罗基琳人巴西莱，
{2Sa 17:28} brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans and lentils,
{2Sa 17:28} 带着被、褥、盆、碗、瓦器、小麦、大麦、麦面、炒谷、豆子、红豆、炒豆、
{2Sa 17:29} honey and curds and sheep and cheese from the herd, for David and the people with him to eat, for they said, "The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness."
{2Sa 17:29} 蜂蜜、奶油、绵羊、奶饼，供给大卫和跟随他的人吃；他们说：“民在旷野，必饥渴困乏了。”
{2Sa 18:1}  Then David mustered the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
{2Sa 18:1}  大卫数点跟随他的人，立千夫长、百夫长率领他们。
{2Sa 18:2}  And David sent out the army, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the men, "I myself will also go out with you."
{2Sa 18:2}  大卫打发军兵出战，分为三队：一队在约押手下，一队在洗鲁雅的儿子、约押兄弟亚比筛手下，一队在迦特人以太手下。大卫对军兵说：“我必与你们一同出战。”
{2Sa 18:3}  But the men said, "You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city."
{2Sa 18:3}  军兵却说：“你不可出战。若是我们逃跑，敌人必不介意；我们阵亡一半，敌人也不介意。因为你一人强似我们万人，你不如在城里预备帮助我们。”
{2Sa 18:4}  The king said to them, "Whatever seems best to you I will do." So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands.
{2Sa 18:4}  王向他们说：“你们以为怎样好，我就怎样行。”于是王站在城门旁，军兵或百或千地挨次出去了。
{2Sa 18:5}  And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom." And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom.
{2Sa 18:5}  王嘱咐约押、亚比筛、以太说：“你们要为我的缘故宽待那少年人押沙龙。”王为押沙龙嘱咐众将的话，兵都听见了。
{2Sa 18:6}  So the army went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.
{2Sa 18:6}  兵就出到田野迎着以色列人，在以法莲树林里交战。
{2Sa 18:7}  And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the loss there was great on that day, twenty thousand men.
{2Sa 18:7}  以色列人败在大卫的仆人面前；那日阵亡的甚多，共有二万人。
{2Sa 18:8}  The battle spread over the face of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword.
{2Sa 18:8}  因为在那里四面打仗，死于树林的比死于刀剑的更多。
{2Sa 18:9}  And Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak, and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on.
{2Sa 18:9}  押沙龙偶然遇见大卫的仆人。押沙龙骑着骡子，从大橡树密枝底下经过，他的头发被树枝绕住，就悬挂起来，所骑的骡子便离他去了。
{2Sa 18:10} And a certain man saw it and told Joab, "Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak."
{2Sa 18:10} 有个人看见，就告诉约押说：“我看见押沙龙挂在橡树上了。”
{2Sa 18:11} Joab said to the man who told him, "What, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt."
{2Sa 18:11} 约押对报信的人说：“你既看见他，为什么不将他打死落在地上呢？你若打死他，我就赏你十舍客勒银子，一条带子。”
{2Sa 18:12} But the man said to Joab, "Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not reach out my hand against the king's son, for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake protect the young man Absalom.'
{2Sa 18:12} 那人对约押说：“我就是得你一千舍客勒银子，我也不敢伸手害王的儿子；因为我们听见王嘱咐你和亚比筛并以太说：‘你们要谨慎，不可害那少年人押沙龙。’
{2Sa 18:13} On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof."
{2Sa 18:13} 我若妄为害了他的性命，就是你自己也必与我为敌（原来，无论何事都瞒不过王。）”
{2Sa 18:14} Joab said, "I will not waste time like this with you." And he took three javelins in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak.
{2Sa 18:14} 约押说：“我不能与你留连。”约押手拿三杆短枪，趁押沙龙在橡树上还活着，就刺透他的心。
{2Sa 18:15} And ten young men, Joab's armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him and killed him.
{2Sa 18:15} 给约押拿兵器的十个少年人围绕押沙龙，将他杀死。
{2Sa 18:16} Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained them.
{2Sa 18:16} 约押吹角，拦阻众人，他们就回来，不再追赶以色列人。
{2Sa 18:17} And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled every one to his own home.
{2Sa 18:17} 他们将押沙龙丢在林中一个大坑里，上头堆起一大堆石头。以色列众人都逃跑，各回各家去了。
{2Sa 18:18} Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King's Valley, for he said, "I have no son to keep my name in remembrance." He called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom's monument to this day.
{2Sa 18:18} 押沙龙活着的时候，在王谷立了一根石柱，因他说：“我没有儿子为我留名。”他就以自己的名称那石柱叫押沙龙柱，直到今日。
{2Sa 18:19} Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, "Let me run and carry news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies."
{2Sa 18:19} 撒督的儿子亚希玛斯说：“容我跑去，将耶和华向仇敌给王报仇的信息报与王知。”
{2Sa 18:20} And Joab said to him, "You are not to carry news today. You may carry news another day, but today you shall carry no news, because the king's son is dead."
{2Sa 18:20} 约押对他说：“你今日不可去报信，改日可以报信；因为今日王的儿子死了，所以你不可去报信。”
{2Sa 18:21} Then Joab said to the Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed before Joab, and ran.
{2Sa 18:21} 约押对古示人说：“你去将你所看见的告诉王。”古示人在约押面前下拜，就跑去了。
{2Sa 18:22} Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, "Come what may, let me also run after the Cushite." And Joab said, "Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?"
{2Sa 18:22} 撒督的儿子亚希玛斯又对约押说：“无论怎样，求你容我随着古示人跑去。”约押说：“我儿，你报这信息，既不得赏赐，何必要跑去呢？”
{2Sa 18:23} "Come what may," he said, "I will run." So he said to him, "Run." Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran the Cushite.
{2Sa 18:23} 他又说：“无论怎样，我要跑去。”约押说：“你跑去吧！”亚希玛斯就从平原往前跑，跑过古示人去了。
{2Sa 18:24} Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and when he lifted up his eyes and looked, he saw a man running alone.
{2Sa 18:24} 大卫正坐在城瓮里。守望的人上城门楼的顶上，举目观看，见有一个人独自跑来。
{2Sa 18:25} The watchman called out and told the king. And the king said, "If he is alone, there is news in his mouth." And he drew nearer and nearer.
{2Sa 18:25} 守望的人就大声告诉王。王说：“他若独自来，必是报口信的。”那人跑得渐渐近了。
{2Sa 18:26} The watchman saw another man running. And the watchman called to the gate and said, "See, another man running alone!" The king said, "He also brings news."
{2Sa 18:26} 守望的人又见一人跑来，就对守城门的人说：“又有一人独自跑来。”王说：“这也必是报信的。”
{2Sa 18:27} The watchman said, "I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok." And the king said, "He is a good man and comes with good news."
{2Sa 18:27} 守望的人说：“我看前头人的跑法，好像撒督的儿子亚希玛斯的跑法一样。”王说：“他是个好人，必是报好信息。”
{2Sa 18:28} Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, "All is well." And he bowed before the king with his face to the earth and said, "Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king."
{2Sa 18:28} 亚希玛斯向王呼叫说：“平安了！”就在王面前脸伏于地叩拜，说：“耶和华你的神是应当称颂的，因他已将那举手攻击我主我王的人交给王了。”
{2Sa 18:29} And the king said, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent the king's servant, your servant, I saw a great commotion, but I do not know what it was."
{2Sa 18:29} 王问说：“少年人押沙龙平安不平安？”亚希玛斯回答说：“约押打发王的仆人，那时仆人听见众民大声喧哗，却不知道是什么事。”
{2Sa 18:30} And the king said, "Turn aside and stand here." So he turned aside and stood still.
{2Sa 18:30} 王说：“你退去，站在旁边。”他就退去，站在旁边。
{2Sa 18:31} And behold, the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, "Good news for my lord the king! For the LORD has delivered you this day from the hand of all who rose up against you."
{2Sa 18:31} 古示人也来到，说：“有信息报给我主我王！耶和华今日向一切兴起攻击你的人给你报仇了。”
{2Sa 18:32} The king said to the Cushite, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" And the Cushite answered, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you for evil be like that young man."
{2Sa 18:32} 王问古示人说：“少年人押沙龙平安不平安？”古示人回答说：“愿我主我王的仇敌，和一切兴起要杀害你的人，都与那少年人一样。”
{2Sa 18:33} And the king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And as he went, he said, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
{2Sa 18:33} 王就心里伤恸，上城门楼去哀哭，一面走一面说：“我儿押沙龙啊！我儿，我儿押沙龙啊！我恨不得替你死，押沙龙啊，我儿！我儿！”
{2Sa 19:1}  It was told Joab, "Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom."
{2Sa 19:1}  有人告诉约押说：“王为押沙龙哭泣悲哀。”
{2Sa 19:2}  So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people, for the people heard that day, "The king is grieving for his son."
{2Sa 19:2}  众民听说王为他儿子忧愁，他们得胜的欢乐却变成悲哀。
{2Sa 19:3}  And the people stole into the city that day as people steal in who are ashamed when they flee in battle.
{2Sa 19:3}  那日众民暗暗的进城，就如败阵逃跑、惭愧的民一般。
{2Sa 19:4}  The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, "O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
{2Sa 19:4}  王蒙着脸，大声哭号说：“我儿押沙龙啊！押沙龙，我儿，我儿啊！”
{2Sa 19:5}  Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, "You have today covered with shame the faces of all your servants, who have this day saved your life and the lives of your sons and your daughters and the lives of your wives and your concubines,
{2Sa 19:5}  约押进去见王，说：“你今日使你一切仆人脸面惭愧了！他们今日救了你的性命和你儿女妻妾的性命，
{2Sa 19:6}  because you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. For you have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing to you, for today I know that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased.
{2Sa 19:6}  你却爱那恨你的人，恨那爱你的人。你今日明明的不以将帅、仆人为念。我今日看明，若押沙龙活着，我们都死亡，你就喜悦了。
{2Sa 19:7}  Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go, not a man will stay with you this night, and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now."
{2Sa 19:7}  现在你当出去，安慰你仆人的心。我指着耶和华起誓：你若不出去，今夜必无一人与你同在一处；这祸患就比你从幼年到如今所遭的更甚！”
{2Sa 19:8}  Then the king arose and took his seat in the gate. And the people were all told, "Behold, the king is sitting in the gate." And all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his own home.
{2Sa 19:8}  于是王起来，坐在城门口。众民听说王坐在城门口，就都到王面前。以色列人已经逃跑，各回各家去了。
{2Sa 19:9}  And all the people were arguing throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and saved us from the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.
{2Sa 19:9}  以色列众支派的人纷纷议论说：“王曾救我们脱离仇敌的手，又救我们脱离非利士人的手，现在他躲避押沙龙逃走了。
{2Sa 19:10} But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?"
{2Sa 19:10} 我们膏押沙龙治理我们，他已经阵亡。现在为什么不出一言请王回来呢？”
{2Sa 19:11} And King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests: "Say to the elders of Judah, 'Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house, when the word of all Israel has come to the king?
{2Sa 19:11} 大卫王差人去见祭司撒督和亚比亚他，说：“你们当向犹大长老说：‘以色列众人已经有话请王回宫，你们为什么落在他们后头呢？
{2Sa 19:12} You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?'
{2Sa 19:12} 你们是我的弟兄，是我的骨肉，为什么在人后头请王回来呢？’
{2Sa 19:13} And say to Amasa, 'Are you not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me and more also, if you are not commander of my army from now on in place of Joab.'"
{2Sa 19:13} 也要对亚玛撒说：‘你不是我的骨肉吗？我若不立你替约押常作元帅，愿神重重的降罚与我！’”
{2Sa 19:14} And he swayed the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, so that they sent word to the king, "Return, both you and all your servants."
{2Sa 19:14} 如此就挽回犹大众人的心，如同一人的心。他们便打发人去见王，说：“请王和王的一切臣仆回来。”
{2Sa 19:15} So the king came back to the Jordan, and Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to bring the king over the Jordan.
{2Sa 19:15} 王就回来，到了约但河。犹大人来到吉甲，要去迎接王，请他过约但河。
{2Sa 19:16} And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, from Bahurim, hurried to come down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
{2Sa 19:16} 巴户琳的便雅悯人、基拉的儿子示每急忙与犹大人一同下去迎接大卫王。
{2Sa 19:17} And with him were a thousand men from Benjamin. And Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons and his twenty servants, rushed down to the Jordan before the king,
{2Sa 19:17} 跟从示每的有一千便雅悯人，还有扫罗家的仆人洗巴和他十五个儿子，二十个仆人；他们都趟过约但河迎接王。
{2Sa 19:18} and they crossed the ford to bring over the king's household and to do his pleasure. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was about to cross the Jordan,
{2Sa 19:18} 有摆渡船过去，渡王的家眷，任王使用。王要过约但河的时候，基拉的儿子示每就俯伏在王面前，
{2Sa 19:19} and said to the king, "Let not my lord hold me guilty or remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. Do not let the king take it to heart.
{2Sa 19:19} 对王说：“我主我王出耶路撒冷的时候，仆人行悖逆的事，现在求我主不要因此加罪与仆人，不要记念，也不要放在心上。
{2Sa 19:20} For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I have come this day, the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king."
{2Sa 19:20} 仆人明知自己有罪，所以约瑟全家之中，今日我首先下来迎接我主我王。”
{2Sa 19:21} Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, "Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?"
{2Sa 19:21} 洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛说：“示每既咒骂耶和华的受膏者，不应当治死他吗？”
{2Sa 19:22} But David said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be as an adversary to me? Shall anyone be put to death in Israel this day? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?"
{2Sa 19:22} 大卫说：“洗鲁雅的儿子，我与你们有何关涉，使你们今日与我反对呢？今日在以色列中岂可治死人呢？我岂不知今日我作以色列的王吗？”
{2Sa 19:23} And the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." And the king gave him his oath.
{2Sa 19:23} 于是王对示每说：“你必不死。”王就向他起誓。
{2Sa 19:24} And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. He had neither taken care of his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came back in safety.
{2Sa 19:24} 扫罗的孙子米非波设也下去迎接王。他自从王去的日子，直到王平平安安的回来，没有修脚，没有剃胡须，也没有洗衣服。
{2Sa 19:25} And when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, "Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?"
{2Sa 19:25} 他来到耶路撒冷迎接王的时候，王问他说：“米非波设，你为什么没有与我同去呢？”
{2Sa 19:26} He answered, "My lord, O king, my servant deceived me, for your servant said to him, 'I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go with the king.' For your servant is lame.
{2Sa 19:26} 他回答说：“我主我王，仆人是瘸腿的。那日我想要备驴骑上，与王同去，无奈我的仆人欺哄了我，
{2Sa 19:27} He has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like the angel of God; do therefore what seems good to you.
{2Sa 19:27} 又在我主我王面前谗毁我。然而我主我王如同神的使者一般，你看怎样好，就怎样行吧！
{2Sa 19:28} For all my father's house were but men doomed to death before my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right have I, then, to cry to the king?"
{2Sa 19:28} 因为我祖全家的人，在我主我王面前都算为死人，王却使仆人在王的席上同人吃饭，我现在向王还能辨理诉冤吗？”
{2Sa 19:29} And the king said to him, "Why speak any more of your affairs? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land."
{2Sa 19:29} 王对他说：“你何必再提你的事呢？我说，你与洗巴均分地土。”
{2Sa 19:30} And Mephibosheth said to the king, "Oh, let him take it all, since my lord the king has come safely home."
{2Sa 19:30} 米非波设对王说：“我主我王既平平安安的回宫，就任凭洗巴都取了也可以。”
{2Sa 19:31} Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim, and he went on with the king to the Jordan, to escort him over the Jordan.
{2Sa 19:31} 基列人巴西莱从罗基琳下来，要送王过约但河，就与王一同过了约但河。
{2Sa 19:32} Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old. He had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.
{2Sa 19:32} 巴西莱年纪老迈，已经八十岁了。王住在玛哈念的时候，他就拿食物来供给王；他原是大富户。
{2Sa 19:33} And the king said to Barzillai, "Come over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem."
{2Sa 19:33} 王对巴西莱说：“你与我同去，我要在耶路撒冷那里养你的老。”
{2Sa 19:34} But Barzillai said to the king, "How many years have I still to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
{2Sa 19:34} 巴西莱对王说：“我在世的年日还能有多少，使我与王同上耶路撒冷呢？
{2Sa 19:35} I am this day eighty years old. Can I discern what is pleasant and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks? Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
{2Sa 19:35} 仆人现在八十岁了，还能尝出饮食的滋味、辨别美恶吗？还能听男女歌唱的声音吗？仆人何必累赘我主我王呢？
{2Sa 19:36} Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?
{2Sa 19:36} 仆人只要送王过约但河，王何必赐我这样的恩典呢？
{2Sa 19:37} Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him go over with my lord the king, and do for him whatever seems good to you."
{2Sa 19:37} 求你准我回去，好死在我本城，葬在我父母的墓旁。这里有王的仆人金罕，让他同我主我王过去，可以随意待他。”
{2Sa 19:38} And the king answered, "Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you, and all that you desire of me I will do for you."
{2Sa 19:38} 王说：“金罕可以与我同去，我必照你的心愿待他。你向我求什么，我都必为你成就。”
{2Sa 19:39} Then all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. And the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own home.
{2Sa 19:39} 于是众民过约但河，王也过去。王与巴西莱亲嘴，为他祝福，巴西莱就回本地去了。
{2Sa 19:40} The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. All the people of Judah, and also half the people of Israel, brought the king on his way.
{2Sa 19:40} 王过去，到了吉甲，金罕也跟他过去。犹大众民和以色列民的一半也都送王过去。
{2Sa 19:41} Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, "Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?"
{2Sa 19:41} 以色列众人来见王，对他说：“我们弟兄犹大人为什么暗暗送王和王的家眷，并跟随王的人过约但河？”
{2Sa 19:42} All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "Because the king is our close relative. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's expense? Or has he given us any gift?"
{2Sa 19:42} 犹大众人回答以色列人说：“因为王与我们是亲属，你们为何因这事发怒呢？我们吃了王的什么呢？王赏赐了我们什么呢？”
{2Sa 19:43} And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king, and in David also we have more than you. Why then did you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?" But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
{2Sa 19:43} 以色列人回答犹大人说：“按支派，我们与王有十分的情分；在大卫身上，我们也比你们更有情分。你们为何藐视我们，请王回来不先与我们商量呢？”但犹大人的话比以色列人的话更硬。
{2Sa 20:1}  Now there happened to be there a worthless man, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. And he blew the trumpet and said, "We have no portion in David, and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to his tents, O Israel!"
{2Sa 20:1}  在那里恰巧有一个匪徒，名叫示巴，是便雅悯人比基利的儿子。他吹角，说：“我们与大卫无分，与耶西的儿子无涉。以色列人哪，你们各回各家去吧！”
{2Sa 20:2}  So all the men of Israel withdrew from David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah followed their king steadfastly from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
{2Sa 20:2}  于是以色列人都离开大卫，跟随比基利的儿子示巴。但犹大人从约但河直到耶路撒冷，都紧紧跟随他们的王。
{2Sa 20:3}  And David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to care for the house and put them in a house under guard and provided for them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as if in widowhood.
{2Sa 20:3}  大卫王来到耶路撒冷，进了宫殿，就把从前留下看守宫殿的十个妃嫔禁闭在冷宫，养活他们，不与他们亲近。他们如同寡妇被禁，直到死的日子。
{2Sa 20:4}  Then the king said to Amasa, "Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and be here yourself."
{2Sa 20:4}  王对亚玛撒说：“你要在三日之内将犹大人招聚了来，你也回到这里来。”
{2Sa 20:5}  So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he delayed beyond the set time that had been appointed him.
{2Sa 20:5}  亚玛撒就去招聚犹大人，却耽延过了王所限的日期。
{2Sa 20:6}  And David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord's servants and pursue him, lest he get himself to fortified cities and escape from us."
{2Sa 20:6}  大卫对亚比筛说：“现在恐怕比基利的儿子示巴加害于我们比押沙龙更甚。你要带领你主的仆人追赶他，免得他得了坚固城，躲避我们。”
{2Sa 20:7}  And there went out after him Joab's men and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men. They went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
{2Sa 20:7}  约押的人和基利提人、比利提人，并所有的勇士，都跟着亚比筛，从耶路撒冷出去追赶比基利的儿子示巴。
{2Sa 20:8}  When they were at the great stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was wearing a soldier's garment, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened on his thigh, and as he went forward it fell out.
{2Sa 20:8}  他们到了基遍的大磐石那里，亚玛撒来迎接他们。那时约押穿着战衣，腰束佩刀的带子，刀在鞘内；约押前行，刀从鞘内掉出来。
{2Sa 20:9}  And Joab said to Amasa, "Is it well with you, my brother?" And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
{2Sa 20:9}  约押左手拾起刀来，对亚玛撒说：“我兄弟，你好啊！”就用右手抓住亚玛撒的胡子，要与他亲嘴。
{2Sa 20:10} But Amasa did not observe the sword that was in Joab's hand. So Joab struck him with it in the stomach and spilled his entrails to the ground without striking a second blow, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.
{2Sa 20:10} 亚玛撒没有防备约押手里所拿的刀；约押用刀刺入他的肚腹，他的肠子流在地上，没有再刺他，就死了。约押和他兄弟亚比筛往前追赶比基利的儿子示巴。
{2Sa 20:11} And one of Joab's young men took his stand by Amasa and said, "Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab."
{2Sa 20:11} 有约押的一个少年人站在亚玛撒尸身旁边，对众人说：“谁喜悦约押，谁归顺大卫，就当跟随约押去。”
{2Sa 20:12} And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the highway. And anyone who came by, seeing him, stopped. And when the man saw that all the people stopped, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field and threw a garment over him.
{2Sa 20:12} 亚玛撒在道路上滚在自己的血里。那人见众民经过都站住，就把亚玛撒的尸身从路上挪到田间，用衣服遮盖。
{2Sa 20:13} When he was taken out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
{2Sa 20:13} 尸身从路上挪移之后，众民就都跟随约押去追赶比基利的儿子示巴。
{2Sa 20:14} And Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah, and all the Bichrites assembled and followed him in.
{2Sa 20:14} 他走遍以色列各支派，直到伯玛迦的亚比拉，并比利人的全地；那些地方的人也都聚集跟随他。
{2Sa 20:15} And all the men who were with Joab came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah. They cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart, and they were battering the wall to throw it down.
{2Sa 20:15} 约押和跟随的人到了伯玛迦的亚比拉，围困示巴，就对着城筑垒；跟随约押的众民用锤撞城，要使城塌陷。
{2Sa 20:16} Then a wise woman called from the city, "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab, 'Come here, that I may speak to you.'"
{2Sa 20:16} 有一个聪明妇人从城上呼叫说：“听啊，听啊，请约押近前来，我好与他说话。”
{2Sa 20:17} And he came near her, and the woman said, "Are you Joab?" He answered, "I am." Then she said to him, "Listen to the words of your servant." And he answered, "I am listening."
{2Sa 20:17} 约押就近前来，妇人问他说：“你是约押不是？”他说：“我是。”妇人说：“求你听婢女的话。”约押说：“我听。”
{2Sa 20:18} Then she said, "They used to say in former times, 'Let them but ask counsel at Abel,' and so they settled a matter.
{2Sa 20:18} 妇人说：“古时有话说，当先在亚比拉求问，然后事就定妥。
{2Sa 20:19} I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the heritage of the LORD?"
{2Sa 20:19} 我们这城的人在以色列人中是和平、忠厚的。你为何要毁坏以色列中的大城，吞灭耶和华的产业呢？”
{2Sa 20:20} Joab answered, "Far be it from me, far be it, that I should swallow up or destroy!
{2Sa 20:20} 约押回答说：“我决不吞灭毁坏，
{2Sa 20:21} That is not true. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, called Sheba the son of Bichri, has lifted up his hand against King David. Give up him alone, and I will withdraw from the city." And the woman said to Joab, "Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall."
{2Sa 20:21} 乃因以法莲山地的一个人比基利的儿子示巴举手攻击大卫王，你们若将他一人交出来，我便离城而去。”妇人对约押说：“那人的首级必从城墙上丢给你。”
{2Sa 20:22} Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it out to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his home. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
{2Sa 20:22} 妇人就凭他的智慧去劝众人。他们便割下比基利的儿子示巴的首级，丢给约押。约押吹角，众人就离城而散，各归各家去了。约押回耶路撒冷，到王那里。
{2Sa 20:23} Now Joab was in command of all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
{2Sa 20:23} 约押作以色列全军的元帅；耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅统辖基利提人和比利提人；
{2Sa 20:24} and Adoram was in charge of the forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
{2Sa 20:24} 亚多兰掌管服苦的人；亚希律的儿子约沙法作史官；
{2Sa 20:25} and Sheva was secretary; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
{2Sa 20:25} 示法作书记；撒督和亚比亚他作祭司长；
{2Sa 20:26} and Ira the Jairite was also David's priest.
{2Sa 20:26} 睚珥人以拉作大卫的宰相。
{2Sa 21:1}  Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year. And David sought the face of the LORD. And the LORD said, "There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house, because he put the Gibeonites to death."
{2Sa 21:1}  大卫年间有饥荒，一连三年，大卫就求问耶和华。耶和华说：“这饥荒是因扫罗和他流人血之家杀死基遍人。”
{2Sa 21:2}  So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not of the people of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites. Although the people of Israel had sworn to spare them, Saul had sought to strike them down in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.
{2Sa 21:2}  原来这基遍人不是以色列人，乃是亚摩利人中所剩的；以色列人曾向他们起誓，不杀灭他们，扫罗却为以色列人和犹大人发热心，想要杀灭他们。大卫王召了他们来，
{2Sa 21:3}  And David said to the Gibeonites, "What shall I do for you? And how shall I make atonement, that you may bless the heritage of the LORD?"
{2Sa 21:3}  问他们说：“我当为你们怎样行呢？可用什么赎这罪，使你们为耶和华的产业祝福呢？”
{2Sa 21:4}  The Gibeonites said to him, "It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel." And he said, "What do you say that I shall do for you?"
{2Sa 21:4}  基遍人回答说：“我们和扫罗与他家的事并不关乎金银，也不要因我们的缘故杀一个以色列人。”大卫说：“你们怎样说，我就为你们怎样行。”
{2Sa 21:5}  They said to the king, "The man who consumed us and planned to destroy us, so that we should have no place in all the territory of Israel,
{2Sa 21:5}  他们对王说：“那从前谋害我们、要灭我们、使我们不得再住以色列境内的人，
{2Sa 21:6}  let seven of his sons be given to us, so that we may hang them before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD." And the king said, "I will give them."
{2Sa 21:6}  现在愿将他的子孙七人交给我们，我们好在耶和华面前，将他们悬挂在耶和华拣选扫罗的基比亚。”王说：“我必交给你们。”
{2Sa 21:7}  But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of the oath of the LORD that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
{2Sa 21:7}  王因为曾与扫罗的儿子约拿单指着耶和华起誓结盟，就爱惜扫罗的孙子、约拿单的儿子米非波设，不交出来，
{2Sa 21:8}  The king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite;
{2Sa 21:8}  却把爱雅的女儿利斯巴给扫罗所生的两个儿子亚摩尼、米非波设，和扫罗女儿米甲的姊姊给米何拉人巴西莱儿子亚得列所生的五个儿子
{2Sa 21:9}  and he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the mountain before the LORD, and the seven of them perished together. They were put to death in the first days of harvest, at the beginning of barley harvest.
{2Sa 21:9}  交在基遍人的手里。基遍人就把他们，在耶和华面前，悬挂在山上，这七人就一同死亡。被杀的时候正是收割的日子，就是动手割大麦的时候。
{2Sa 21:10} Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until rain fell upon them from the heavens. And she did not allow the birds of the air to come upon them by day, or the beasts of the field by night.
{2Sa 21:10} 爱雅的女儿利斯巴用麻布在磐石上搭棚，从动手收割的时候直到天降雨在尸身上的时候，日间不容空中的雀鸟落在尸身上，夜间不让田野的走兽前来糟践。
{2Sa 21:11} When David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done,
{2Sa 21:11} 有人将扫罗的妃嫔爱雅女儿利斯巴所行的这事告诉大卫。
{2Sa 21:12} David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, on the day the Philistines killed Saul on Gilboa.
{2Sa 21:12} 大卫就去，从基列雅比人那里将扫罗和他儿子约拿单的骸骨搬了来（是因非利士人从前在基利波杀扫罗，将尸身悬挂在伯珊的街市上，基列雅比人把尸身偷了去。）
{2Sa 21:13} And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan; and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.
{2Sa 21:13} 大卫将扫罗和他儿子约拿单的骸骨从那里搬了来，又收殓被悬挂七人的骸骨，
{2Sa 21:14} And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father. And they did all that the king commanded. And after that God responded to the plea for the land.
{2Sa 21:14} 将扫罗和他儿子约拿单的骸骨葬在便雅悯的洗拉，在扫罗父亲基士的坟墓里；众人行了王所吩咐的。此后神垂听国民所求的。
{2Sa 21:15} There was war again between the Philistines and Israel, and David went down together with his servants, and they fought against the Philistines. And David grew weary.
{2Sa 21:15} 非利士人与以色列人打仗；大卫带领仆人下去，与非利士人接战，大卫就疲乏了。
{2Sa 21:16} And Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants of the giants, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of bronze, and who was armed with a new sword, thought to kill David.
{2Sa 21:16} 伟人的一个儿子以实比诺要杀大卫；他的铜枪重三百舍客勒，又佩着新刀。
{2Sa 21:17} But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid and attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, "You shall no longer go out with us to battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel."
{2Sa 21:17} 但洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛帮助大卫，攻打非利士人，将他杀死。当日，跟随大卫的人向大卫起誓说：“以后你不可再与我们一同出战，恐怕熄灭以色列的灯。”
{2Sa 21:18} After this there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was one of the descendants of the giants.
{2Sa 21:18} 后来，以色列人在歌伯与非利士人打仗，户沙人西比该杀了伟人的一个儿子撒弗。
{2Sa 21:19} And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite, struck down Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
{2Sa 21:19} 又在歌伯与非利士人打仗，伯利恒人雅雷俄珥金的儿子伊勒哈难杀了迦特人歌利亚。这人的枪杆粗如织布的机轴。
{2Sa 21:20} And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the giants.
{2Sa 21:20} 又在迦特打仗，那里有一个身量高大的人，手脚都是六指，共有二十四个指头；他也是伟人的儿子。
{2Sa 21:21} And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, struck him down.
{2Sa 21:21} 这人向以色列人骂阵，大卫的哥哥示米亚的儿子约拿单就杀了他。
{2Sa 21:22} These four were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
{2Sa 21:22} 这四个人是迦特伟人的儿子，都死在大卫和他仆人的手下。
{2Sa 22:1}  And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul.
{2Sa 22:1}  当耶和华救大卫脱离一切仇敌和扫罗之手的日子，他向耶和华念这诗，
{2Sa 22:2}  He said, "The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer,
{2Sa 22:2}  说：耶和华是我的岩石，我的山寨，我的救主，
{2Sa 22:3}  my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.
{2Sa 22:3}  我的神，我的磐石，我所投靠的。他是我的盾牌，是拯救我的角，是我的高台，是我的避难所。我的救主啊，你是救我脱离强暴的。
{2Sa 22:4}  I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.
{2Sa 22:4}  我要求告当赞美的耶和华，这样，我必从仇敌手中被救出来。
{2Sa 22:5}  "For the waves of death encompassed me, the torrents of destruction assailed me;
{2Sa 22:5}  曾有死亡的波浪环绕我，匪类的急流使我惊惧，
{2Sa 22:6}  the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
{2Sa 22:6}  阴间的绳索缠绕我，死亡的网罗临到我。
{2Sa 22:7}  "In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I called. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry came to his ears.
{2Sa 22:7}  我在急难中求告耶和华，向我的神呼求。他从殿中听了我的声音；我的呼求入了他的耳中。
{2Sa 22:8}  "Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations of the heavens trembled and quaked, because he was angry.
{2Sa 22:8}  那时因他发怒，地就摇撼战抖；天的根基也震动摇撼。
{2Sa 22:9}  Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.
{2Sa 22:9}  从他鼻孔冒烟上腾；从他口中发火焚烧，连炭也着了。
{2Sa 22:10} He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.
{2Sa 22:10} 他又使天下垂，亲自降临；有黑云在他脚下。
{2Sa 22:11} He rode on a cherub and flew; he was seen on the wings of the wind.
{2Sa 22:11} 他坐着基路伯飞行，在风的翅膀上显现。
{2Sa 22:12} He made darkness around him his canopy, thick clouds, a gathering of water.
{2Sa 22:12} 他以黑暗和聚集的水、天空的厚云为他四围的行宫。
{2Sa 22:13} Out of the brightness before him coals of fire flamed forth.
{2Sa 22:13} 因他面前的光辉炭都着了。
{2Sa 22:14} The LORD thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice.
{2Sa 22:14} 耶和华从天上打雷；至高者发出声音。
{2Sa 22:15} And he sent out arrows and scattered them; lightning, and routed them.
{2Sa 22:15} 他射出箭来，使仇敌四散，发出闪电，使他们扰乱。
{2Sa 22:16} Then the channels of the sea were seen; the foundations of the world were laid bare, at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
{2Sa 22:16} 耶和华的斥责一发，鼻孔的气一出，海底就出现，大地的根基也显露。
{2Sa 22:17} "He sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters.
{2Sa 22:17} 他从高天伸手抓住我，把我从大水中拉上来。
{2Sa 22:18} He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
{2Sa 22:18} 他救我脱离我的劲敌和那些恨我的人，因为他们比我强盛。
{2Sa 22:19} They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my support.
{2Sa 22:19} 我遭遇灾难的日子，他们来攻击我；但耶和华是我的倚靠。
{2Sa 22:20} He brought me out into a broad place; he rescued me, because he delighted in me.
{2Sa 22:20} 他又领我到宽阔之处；他救拔我，因他喜悦我。
{2Sa 22:21} "The LORD dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me.
{2Sa 22:21} 耶和华按着我的公义报答我，按着我手中的清洁赏赐我。
{2Sa 22:22} For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my God.
{2Sa 22:22} 因为我遵守了耶和华的道，未曾作恶离开我的神。
{2Sa 22:23} For all his rules were before me, and from his statutes I did not turn aside.
{2Sa 22:23} 他的一切典章常在我面前；他的律例，我也未曾离弃。
{2Sa 22:24} I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from guilt.
{2Sa 22:24} 我在他面前作了完全人；我也保守自己远离我的罪孽。
{2Sa 22:25} And the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his sight.
{2Sa 22:25} 所以耶和华按我的公义，按我在他眼前的清洁赏赐我。
{2Sa 22:26} "With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless man you show yourself blameless;
{2Sa 22:26} 慈爱的人，你以慈爱待他；完全的人，你以完全待他；
{2Sa 22:27} with the purified you deal purely, and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous.
{2Sa 22:27} 清洁的人，你以清洁待他；乖僻的人，你以弯曲待他。
{2Sa 22:28} You save a humble people, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them down.
{2Sa 22:28} 困苦的百姓，你必拯救；但你的眼目察看高傲的人，使他降卑。
{2Sa 22:29} For you are my lamp, O LORD, and my God lightens my darkness.
{2Sa 22:29} 耶和华啊，你是我的灯；耶和华必照明我的黑暗。
{2Sa 22:30} For by you I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.
{2Sa 22:30} 我藉着你冲入敌军，藉着我的神跳过墙垣。
{2Sa 22:31} This God--his way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.
{2Sa 22:31} 至于神，他的道是完全的；耶和华的话是炼净的。凡投靠他的，他便作他们的盾牌。
{2Sa 22:32} "For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?
{2Sa 22:32} 除了耶和华，谁是神呢？除了我们的神，谁是磐石呢？
{2Sa 22:33} This God is my strong refuge and has made my way blameless.
{2Sa 22:33} 神是我坚固的保障；他引导完全人行他的路。
{2Sa 22:34} He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights.
{2Sa 22:34} 他使我的脚快如母鹿的蹄，又使我在高处安稳。
{2Sa 22:35} He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
{2Sa 22:35} 他教导我的手能以争战，甚至我的膀臂能开铜弓。
{2Sa 22:36} You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your gentleness made me great.
{2Sa 22:36} 你把你的救恩给我作盾牌；你的温和使我为大。
{2Sa 22:37} You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip;
{2Sa 22:37} 你使我脚下的地步宽阔；我的脚未曾滑跌。
{2Sa 22:38} I pursued my enemies and destroyed them, and did not turn back until they were consumed.
{2Sa 22:38} 我追赶我的仇敌，灭绝了他们，未灭以先，我没有归回。
{2Sa 22:39} I consumed them; I thrust them through, so that they did not rise; they fell under my feet.
{2Sa 22:39} 我灭绝了他们，打伤了他们，使他们不能起来；他们都倒在我的脚下。
{2Sa 22:40} For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me.
{2Sa 22:40} 因为你曾以力量束我的腰，使我能争战；你也使那起来攻击我的都服在我以下。
{2Sa 22:41} You made my enemies turn their backs to me, those who hated me, and I destroyed them.
{2Sa 22:41} 你又使我的仇敌在我面前转背逃跑，叫我能以剪除那恨我的人。
{2Sa 22:42} They looked, but there was none to save; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.
{2Sa 22:42} 他们仰望，却无人拯救；就是呼求耶和华，他也不应允。
{2Sa 22:43} I beat them fine as the dust of the earth; I crushed them and stamped them down like the mire of the streets.
{2Sa 22:43} 我捣碎他们，如同地上的灰尘，践踏他们，四散在地，如同街上的泥土。
{2Sa 22:44} "You delivered me from strife with my people; you kept me as the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.
{2Sa 22:44} 你救我脱离我百姓的争竞，保护我作列国的元首；我素不认识的民必事奉我。
{2Sa 22:45} Foreigners came cringing to me; as soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me.
{2Sa 22:45} 外邦人要投降我，一听见我的名声就必顺从我。
{2Sa 22:46} Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses.
{2Sa 22:46} 外邦人要衰残，战战兢兢地出他们的营寨。
{2Sa 22:47} "The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be my God, the rock of my salvation,
{2Sa 22:47} 耶和华是活神，愿我的磐石被人称颂！愿神那拯救我的磐石被人尊崇！
{2Sa 22:48} the God who gave me vengeance and brought down peoples under me,
{2Sa 22:48} 这位神就是那为我伸冤、使众民服在我以下的。
{2Sa 22:49} who brought me out from my enemies; you exalted me above those who rose against me; you delivered me from men of violence.
{2Sa 22:49} 你救我脱离仇敌，又把我举起，高过那些起来攻击我的；你救我脱离强暴的人。
{2Sa 22:50} "For this I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to your name.
{2Sa 22:50} 耶和华啊，因此我要在外邦中称谢你，歌颂你的名。
{2Sa 22:51} Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever."
{2Sa 22:51} 耶和华赐极大的救恩给他所立的王，施慈爱给他的受膏者，就是给大卫和他的后裔，直到永远！
{2Sa 23:1}  Now these are the last words of David: The oracle of David, the son of Jesse, the oracle of the man who was raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, the sweet psalmist of Israel:
{2Sa 23:1}  以下是大卫末了的话。耶西的儿子大卫得居高位，是雅各神所膏的，作以色列的美歌者，说：
{2Sa 23:2}  "The Spirit of the LORD speaks by me; his word is on my tongue.
{2Sa 23:2}  耶和华的灵藉着我说：他的话在我口中。
{2Sa 23:3}  The God of Israel has spoken; the Rock of Israel has said to me: When one rules justly over men, ruling in the fear of God,
{2Sa 23:3}  以色列的神、以色列的磐石晓谕我说：那以公义治理人民的，敬畏神执掌权柄，
{2Sa 23:4}  he dawns on them like the morning light, like the sun shining forth on a cloudless morning, like rain that makes grass to sprout from the earth.
{2Sa 23:4}  他必像日出的晨光，如无云的清晨，雨后的晴光，使地发生嫩草。
{2Sa 23:5}  "For does not my house stand so with God? For he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and secure. For will he not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?
{2Sa 23:5}  我家在神面前并非如此；神却与我立永远的约。这约凡事坚稳，关乎我的一切救恩和我一切所想望的，他岂不为我成就吗？
{2Sa 23:6}  But worthless men are all like thorns that are thrown away, for they cannot be taken with the hand;
{2Sa 23:6}  但匪类都必像荆棘被丢弃；人不敢用手拿他；
{2Sa 23:7}  but the man who touches them arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear, and they are utterly consumed with fire."
{2Sa 23:7}  拿他的人必带铁器和枪杆，终久他必被火焚烧。
{2Sa 23:8}  These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite; he was chief of the three. He wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time.
{2Sa 23:8}  大卫勇士的名字记在下面：他革扪人约设巴设，又称伊斯尼人亚底挪，他是军长的统领，一时击杀了八百人。
{2Sa 23:9}  And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, son of Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew.
{2Sa 23:9}  其次是亚合人朵多的儿子以利亚撒。从前非利士人聚集要打仗，以色列人迎着上去，有跟随大卫的三个勇士向非利士人骂阵，其中有以利亚撒。
{2Sa 23:10} He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. And the LORD brought about a great victory that day, and the men returned after him only to strip the slain.
{2Sa 23:10} 他起来击杀非利士人，直到手臂疲乏，手黏住刀把。那日耶和华使以色列人大获全胜；众民在以利亚撒后头专夺财物。
{2Sa 23:11} And next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the men fled from the Philistines.
{2Sa 23:11} 其次是哈拉人亚基的儿子沙玛。一日，非利士人聚集成群，在一块长满红豆的田里，众民就在非利士人面前逃跑。
{2Sa 23:12} But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines, and the LORD worked a great victory.
{2Sa 23:12} 沙玛却站在那田间击杀非利士人，救护了那田。耶和华使以色列人大获全胜。
{2Sa 23:13} And three of the thirty chief men went down and came about harvest time to David at the cave of Adullam, when a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
{2Sa 23:13} 收割的时候，有三十个勇士中的三个人下到亚杜兰洞见大卫。非利士的军兵在利乏音谷安营。
{2Sa 23:14} David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
{2Sa 23:14} 那时大卫在山寨，非利士人的防营在伯利恒。
{2Sa 23:15} And David said longingly, "Oh, that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!"
{2Sa 23:15} 大卫渴想，说：“甚愿有人将伯利恒城门旁、井里的水打来给我喝。”
{2Sa 23:16} Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and carried and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it. He poured it out to the LORD
{2Sa 23:16} 这三个勇士就闯过非利士人的营盘，从伯利恒城门旁的井里打水，拿来奉给大卫。他却不肯喝，将水奠在耶和华面前，
{2Sa 23:17} and said, "Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?" Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.
{2Sa 23:17} 说：“耶和华啊，这三个人冒死去打水；这水好像他们的血一般，我断不敢喝。”如此，大卫不肯喝。这是三个勇士所做的事。
{2Sa 23:18} Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against three hundred men and killed them and won a name beside the three.
{2Sa 23:18} 洗鲁雅的儿子、约押的兄弟亚比筛是这三个勇士的首领；他举枪杀了三百人，就在三个勇士里得了名。
{2Sa 23:19} He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.
{2Sa 23:19} 他在这三个勇士里是最尊贵的，所以作他们的首领，只是不及前三个勇士。
{2Sa 23:20} And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two ariels of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
{2Sa 23:20} 有甲薛勇士耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅行过大能的事；他杀了摩押人亚利伊勒的两个儿子，又在下雪的时候下坑里去，杀了一个狮子，
{2Sa 23:21} And he struck down an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
{2Sa 23:21} 又杀了一个强壮的埃及人；埃及人手里拿着枪，比拿雅只拿着棍子下去，从埃及人手里夺过枪来，用那枪将他杀死。
{2Sa 23:22} These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name beside the three mighty men.
{2Sa 23:22} 这是耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅所行的事，就在三个勇士里得了名。
{2Sa 23:23} He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
{2Sa 23:23} 他比那三十个勇士都尊贵，只是不及前三个勇士。大卫立他作护卫长。
{2Sa 23:24} Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
{2Sa 23:24} 三十个勇士里有约押的兄弟亚撒黑，伯利恒人朵多的儿子伊勒哈难，
{2Sa 23:25} Shammah of Harod, Elika of Harod,

{2Sa 23:29} 尼陀法人巴拿的儿子希立，便雅悯族、基比亚人利拜的儿子以太，
{2Sa 23:30} Benaiah of Pirathon, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
{2Sa 23:30} 比拉顿人比拿雅，迦实溪人希太，
{2Sa 23:31} Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Bahurim,
{2Sa 23:31} 伯亚拉巴人亚比亚本，巴鲁米人押斯玛弗，
{2Sa 23:32} Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
{2Sa 23:32} 沙本人以利雅哈巴，雅善儿子中的约拿单，
{2Sa 23:33} Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
{2Sa 23:33} 哈拉人沙玛，哈拉人沙拉的儿子亚希暗，
{2Sa 23:34} Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai of Maacah, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
{2Sa 23:34} 玛迦人亚哈拜的儿子以利法列，基罗人亚希多弗的儿子以连，
{2Sa 23:35} Hezro of Carmel, Paarai the Arbite,
{2Sa 23:35} 迦密人希斯莱，亚巴人帕莱，
{2Sa 23:36} Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
{2Sa 23:36} 琐巴人拿单的儿子以甲，迦得人巴尼，
{2Sa 23:37} Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Beeroth, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
{2Sa 23:37} 亚扪人洗勒，比录人拿哈莱（是给洗鲁雅的儿子约押拿兵器的），
{2Sa 23:38} Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
{2Sa 23:38} 以帖人以拉，以帖人迦立，
{2Sa 23:39} Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.
{2Sa 23:39} 赫人乌利亚，共有三十七人。
{2Sa 24:1}  Again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, "Go, number Israel and Judah."
{2Sa 24:1}  耶和华又向以色列人发怒，就激动大卫，使他吩咐人去数点以色列人和犹大人。
{2Sa 24:2}  So the king said to Joab, the commander of the army, who was with him, "Go through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and number the people, that I may know the number of the people."
{2Sa 24:2}  大卫就吩咐跟随他的元帅约押说：“你去走遍以色列众支派，从但直到别是巴，数点百姓，我好知道他们的数目。”
{2Sa 24:3}  But Joab said to the king, "May the LORD your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king still see it, but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?"
{2Sa 24:3}  约押对王说：“无论百姓多少，愿耶和华你的神再加增百倍，使我主我王亲眼得见。我主我王何必喜悦行这事呢？”
{2Sa 24:4}  But the king's word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.
{2Sa 24:4}  但王的命令胜过约押和众军长。约押和众军长就从王面前出去，数点以色列的百姓。
{2Sa 24:5}  They crossed the Jordan and began from Aroer, and from the city that is in the middle of the valley, toward Gad and on to Jazer.
{2Sa 24:5}  他们过了约但河，在迦得谷中、城的右边亚罗珥安营，与雅谢相对，
{2Sa 24:6}  Then they came to Gilead, and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites; and they came to Dan, and from Dan they went around to Sidon,
{2Sa 24:6}  又到了基列和他停合示地，又到了但雅安，绕到西顿，
{2Sa 24:7}  and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites; and they went out to the Negeb of Judah at Beersheba.
{2Sa 24:7}  来到推罗的保障，并希未人和迦南人的各城，又到犹大南方的别是巴。
{2Sa 24:8}  So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
{2Sa 24:8}  他们走遍全地，过了九个月零二十天，就回到耶路撒冷。
{2Sa 24:9}  And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: in Israel there were 800,000 valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were 500,000.
{2Sa 24:9}  约押将百姓的总数奏告于王：以色列拿刀的勇士有八十万；犹大有五十万。
{2Sa 24:10} But David's heart struck him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly."
{2Sa 24:10} 大卫数点百姓以后，就心中自责，祷告耶和华说：“我行这事大有罪了。耶和华啊，求你除掉仆人的罪孽，因我所行的甚是愚昧。”
{2Sa 24:11} And when David arose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
{2Sa 24:11} 大卫早晨起来，耶和华的话临到先知迦得，就是大卫的先见，说：
{2Sa 24:12} "Go and say to David, 'Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer you. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.'"
{2Sa 24:12} “你去告诉大卫，说耶和华如此说：‘我有三样灾，随你选择一样，我好降与你。’”
{2Sa 24:13} So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, "Shall three years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now consider, and decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me."
{2Sa 24:13} 于是迦得来见大卫，对他说：“你愿意国中有七年的饥荒呢？是在你敌人面前逃跑，被追赶三个月呢？是在你国中有三日的瘟疫呢？现在你要揣摩思想，我好回覆那差我来的。”
{2Sa 24:14} Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress. Let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but let me not fall into the hand of man."
{2Sa 24:14} 大卫对迦得说：“我甚为难！我愿落在耶和华的手里，因为他有丰盛的怜悯。我不愿落在人的手里。”
{2Sa 24:15} So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the appointed time. And there died of the people from Dan to Beersheba 70,000 men.
{2Sa 24:15} 于是，耶和华降瘟疫与以色列人，自早晨到所定的时候；从但直到别是巴，民间死了七万人。
{2Sa 24:16} And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was working destruction among the people, "It is enough; now stay your hand." And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
{2Sa 24:16} 天使向耶路撒冷伸手要灭城的时候，耶和华后悔，就不降这灾了，吩咐灭民的天使说：“够了！住手吧！”那时耶和华的使者在耶布斯人亚劳拿的禾场那里。
{2Sa 24:17} Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking the people, and said, "Behold, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me and against my father's house."
{2Sa 24:17} 大卫看见灭民的天使，就祷告耶和华说：“我犯了罪，行了恶；但这群羊做了什么呢？愿你的手攻击我和我的父家。”
{2Sa 24:18} And Gad came that day to David and said to him, "Go up, raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
{2Sa 24:18} 当日，迦得来见大卫，对他说：“你上去，在耶布斯人亚劳拿的禾场上为耶和华筑一座坛。”
{2Sa 24:19} So David went up at Gad's word, as the LORD commanded.
{2Sa 24:19} 大卫就照着迦得奉耶和华名所说的话上去了。
{2Sa 24:20} And when Araunah looked down, he saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. And Araunah went out and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground.
{2Sa 24:20} 亚劳拿观看，见王和他臣仆前来，就迎接出去，脸伏于地，向王下拜，
{2Sa 24:21} And Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" David said, "To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be averted from the people."
{2Sa 24:21} 说：“我主我王为何来到仆人这里呢？”大卫说：“我要买你这禾场，为耶和华筑一座坛，使民间的瘟疫止住。”
{2Sa 24:22} Then Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Here are the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.
{2Sa 24:22} 亚劳拿对大卫说：“我主我王，你喜悦用什么，就拿去献祭。看哪，这里有牛可以作燔祭，有打粮的器具和套牛的轭可以当柴烧。
{2Sa 24:23} All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king." And Araunah said to the king, "May the LORD your God accept you."
{2Sa 24:23} 王啊，这一切，我亚劳拿都奉给你”；又对王说：“愿耶和华你的神悦纳你。”
{2Sa 24:24} But the king said to Araunah, "No, but I will buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
{2Sa 24:24} 王对亚劳拿说：“不然。我必要按着价值向你买；我不肯用白得之物作燔祭献给耶和华我的神。”大卫就用五十舍客勒银子买了那禾场与牛。
{2Sa 24:25} And David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD responded to the plea for the land, and the plague was averted from Israel.
{2Sa 24:25} 大卫在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛，献燔祭和平安祭。如此，耶和华垂听国民所求的，瘟疫在以色列人中就止住了。
