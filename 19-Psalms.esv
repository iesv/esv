{Psa 10:13} 恶人为何轻慢神，心里说：你必不追究？
{Psa 10:14} But you do see, for you note mischief and vexation, that you may take it into your hands; to you the helpless commits himself; you have been the helper of the fatherless.
{Psa 10:14} 其实你已经观看；因为奸恶毒害，你都看见了，为要以手施行报应。无倚无靠的人把自己交托你；你向来是帮助孤儿的。
{Psa 10:15} Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call his wickedness to account till you find none.

{Psa 10:18} to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.
{Psa 10:18} 为要给孤儿和受欺压的人伸冤，使强横的人不再威吓他们。

{Psa 11:1}  （大卫的诗，交与伶长。）我是投靠耶和华；你们怎么对我说：你当像鸟飞往你的山去。

{Psa 12:1}  （大卫的诗，交与伶长。调用第八。）耶和华啊，求你帮助，因虔诚人断绝了；世人中间的忠信人没有了。
{Psa 12:2}  Everyone utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
{Psa 12:2}  人人向邻舍说谎；他们说话，是嘴唇油滑，心口不一。
{Psa 12:3}  May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,
{Psa 12:3}  凡油滑的嘴唇和夸大的舌头，耶和华必要剪除。

{Psa 14:1}  （大卫的诗，交与伶长。）愚顽人心里说：没有神。他们都是邪恶，行了可憎恶的事；没有一个人行善。
{Psa 14:2}  The LORD looks down from heaven on the children of man, to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.
{Psa 14:2}  耶和华从天上垂看世人，要看有明白的没有，有寻求神的没有。
{Psa 14:3}  They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.
{Psa 14:3}  他们都偏离正路，一同变为污秽；并没有行善的，连一个也没有。

{Psa 39:12} "Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears! For I am a sojourner with you, a guest, like all my fathers.
{Psa 39:12} 耶和华啊，求你听我的祷告，留心听我的呼求！我流泪，求你不要静默无声！因为我在你面前是客旅，是寄居的，像我列祖一般。
{Psa 39:13} Look away from me, that I may smile again, before I depart and am no more!"
{Psa 39:13} 求你宽容我，使我在去而不返之先可以力量复原。
{Psa 40:1}  To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry.
{Psa 40:1}  （大卫的诗，交与伶长。）我曾耐性等候耶和华；他垂听我的呼求。
{Psa 40:2}  He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
{Psa 40:2}  他从祸坑里，从淤泥中，把我拉上来，使我的脚立在磐石上，使我脚步稳当。
{Psa 40:3}  He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the LORD.
{Psa 40:3}  他使我口唱新歌，就是赞美我们神的话。许多人必看见而惧怕，并要倚靠耶和华。
{Psa 40:4}  Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after a lie!
{Psa 40:4}  那倚靠耶和华、不理会狂傲和偏向虚假之辈的，这人便为有福！
{Psa 40:5}  You have multiplied, O LORD my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us; none can compare with you! I will proclaim and tell of them, yet they are more than can be told.
{Psa 40:5}  耶和华我的神啊，你所行的奇事，并你向我们所怀的意念甚多，不能向你陈明；若要陈明，其事不可胜数。
{Psa 40:6}  In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.
{Psa 40:6}  祭物和礼物，你不喜悦；你已经开通我的耳朵。燔祭和赎罪祭非你所要。
{Psa 40:7}  Then I said, "Behold, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me:
{Psa 40:7}  那时我说：看哪，我来了！我的事在经卷上已经记载了。
{Psa 40:8}  I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart."
{Psa 40:8}  我的神啊，我乐意照你的旨意行；你的律法在我心里。
{Psa 40:9}  I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; behold, I have not restrained my lips, as you know, O LORD.
{Psa 40:9}  我在大会中宣传公义的佳音；我必不止住我的嘴唇。耶和华啊，这是你所知道的。
{Psa 40:10} I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart; I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation; I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation.
{Psa 40:10} 我未曾把你的公义藏在心里；我已陈明你的信实和你的救恩；我在大会中未曾隐瞒你的慈爱和诚实。
{Psa 40:11} As for you, O LORD, you will not restrain your mercy from me; your steadfast love and your faithfulness will ever preserve me!
{Psa 40:11} 耶和华啊，求你不要向我止住你的慈悲！愿你的慈爱和诚实常常保佑我！
{Psa 40:12} For evils have encompassed me beyond number; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me.
{Psa 40:12} 因有无数的祸患围困我，我的罪孽追上了我，使我不能昂首；这罪孽比我的头发还多，我就心寒胆战。
{Psa 40:13} Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me!
{Psa 40:13} 耶和华啊，求你开恩搭救我！耶和华啊，求你速速帮助我！
{Psa 40:14} Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether who seek to snatch away my life; let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt!
{Psa 40:14} 愿那些寻找我、要灭我命的，一同抱愧蒙羞！愿那些喜悦我受害的，退后受辱！
{Psa 40:15} Let those be appalled because of their shame who say to me, "Aha, Aha!"
{Psa 40:15} 愿那些对我说阿哈、阿哈的，因羞愧而败亡！
{Psa 40:16} But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation say continually, "Great is the LORD!"
{Psa 40:16} 愿一切寻求你的，因你高兴欢喜！愿那些喜爱你救恩的，常说：当尊耶和华为大！
{Psa 40:17} As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God!
{Psa 40:17} 但我是困苦穷乏的，主仍顾念我；你是帮助我的，搭救我的。神啊，求你不要耽延！
{Psa 41:1}  To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the LORD delivers him;
{Psa 41:1}  （大卫的诗，交与伶长。）眷顾贫穷的有福了！他遭难的日子，耶和华必搭救他。
{Psa 41:2}  the LORD protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; you do not give him up to the will of his enemies.
{Psa 41:2}  耶和华必保全他，使他存活；他必在地上享福。求你不要把他交给仇敌，遂其所愿。
{Psa 41:3}  The LORD sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness you restore him to full health.
{Psa 41:3}  他病重在榻，耶和华必扶持他；他在病中，你必给他铺床。
{Psa 41:4}  As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you!"
{Psa 41:4}  我曾说：耶和华啊，求你怜恤我，医治我！因为我得罪了你。
{Psa 41:5}  My enemies say of me in malice, "When will he die, and his name perish?"
{Psa 41:5}  我的仇敌用恶言议论我说：他几时死，他的名才灭亡呢？
{Psa 41:6}  And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, while his heart gathers iniquity; when he goes out, he tells it abroad.
{Psa 41:6}  他来看我就说假话；他心存奸恶，走到外边才说出来。
{Psa 41:7}  All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me.
{Psa 41:7}  一切恨我的，都交头接耳的议论我；他们设计要害我。
{Psa 41:8}  They say, "A deadly thing is poured out on him; he will not rise again from where he lies."
{Psa 41:8}  他们说：有怪病贴在他身上；他已躺卧，必不能再起来。
{Psa 41:9}  Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.
{Psa 41:9}  连我知己的朋友，我所倚靠、吃过我饭的也用脚踢我。
{Psa 41:10} But you, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them!
{Psa 41:10} 耶和华啊，求你怜恤我，使我起来，好报复他们！
{Psa 41:11} By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy will not shout in triumph over me.
{Psa 41:11} 因我的仇敌不得向我夸胜，我从此便知道你喜爱我。
{Psa 41:12} But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.
{Psa 41:12} 你因我纯正就扶持我，使我永远站在你的面前。
{Psa 41:13} Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.
{Psa 41:13} 耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的，从亘古直到永远。阿们！阿们！

{Psa 42:2}  我的心渴想神，就是永生神；我几时得朝见神呢？

{Psa 42:3}  我昼夜以眼泪当饮食；人不住的对我说：你的神在那里呢？

{Psa 42:4}  我从前与众人同往，用欢呼称赞的声音领他们到神的殿里，大家守节。我追想这些事，我的心极其悲伤。

{Psa 42:7}  你的瀑布发声，深渊就与深渊响应；你的波浪洪涛漫过我身。

{Psa 43:1}  神啊，求你伸我的冤，向不虔诚的国为我辨屈；求你救我脱离诡诈不义的人。

{Psa 43:2}  因为你是赐我力量的神，为何丢弃我呢？我为何因仇敌的欺压时常哀痛呢？

{Psa 44:1}  （可拉后裔的训诲诗，交与伶长。）神啊，你在古时，我们列祖的日子所行的事，我们亲耳听见了；我们的列祖也给我们述说过。
{Psa 44:2}  you with your own hand drove out the nations, but them you planted; you afflicted the peoples, but them you set free;
{Psa 44:2}  你曾用手赶出外邦人，却栽培了我们列祖；你苦待列邦，却叫我们列祖发达。
{Psa 44:3}  for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm save them, but your right hand and your arm, and the light of your face, for you delighted in them.
{Psa 44:3}  因为他们不是靠自己的刀剑得地土，也不是靠自己的膀臂得胜，乃是靠你的右手、你的膀臂，和你脸上的亮光，因为你喜悦他们。
{Psa 44:4}  You are my King, O God; ordain salvation for Jacob!
{Psa 44:4}  神啊，你是我的王；求你出令使雅各得胜。
{Psa 44:5}  Through you we push down our foes; through your name we tread down those who rise up against us.
{Psa 44:5}  我们靠你要推倒我们的敌人，靠你的名要践踏那起来攻击我们的人。
{Psa 44:6}  For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me.
{Psa 44:6}  因为，我必不靠我的弓；我的刀也不能使我得胜。
{Psa 44:7}  But you have saved us from our foes and have put to shame those who hate us.

{Psa 44:10} You have made us turn back from the foe, and those who hate us have gotten spoil.

{Psa 44:15} All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face
{Psa 44:15} 我的凌辱终日在我面前，我脸上的羞愧将我遮蔽，
{Psa 44:16} at the sound of the taunter and reviler, at the sight of the enemy and the avenger.
{Psa 44:16} 都因那辱骂毁谤人的声音，又因仇敌和报仇人的缘故。
{Psa 44:17} All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten you, and we have not been false to your covenant.
{Psa 44:17} 这都临到我们身上，我们却没有忘记你，也没有违背你的约。
{Psa 44:18} Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from your way;
{Psa 44:18} 我们的心没有退后；我们的脚也没有偏离你的路。
{Psa 44:19} yet you have broken us in the place of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death.
{Psa 44:19} 你在野狗之处压伤我们，用死荫遮蔽我们。
{Psa 44:20} If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
{Psa 44:20} 倘若我们忘了神的名，或向别神举手，
{Psa 44:21} would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
{Psa 44:21} 神岂不鉴察这事吗？因为他晓得人心里的隐秘。
{Psa 44:22} Yet for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.
{Psa 44:22} 我们为你的缘故终日被杀；人看我们如将宰的羊。
{Psa 44:23} Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever!
{Psa 44:23} 主啊，求你睡醒，为何尽睡呢？求你兴起，不要永远丢弃我们！
{Psa 44:24} Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our affliction and oppression?
{Psa 44:24} 你为何掩面，不顾我们所遭的苦难和所受的欺压？
{Psa 44:25} For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly clings to the ground.
{Psa 44:25} 我们的性命伏于尘土；我们的肚腹紧贴地面。
{Psa 44:26} Rise up; come to our help! Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love!
{Psa 44:26} 求你起来帮助我们！凭你的慈爱救赎我们！

{Psa 45:6}  神啊，你的宝座是永永远远的；你的国权是正直的。
{Psa 45:7}  you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions;
{Psa 45:7}  你喜爱公义，恨恶罪恶；所以神，就是你的神用喜乐油膏你，胜过膏你的同伴。
{Psa 45:8}  your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad;
{Psa 45:8}  你的衣服都有没药、沉香、肉桂的香气；象牙宫中有丝弦乐器的声音使你欢喜。

{Psa 45:9}  有君王的女儿在你尊贵妇女之中；王后佩戴俄斐金饰站在你右边。
{Psa 45:10} Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear: forget your people and your father's house,
{Psa 45:10} 女子啊，你要听，要想，要侧耳而听！不要记念你的民和你的父家，

{Psa 49:5}  在患难的日子，奸恶随我脚跟，四面环绕我，我何必惧怕？
{Psa 49:6}  those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?
{Psa 49:6}  那些倚仗财货自夸钱财多的人，
{Psa 49:7}  Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of his life,
{Psa 49:7}  一个也无法赎自己的弟兄，也不能替他将赎价给神，
{Psa 49:8}  for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice,
{Psa 49:8}  叫他长远活着，不见朽坏；因为赎他生命的价值极贵，只可永远罢休。
{Psa 49:9}  that he should live on forever and never see the pit.
{Psa 49:9}  (SEE 49:8)
{Psa 49:10} For he sees that even the wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others.

{Psa 49:17} For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him.
{Psa 49:17} 因为，他死的时候什么也不能带去；他的荣耀不能随他下去。
{Psa 49:18} For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed --and though you get praise when you do well for yourself--

{Psa 50:20} You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.
{Psa 50:20} 你坐着毁谤你的兄弟，谗毁你亲母的儿子。

{Psa 52:1}  To the choirmaster. A Maskil of David, when Doeg, the Edomite, came and told Saul, "David has come to the house of Ahimelech." Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The steadfast love of God endures all the day.
{Psa 52:1}  （以东人多益来告诉扫罗说：“大卫到了亚希米勒家。”那时，大卫作这训诲诗，交与伶长。）勇士啊，你为何以作恶自夸？神的慈爱是常存的。
{Psa 52:2}  Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit.
{Psa 52:2}  你的舌头邪恶诡诈，好像剃头刀，快利伤人。

{Psa 52:4}  You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.
{Psa 52:4}  诡诈的舌头啊，你爱说一切毁灭的话！
{Psa 52:5}  But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah.
{Psa 52:5}  神也要毁灭你，直到永远；他要把你拿去，从你的帐棚中抽出，从活人之地将你拔出。（细拉）
{Psa 52:6}  The righteous shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,
{Psa 52:6}  义人要看见而惧怕，并要笑他，
{Psa 52:7}  "See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge in his own destruction!"
{Psa 52:7}  说：看哪，这就是那不以神为他力量的人，只倚仗他丰富的财物，在邪恶上坚立自己。

{Psa 53:1}  （大卫的训诲诗，交与伶长。调用麻哈拉。）愚顽人心里说：没有神。他们都是邪恶，行了可憎恶的罪孽；没有一个人行善。
{Psa 53:2}  God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.
{Psa 53:2}  神从天上垂看世人，要看有明白的没有？有寻求他的没有？
{Psa 53:3}  They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.
{Psa 53:3}  他们各人都退后，一同变为污秽；并没有行善的，连一个也没有。
{Psa 53:4}  Have those who work evil no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God?
{Psa 53:4}  作孽的没有知识吗？他们吞吃我的百姓如同吃饭一样，并不求告神。
{Psa 53:5}  There they are, in great terror, where there is no terror! For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against you; you put them to shame, for God has rejected them.
{Psa 53:5}  他们在无可惧怕之处就大大害怕，因为神把那安营攻击你之人的骨头散开了。你使他们蒙羞，因为神弃绝了他们。
{Psa 53:6}  Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
{Psa 53:6}  但愿以色列的救恩从锡安而出。神救回他被掳的子民那时，雅各要快乐，以色列要欢喜。

{Psa 54:1}  （西弗人来对扫罗说：“大卫岂不是在我们那里藏身吗？”那时，大卫作这训诲诗，交与伶长。用丝弦的乐器。）神啊，求你以你的名救我，凭你的大能为我伸冤。
{Psa 54:2}  O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
{Psa 54:2}  神啊，求你听我的祷告，留心听我口中的言语。
{Psa 54:3}  For strangers have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves. Selah.
{Psa 54:3}  因为，外人起来攻击我，强暴人寻索我的命；他们眼中没有神。（细拉）
{Psa 54:4}  Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.
{Psa 54:4}  神是帮助我的，是扶持我命的。
{Psa 54:5}  He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them.
{Psa 54:5}  他要报应我仇敌所行的恶；求你凭你的诚实灭绝他们。
{Psa 54:6}  With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O LORD, for it is good.
{Psa 54:6}  我要把甘心祭献给你。耶和华啊，我要称赞你的名；这名本为美好。
{Psa 54:7}  For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
{Psa 54:7}  他从一切的急难中把我救出来；我的眼睛也看见了我仇敌遭报。
{Psa 55:1}  To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy!
{Psa 55:1}  （大卫的训诲诗，交与伶长。用丝弦的乐器。）神啊，求你留心听我的祷告，不要隐藏不听我的恳求！
{Psa 55:2}  Attend to me, and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and I moan,
{Psa 55:2}  求你侧耳听我，应允我。我哀叹不安，发声唉哼，
{Psa 55:3}  because of the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they drop trouble upon me, and in anger they bear a grudge against me.
{Psa 55:3}  都因仇敌的声音，恶人的欺压；因为他们将罪孽加在我身上，发怒气逼迫我。
{Psa 55:4}  My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
{Psa 55:4}  我心在我里面甚是疼痛；死的惊惶临到我身。
{Psa 55:5}  Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.
{Psa 55:5}  恐惧战兢归到我身；惊恐漫过了我。
{Psa 55:6}  And I say, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest;
{Psa 55:6}  我说：但愿我有翅膀像鸽子，我就飞去，得享安息。
{Psa 55:7}  yes, I would wander far away; I would lodge in the wilderness; Selah.
{Psa 55:7}  我必远游，宿在旷野。（细拉）
{Psa 55:8}  I would hurry to find a shelter from the raging wind and tempest."
{Psa 55:8}  我必速速逃到避所，脱离狂风暴雨。
{Psa 55:9}  Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongues; for I see violence and strife in the city.
{Psa 55:9}  主啊，求你吞灭他们，变乱他们的舌头！因为我在城中见了强暴争竞的事。
{Psa 55:10} Day and night they go around it on its walls, and iniquity and trouble are within it;
{Psa 55:10} 他们在城墙上昼夜绕行；在城内也有罪孽和奸恶。
{Psa 55:11} ruin is in its midst; oppression and fraud do not depart from its marketplace.
{Psa 55:11} 邪恶在其中；欺压和诡诈不离街市。
{Psa 55:12} For it is not an enemy who taunts me-- then I could bear it; it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me-- then I could hide from him.
{Psa 55:12} 原来不是仇敌辱骂我，若是仇敌，还可忍耐；也不是恨我的人向我狂大，若是恨我的人就必躲避他。
{Psa 55:13} But it is you, a man, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend.
{Psa 55:13} 不料是你；你原与我平等，是我的同伴，是我知己的朋友！
{Psa 55:14} We used to take sweet counsel together; within God's house we walked in the throng.
{Psa 55:14} 我们素常彼此谈论，以为甘甜；我们与群众在神的殿中同行。
{Psa 55:15} Let death steal over them; let them go down to Sheol alive; for evil is in their dwelling place and in their heart.
{Psa 55:15} 愿死亡忽然临到他们！愿他们活活的下入阴间！因为他们的住处，他们的心中，都是邪恶。
{Psa 55:16} But I call to God, and the LORD will save me.
{Psa 55:16} 至于我，我要求告神；耶和华必拯救我。
{Psa 55:17} Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint and moan, and he hears my voice.
{Psa 55:17} 我要晚上、早晨、晌午哀声悲叹；他也必听我的声音。
{Psa 55:18} He redeems my soul in safety from the battle that I wage, for many are arrayed against me.
{Psa 55:18} 他救赎我命脱离攻击我的人，使我得享平安，因为与我相争的人甚多。
{Psa 55:19} God will give ear and humble them, he who is enthroned from of old, Selah. because they do not change and do not fear God.
{Psa 55:19} 那没有更变、不敬畏神的人，从太古常存的神必听见而苦待他。
{Psa 55:20} My companion stretched out his hand against his friends; he violated his covenant.
{Psa 55:20} 他背了约，伸手攻击与他和好的人。
{Psa 55:21} His speech was smooth as butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
{Psa 55:21} 他的口如奶油光滑，他的心却怀着争战；他的话比油柔和，其实是拔出来的刀。
{Psa 55:22} Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved.
{Psa 55:22} 你要把你的重担卸给耶和华，他必抚养你；他永不叫义人动摇。

{Psa 71:8}  你的赞美，你的荣耀终日必满了我的口。
{Psa 71:9}  Do not cast me off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength is spent.
{Psa 71:9}  我年老的时候，求你不要丢弃我！我力气衰弱的时候，求你不要离弃我！
{Psa 71:10} For my enemies speak concerning me; those who watch for my life consult together
{Psa 71:10} 我的仇敌议论我；那些窥探要害我命的彼此商议，
{Psa 71:11} and say, "God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver him."
{Psa 71:11} 说：神已经离弃他；我们追赶他，捉拿他吧！因为没有人搭救。
{Psa 71:12} O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me!
{Psa 71:12} 神啊，求你不要远离我！我的神啊，求你速速帮助我！
{Psa 71:13} May my accusers be put to shame and consumed; with scorn and disgrace may they be covered who seek my hurt.
{Psa 71:13} 愿那与我性命为敌的，羞愧被灭；愿那谋害我的，受辱蒙羞。
{Psa 71:14} But I will hope continually and will praise you yet more and more.
{Psa 71:14} 我却要常常盼望，并要越发赞美你。
{Psa 71:15} My mouth will tell of your righteous acts, of your deeds of salvation all the day, for their number is past my knowledge.
{Psa 71:15} 我的口终日要述说你的公义和你的救恩，因我不计其数。
{Psa 71:16} With the mighty deeds of the Lord GOD I will come; I will remind them of your righteousness, yours alone.
{Psa 71:16} 我要来说主耶和华大能的事；我单要提说你的公义。
{Psa 71:17} O God, from my youth you have taught me, and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.
{Psa 71:17} 神啊，自我年幼时，你就教训我；直到如今，我传扬你奇妙的作为。
{Psa 71:18} So even to old age and gray hairs, O God, do not forsake me, until I proclaim your might to another generation, your power to all those to come.
{Psa 71:18} 神啊，我到年老发白的时候，求你不要离弃我！等我将你的能力指示下代，将你的大能指示后世的人。
{Psa 71:19} Your righteousness, O God, reaches the high heavens. You who have done great things, O God, who is like you?
{Psa 71:19} 神啊，你的公义甚高；行过大事的神啊，谁能像你！
{Psa 71:20} You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again; from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.
{Psa 71:20} 你是叫我们多经历重大急难的，必使我们复活，从地的深处救上来。
{Psa 71:21} You will increase my greatness and comfort me again.
{Psa 71:21} 求你使我越发昌大，又转来安慰我。
{Psa 71:22} I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
{Psa 71:22} 我的神啊，我要鼓瑟称赞你，称赞你的诚实！以色列的圣者啊，我要弹琴歌颂你！
{Psa 71:23} My lips will shout for joy, when I sing praises to you; my soul also, which you have redeemed.
{Psa 71:23} 我歌颂你的时候，我的嘴唇和你所赎我的灵魂都必欢呼；
{Psa 71:24} And my tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long, for they have been put to shame and disappointed who sought to do me hurt.
{Psa 71:24} 并且我的舌头必终日讲论你的公义，因为那些谋害我的人已经蒙羞受辱了。
{Psa 72:1}  Of Solomon. Give the king your justice, O God, and your righteousness to the royal son!
{Psa 72:1}  （所罗门的诗。）神啊，求你将判断的权柄赐给王，将公义赐给王的儿子。

{Psa 72:7}  In his days may the righteous flourish, and peace abound, till the moon be no more!
{Psa 72:7}  在他的日子，义人要发旺，大有平安，好像月亮长存。
{Psa 72:8}  May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!
{Psa 72:8}  他要执掌权柄，从这海直到那海，从大河直到地极。
{Psa 72:9}  May desert tribes bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust!
{Psa 72:9}  住在旷野的，必在他面前下拜；他的仇敌必要舔土。
{Psa 72:10} May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts!

{Psa 72:12} For he delivers the needy when he calls, the poor and him who has no helper.
{Psa 72:12} 因为，穷乏人呼求的时候，他要搭救；没有人帮助的困苦人，他也要搭救。
{Psa 72:13} He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the needy.
{Psa 72:13} 他要怜恤贫寒和穷乏的人，拯救穷苦人的性命。

{Psa 72:14} 他要救赎他们脱离欺压和强暴；他们的血在他眼中看为宝贵。
{Psa 72:15} Long may he live; may gold of Sheba be given to him! May prayer be made for him continually, and blessings invoked for him all the day!
{Psa 72:15} 他们要存活。示巴的金子要奉给他；人要常常为他祷告，终日称颂他。
{Psa 72:16} May there be abundance of grain in the land; on the tops of the mountains may it wave; may its fruit be like Lebanon; and may people blossom in the cities like the grass of the field!
{Psa 72:16} 在地的山顶上，五谷必然茂盛（或作：有一把五谷）；所结的谷实要响动，如利巴嫩的树林；城里的人要发旺，如地上的草。
{Psa 72:17} May his name endure forever, his fame continue as long as the sun! May people be blessed in him, all nations call him blessed!
{Psa 72:17} 他的名要存到永远，要留传如日之久。人要因他蒙福；万国要称他有福。

{Psa 72:20} The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.
{Psa 72:20} 耶西的儿子大卫的祈祷完毕。
{Psa 73:1}  A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
{Psa 73:1}  （亚萨的诗。）神实在恩待以色列那些清心的人！
{Psa 73:2}  But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, my steps had nearly slipped.
{Psa 73:2}  至于我，我的脚几乎失闪；我的脚险些滑跌。
{Psa 73:3}  For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
{Psa 73:3}  我见恶人和狂傲人享平安就心怀不平。
{Psa 73:4}  For they have no pangs until death; their bodies are fat and sleek.
{Psa 73:4}  他们死的时候没有疼痛；他们的力气却也壮实。
{Psa 73:5}  They are not in trouble as others are; they are not stricken like the rest of mankind.
{Psa 73:5}  他们不像别人受苦，也不像别人遭灾。
{Psa 73:6}  Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them as a garment.
{Psa 73:6}  所以，骄傲如链子戴在他们的项上；强暴像衣裳遮住他们的身体。
{Psa 73:7}  Their eyes swell out through fatness; their hearts overflow with follies.
{Psa 73:7}  他们的眼睛因体胖而凸出；他们所得的，过于心里所想的。
{Psa 73:8}  They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression.
{Psa 73:8}  他们讥笑人，凭恶意说欺压人的话；他们说话自高。
{Psa 73:9}  They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth.
{Psa 73:9}  他们的口亵渎上天；他们的舌毁谤全地。
{Psa 73:10} Therefore his people turn back to them, and find no fault in them.
{Psa 73:10} 所以神的民归到这里，喝尽了满杯的苦水。
{Psa 73:11} And they say, "How can God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"
{Psa 73:11} 他们说：神怎能晓得？至高者岂有知识呢？
{Psa 73:12} Behold, these are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches.
{Psa 73:12} 看哪，这就是恶人；他们既是常享安逸，财宝便加增。
{Psa 73:13} All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence.
{Psa 73:13} 我实在徒然洁净了我的心，徒然洗手表明无辜。
{Psa 73:14} For all the day long I have been stricken and rebuked every morning.
{Psa 73:14} 因为，我终日遭灾难；每早晨受惩治。
{Psa 73:15} If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed the generation of your children.
{Psa 73:15} 我若说，我要这样讲，这就是以奸诈待你的众子。
{Psa 73:16} But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task,
{Psa 73:16} 我思索怎能明白这事，眼看实系为难，
{Psa 73:17} until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I discerned their end.
{Psa 73:17} 等我进了神的圣所，思想他们的结局。
{Psa 73:18} Truly you set them in slippery places; you make them fall to ruin.
{Psa 73:18} 你实在把他们安在滑地，使他们掉在沉沦之中。
{Psa 73:19} How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors!
{Psa 73:19} 他们转眼之间成了何等的荒凉！他们被惊恐灭尽了。
{Psa 73:20} Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when you rouse yourself, you despise them as phantoms.
{Psa 73:20} 人睡醒了，怎样看梦；主啊，你醒了也必照样轻看他们的影像。
{Psa 73:21} When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart,
{Psa 73:21} 因而，我心里发酸，肺腑被刺。
{Psa 73:22} I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you.
{Psa 73:22} 我这样愚昧无知，在你面前如畜类一般。
{Psa 73:23} Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand.
{Psa 73:23} 然而，我常与你同在；你搀着我的右手。
{Psa 73:24} You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory.
{Psa 73:24} 你要以你的训言引导我，以后必接我到荣耀里。
{Psa 73:25} Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
{Psa 73:25} 除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。
{Psa 73:26} My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
{Psa 73:26} 我的肉体和我的心肠衰残；但神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。
{Psa 73:27} For behold, those who are far from you shall perish; you put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you.
{Psa 73:27} 远离你的，必要死亡；凡离弃你行邪淫的，你都灭绝了。
{Psa 73:28} But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
{Psa 73:28} 但我亲近神是与我有益；我以主耶和华为我的避难所，好叫我述说你一切的作为。
{Psa 74:1}  A Maskil of Asaph. O God, why do you cast us off forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?
{Psa 74:1}  （亚萨的训诲诗。）神啊，你为何永远丢弃我们呢？你为何向你草场的羊发怒，如烟冒出呢？
{Psa 74:2}  Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your heritage! Remember Mount Zion, where you have dwelt.
{Psa 74:2}  求你记念你古时所得来的会众，就是你所赎作你产业支派的，并记念你向来所居住的锡安山。
{Psa 74:3}  Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins; the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary!
{Psa 74:3}  求你举步去看那日久荒凉之地，仇敌在圣所中所行的一切恶事。
{Psa 74:4}  Your foes have roared in the midst of your meeting place; they set up their own signs for signs.
{Psa 74:4}  你的敌人在你会中吼叫；他们竖了自己的旗为记号。
{Psa 74:5}  They were like those who swing axes in a forest of trees.
{Psa 74:5}  他们好像人扬起斧子，砍伐林中的树。
{Psa 74:6}  And all its carved wood they broke down with hatchets and hammers.
{Psa 74:6}  圣所中一切雕刻的，他们现在用斧子锤子打坏了。
{Psa 74:7}  They set your sanctuary on fire; they profaned the dwelling place of your name, bringing it down to the ground.
{Psa 74:7}  他们用火焚烧你的圣所，亵渎你名的居所，拆毁到地。
{Psa 74:8}  They said to themselves, "We will utterly subdue them"; they burned all the meeting places of God in the land.
{Psa 74:8}  他们心里说：我们要尽行毁灭；他们就在遍地把神的会所都烧毁了。
{Psa 74:9}  We do not see our signs; there is no longer any prophet, and there is none among us who knows how long.
{Psa 74:9}  我们不见我们的标帜，不再有先知；我们内中也没有人知道这灾祸要到几时呢！
{Psa 74:10} How long, O God, is the foe to scoff? Is the enemy to revile your name forever?
{Psa 74:10} 神啊，敌人辱骂要到几时呢？仇敌亵渎你的名要到永远吗？
{Psa 74:11} Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the fold of your garment and destroy them!
{Psa 74:11} 你为什么缩回你的右手？求你从怀中伸出来，毁灭他们。
{Psa 74:12} Yet God my King is from of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
{Psa 74:12} 神自古以来为我的王，在地上施行拯救。
{Psa 74:13} You divided the sea by your might; you broke the heads of the sea monsters on the waters.
{Psa 74:13} 你曾用能力将海分开，将水中大鱼的头打破。
{Psa 74:14} You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.
{Psa 74:14} 你曾砸碎鳄鱼的头，把他给旷野的禽兽（禽兽：原文作民）为食物。
{Psa 74:15} You split open springs and brooks; you dried up ever-flowing streams.
{Psa 74:15} 你曾分裂磐石，水便成了溪河；你使长流的江河干了。
{Psa 74:16} Yours is the day, yours also the night; you have established the heavenly lights and the sun.
{Psa 74:16} 白昼属你，黑夜也属你；亮光和日头是你所预备的。
{Psa 74:17} You have fixed all the boundaries of the earth; you have made summer and winter.
{Psa 74:17} 地的一切疆界是你所立的；夏天和冬天是你所定的。
{Psa 74:18} Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy scoffs, and a foolish people reviles your name.
{Psa 74:18} 耶和华啊，仇敌辱骂，愚顽民亵渎了你的名，求你记念这事。
{Psa 74:19} Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild beasts; do not forget the life of your poor forever.
{Psa 74:19} 不要将你斑鸠的性命交给野兽；不要永远忘记你困苦人的性命。
{Psa 74:20} Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.
{Psa 74:20} 求你顾念所立的约，因为地上黑暗之处都满了强暴的居所。
{Psa 74:21} Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.
{Psa 74:21} 不要叫受欺压的人蒙羞回去；要叫困苦穷乏的人赞美你的名。
{Psa 74:22} Arise, O God, defend your cause; remember how the foolish scoff at you all the day!
{Psa 74:22} 神啊，求你起来为自己伸诉！要记念愚顽人怎样终日辱骂你。
{Psa 74:23} Do not forget the clamor of your foes, the uproar of those who rise against you, which goes up continually!
{Psa 74:23} 不要忘记你敌人的声音；那起来敌你之人的喧哗时常上升。
{Psa 75:1}  To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your name is near. We recount your wondrous deeds.
{Psa 75:1}  （亚萨的诗歌，交与伶长。调用休要毁坏。）神啊，我们称谢你，我们称谢你！因为你的名相近，人都述说你奇妙的作为。
{Psa 75:2}  "At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity.
{Psa 75:2}  我到了所定的日期，必按正直施行审判。
{Psa 75:3}  When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah.
{Psa 75:3}  地和其上的居民都消化了；我曾立了地的柱子。（细拉）
{Psa 75:4}  I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horn;
{Psa 75:4}  我对狂傲人说：不要行事狂傲！对凶恶人说：不要举角！
{Psa 75:5}  do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck.'"
{Psa 75:5}  不要把你们的角高举；不要挺着颈项说话。
{Psa 75:6}  For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up,
{Psa 75:6}  因为高举非从东，非从西，也非从南而来。
{Psa 75:7}  but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another.
{Psa 75:7}  惟有神断定；他使这人降卑，使那人升高。
{Psa 75:8}  For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.
{Psa 75:8}  耶和华手里有杯，其中的酒起沫，杯内满了搀杂的酒；他倒出来，地上的恶人必都喝这酒的渣滓，而且喝尽。
{Psa 75:9}  But I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
{Psa 75:9}  但我要宣扬，直到永远！我要歌颂雅各的神！

{Psa 75:10} 恶人一切的角，我要砍断；惟有义人的角必被高举。
{Psa 76:1}  To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel.
{Psa 76:1}  （亚萨的诗歌，交与伶长。用丝弦的乐器。）在犹大，神为人所认识；在以色列，他的名为大。
{Psa 76:2}  His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.
{Psa 76:2}  在撒冷有他的帐幕；在锡安有他的居所。
{Psa 76:3}  There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.

{Psa 76:4}  Glorious are you, more majestic than the mountains full of prey.
{Psa 76:4}  你从有野食之山而来，有光华和荣美。
{Psa 76:5}  The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; they sank into sleep; all the men of war were unable to use their hands.
{Psa 76:5}  心中勇敢的人都被抢夺；他们睡了长觉，没有一个英雄能措手。

{Psa 76:6}  雅各的神啊，你的斥责一发，坐车的，骑马的都沉睡了。

{Psa 76:7}  惟独你是可畏的！你怒气一发，谁能在你面前站得住呢？
{Psa 76:8}  From the heavens you uttered judgment; the earth feared and was still,
{Psa 76:8}  你从天上使人听判断。神起来施行审判，要救地上一切谦卑的人；那时地就惧怕而静默。（细拉）
{Psa 76:9}  when God arose to establish judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah.
{Psa 76:9}  (SEE 76:8)
{Psa 76:10} Surely the wrath of man shall praise you; the remnant of wrath you will put on like a belt.
{Psa 76:10} 人的忿怒要成全你的荣美；人的余怒，你要禁止。
{Psa 76:11} Make your vows to the LORD your God and perform them; let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared,
{Psa 76:11} 你们许愿，当向耶和华你们的神还愿；在他四面的人都当拿贡物献给那可畏的主。
{Psa 76:12} who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is to be feared by the kings of the earth.
{Psa 76:12} 他要挫折王子的骄气；他向地上的君王显威可畏。
{Psa 77:1}  To the choirmaster: according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and he will hear me.
{Psa 77:1}  （亚萨的诗，照耶杜顿的作法，交与伶长。）我要向神发声呼求；我向神发声，他必留心听我。
{Psa 77:2}  In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted.
{Psa 77:2}  我在患难之日寻求主；我在夜间不住的举手祷告；我的心不肯受安慰。
{Psa 77:3}  When I remember God, I moan; when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah.
{Psa 77:3}  我想念神，就烦燥不安；我沉吟悲伤，心便发昏。（细拉）
{Psa 77:4}  You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
{Psa 77:4}  你叫我不能闭眼；我烦乱不安，甚至不能说话。
{Psa 77:5}  I consider the days of old, the years long ago.
{Psa 77:5}  我追想古时之日，上古之年。
{Psa 77:6}  I said, "Let me remember my song in the night; let me meditate in my heart." Then my spirit made a diligent search:
{Psa 77:6}  我想起我夜间的歌曲，扪心自问；我心里也仔细省察。
{Psa 77:7}  "Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable?
{Psa 77:7}  难道主要永远丢弃我，不再施恩吗？
{Psa 77:8}  Has his steadfast love forever ceased? Are his promises at an end for all time?
{Psa 77:8}  难道他的慈爱永远穷尽，他的应许世世废弃吗？
{Psa 77:9}  Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?" Selah.
{Psa 77:9}  难道神忘记开恩，因发怒就止住他的慈悲吗？（细拉）
{Psa 77:10} Then I said, "I will appeal to this, to the years of the right hand of the Most High."
{Psa 77:10} 我便说：这是我的懦弱，但我要追念至高者显出右手之年代。
{Psa 77:11} I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your wonders of old.
{Psa 77:11} 我要提说耶和华所行的；我要记念你古时的奇事。
{Psa 77:12} I will ponder all your work, and meditate on your mighty deeds.
{Psa 77:12} 我也要思想你的经营，默念你的作为。
{Psa 77:13} Your way, O God, is holy. What god is great like our God?
{Psa 77:13} 神啊，你的作为是洁净的；有何神大如神呢？
{Psa 77:14} You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples.
{Psa 77:14} 你是行奇事的神；你曾在列邦中彰显你的能力。
{Psa 77:15} You with your arm redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
{Psa 77:15} 你曾用你的膀臂赎了你的民，就是雅各和约瑟的子孙。（细拉）
{Psa 77:16} When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; indeed, the deep trembled.
{Psa 77:16} 神啊，诸水见你，一见就都惊惶；深渊也都战抖。
{Psa 77:17} The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth thunder; your arrows flashed on every side.
{Psa 77:17} 云中倒出水来；天空发出响声；你的箭也飞行四方。
{Psa 77:18} The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
{Psa 77:18} 你的雷声在旋风中；电光照亮世界；大地战抖震动。
{Psa 77:19} Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen.
{Psa 77:19} 你的道在海中；你的路在大水中；你的脚踪无人知道。
{Psa 77:20} You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
{Psa 77:20} 你曾藉摩西和亚伦的手引导你的百姓，好像羊群一般。
{Psa 78:1}  A Maskil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth!
{Psa 78:1}  （亚萨的训诲诗。）我的民哪，你们要留心听我的训诲，侧耳听我口中的话。
{Psa 78:2}  I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old,
{Psa 78:2}  我要开口说比喻；我要说出古时的谜语，
{Psa 78:3}  things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us.
{Psa 78:3}  是我们所听见、所知道的，也是我们的祖宗告诉我们的。
{Psa 78:4}  We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, and the wonders that he has done.
{Psa 78:4}  我们不将这些事向他们的子孙隐瞒，要将耶和华的美德和他的能力，并他奇妙的作为，述说给后代听。
{Psa 78:5}  He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children,
{Psa 78:5}  因为，他在雅各中立法度，在以色列中设律法；是他吩咐我们祖宗要传给子孙的，
{Psa 78:6}  that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children,
{Psa 78:6}  使将要生的后代子孙可以晓得；他们也要起来告诉他们的子孙，
{Psa 78:7}  so that they should set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;
{Psa 78:7}  好叫他们仰望神，不忘记神的作为，惟要守他的命令。
{Psa 78:8}  and that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God.
{Psa 78:8}  不要像他们的祖宗，是顽梗悖逆、居心不正之辈，向着神，心不诚实。
{Psa 78:9}  The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle.
{Psa 78:9}  以法莲的子孙带着兵器，拿着弓，临阵之日转身退后。
{Psa 78:10} They did not keep God's covenant, but refused to walk according to his law.
{Psa 78:10} 他们不遵守神的约，不肯照他的律法行；
{Psa 78:11} They forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them.
{Psa 78:11} 又忘记他所行的和他显给他们奇妙的作为。
{Psa 78:12} In the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.
{Psa 78:12} 他在埃及地，在琐安田，在他们祖宗的眼前施行奇事。
{Psa 78:13} He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap.
{Psa 78:13} 他将海分裂，使他们过去，又叫水立起如垒。
{Psa 78:14} In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light.
{Psa 78:14} 他白日用云彩，终夜用火光引导他们。
{Psa 78:15} He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.
{Psa 78:15} 他在旷野分裂磐石，多多的给他们水喝，如从深渊而出。
{Psa 78:16} He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers.
{Psa 78:16} 他使水从磐石涌出，叫水如江河下流。
{Psa 78:17} Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
{Psa 78:17} 他们却仍旧得罪他，在干燥之地悖逆至高者。
{Psa 78:18} They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved.
{Psa 78:18} 他们心中试探神，随自己所欲的求食物，
{Psa 78:19} They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?
{Psa 78:19} 并且妄论神说：神在旷野岂能摆设筵席吗？
{Psa 78:20} He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?"
{Psa 78:20} 他曾击打磐石，使水涌出，成了江河；他还能赐粮食吗？还能为他的百姓预备肉吗？
{Psa 78:21} Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel,
{Psa 78:21} 所以，耶和华听见就发怒；有烈火向雅各烧起；有怒气向以色列上腾；
{Psa 78:22} because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.
{Psa 78:22} 因为他们不信服神，不倚赖他的救恩。
{Psa 78:23} Yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven,
{Psa 78:23} 他却吩咐天空，又敞开天上的门，
{Psa 78:24} and he rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven.
{Psa 78:24} 降吗哪，像雨给他们吃，将天上的粮食赐给他们。
{Psa 78:25} Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance.
{Psa 78:25} 各人（或作：人）吃大能者的食物；他赐下粮食，使他们饱足。
{Psa 78:26} He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;
{Psa 78:26} 他领东风起在天空，又用能力引了南风来。
{Psa 78:27} he rained meat on them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;
{Psa 78:27} 他降肉，像雨在他们当中，多如尘土，又降飞鸟，多如海沙，
{Psa 78:28} he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.
{Psa 78:28} 落在他们的营中，在他们住处的四面。
{Psa 78:29} And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.
{Psa 78:29} 他们吃了，而且饱足；这样就随了他们所欲的。
{Psa 78:30} But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,
{Psa 78:30} 他们贪而无厌，食物还在他们口中的时候，
{Psa 78:31} the anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel.
{Psa 78:31} 神的怒气就向他们上腾，杀了他们内中的肥壮人，打倒以色列的少年人。
{Psa 78:32} In spite of all this, they still sinned; despite his wonders, they did not believe.
{Psa 78:32} 虽是这样，他们仍旧犯罪，不信他奇妙的作为。
{Psa 78:33} So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.
{Psa 78:33} 因此，他叫他们的日子全归虚空，叫他们的年岁尽属惊恐。
{Psa 78:34} When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and sought God earnestly.
{Psa 78:34} 他杀他们的时候，他们才求问他，回心转意，切切的寻求神。
{Psa 78:35} They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.
{Psa 78:35} 他们也追念神是他们的磐石，至高的神是他们的救赎主。
{Psa 78:36} But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.
{Psa 78:36} 他们却用口谄媚他，用舌向他说谎。
{Psa 78:37} Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not faithful to his covenant.
{Psa 78:37} 因他们的心向他不正，在他的约上也不忠心。
{Psa 78:38} Yet he, being compassionate, atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them; he restrained his anger often and did not stir up all his wrath.
{Psa 78:38} 但他有怜悯，赦免他们的罪孽，不灭绝他们，而且屡次消他的怒气，不发尽他的忿怒。
{Psa 78:39} He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again.
{Psa 78:39} 他想到他们不过是血气，是一阵去而不返的风。
{Psa 78:40} How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!
{Psa 78:40} 他们在旷野悖逆他，在荒地叫他担忧，何其多呢！
{Psa 78:41} They tested God again and again and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
{Psa 78:41} 他们再三试探神，惹动以色列的圣者。
{Psa 78:42} They did not remember his power or the day when he redeemed them from the foe,
{Psa 78:42} 他们不追念他的能力（原文作手）和赎他们脱离敌人的日子；
{Psa 78:43} when he performed his signs in Egypt and his marvels in the fields of Zoan.
{Psa 78:43} 他怎样在埃及地显神迹，在琐安田显奇事，
{Psa 78:44} He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.
{Psa 78:44} 把他们的江河并河汊的水都变为血，使他们不能喝。
{Psa 78:45} He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.
{Psa 78:45} 他叫苍蝇成群落在他们当中，嘬尽他们，又叫青蛙灭了他们，
{Psa 78:46} He gave their crops to the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
{Psa 78:46} 把他们的土产交给蚂蚱，把他们辛苦得来的交给蝗虫。
{Psa 78:47} He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost.
{Psa 78:47} 他降冰雹打坏他们的葡萄树，下严霜打坏他们的桑树，
{Psa 78:48} He gave over their cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts.
{Psa 78:48} 又把他们的牲畜交给冰雹，把他们的群畜交给闪电。
{Psa 78:49} He let loose on them his burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.
{Psa 78:49} 他使猛烈的怒气和忿怒、恼恨、苦难成了一群降灾的使者，临到他们。
{Psa 78:50} He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.
{Psa 78:50} 他为自己的怒气修平了路，将他们交给瘟疫，使他们死亡，
{Psa 78:51} He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
{Psa 78:51} 在埃及击杀一切长子，在含的帐棚中击杀他们强壮时头生的。
{Psa 78:52} Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
{Psa 78:52} 他却领出自己的民如羊，在旷野引他们如羊群。
{Psa 78:53} He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
{Psa 78:53} 他领他们稳稳妥妥的，使他们不至害怕；海却淹没他们的仇敌。
{Psa 78:54} And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won.
{Psa 78:54} 他带他们到自己圣地的边界，到他右手所得的这山地。
{Psa 78:55} He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
{Psa 78:55} 他在他们面前赶出外邦人，用绳子将外邦的地量给他们为业，叫以色列支派的人住在他们的帐棚里。
{Psa 78:56} Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies,
{Psa 78:56} 他们仍旧试探、悖逆至高的神，不守他的法度，
{Psa 78:57} but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow.
{Psa 78:57} 反倒退后，行诡诈，像他们的祖宗一样；他们改变，如同翻背的弓。
{Psa 78:58} For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.
{Psa 78:58} 因他们的邱坛惹了他的怒气；因他们雕刻的偶像触动他的愤恨。
{Psa 78:59} When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.
{Psa 78:59} 神听见就发怒，极其憎恶以色列人。
{Psa 78:60} He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mankind,
{Psa 78:60} 甚至他离弃示罗的帐幕，就是他在人间所搭的帐棚；
{Psa 78:61} and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.
{Psa 78:61} 又将他的约柜（原文作能力）交与人掳去，将他的荣耀交在敌人手中；
{Psa 78:62} He gave his people over to the sword and vented his wrath on his heritage.
{Psa 78:62} 并将他的百姓交与刀剑，向他的产业发怒。
{Psa 78:63} Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no marriage song.
{Psa 78:63} 少年人被火烧灭；处女也无喜歌。
{Psa 78:64} Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.
{Psa 78:64} 祭司倒在刀下，寡妇却不哀哭。
{Psa 78:65} Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine.
{Psa 78:65} 那时，主像世人睡醒，像勇士饮酒呼喊。
{Psa 78:66} And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame.
{Psa 78:66} 他就打退了他的敌人，叫他们永蒙羞辱；
{Psa 78:67} He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
{Psa 78:67} 并且他弃掉约瑟的帐棚，不拣选以法莲支派，
{Psa 78:68} but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.
{Psa 78:68} 却拣选犹大支派他所喜爱的锡安山；
{Psa 78:69} He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever.
{Psa 78:69} 盖造他的圣所，好像高峰，又像他建立永存之地；
{Psa 78:70} He chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds;
{Psa 78:70} 又拣选他的仆人大卫，从羊圈中将他召来，
{Psa 78:71} from following the nursing ewes he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance.
{Psa 78:71} 叫他不再跟从那些带奶的母羊，为要牧养自己的百姓雅各和自己的产业以色列。
{Psa 78:72} With upright heart he shepherded them and guided them with his skillful hand.
{Psa 78:72} 于是，他按心中的纯正牧养他们，用手中的巧妙引导他们。
{Psa 79:1}  A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
{Psa 79:1}  （亚萨的诗。）神啊，外邦人进入你的产业，污秽你的圣殿，使耶路撒冷变成荒堆，
{Psa 79:2}  They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the heavens for food, the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth.
{Psa 79:2}  把你仆人的尸首交与天空的飞鸟为食，把你圣民的肉交与地上的野兽，
{Psa 79:3}  They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.
{Psa 79:3}  在耶路撒冷周围流他们的血如水，无人葬埋。
{Psa 79:4}  We have become a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those around us.
{Psa 79:4}  我们成为邻国的羞辱，成为我们四围人的嗤笑讥刺。
{Psa 79:5}  How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?
{Psa 79:5}  耶和华啊，这到几时呢？你要动怒到永远吗？你的愤恨要如火焚烧吗？
{Psa 79:6}  Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name!
{Psa 79:6}  愿你将你的忿怒倒在那不认识你的外邦和那不求告你名的国度。
{Psa 79:7}  For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation.
{Psa 79:7}  因为他们吞了雅各，把他的住处变为荒场。
{Psa 79:8}  Do not remember against us our former iniquities; let your compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low.
{Psa 79:8}  求你不要记念我们先祖的罪孽，向我们追讨；愿你的慈悲快迎着我们，因为我们落到极卑微的地步。
{Psa 79:9}  Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us, and atone for our sins, for your name's sake!
{Psa 79:9}  拯救我们的神啊，求你因你名的荣耀帮助我们！为你名的缘故搭救我们，赦免我们的罪。
{Psa 79:10} Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes!
{Psa 79:10} 为何容外邦人说“他们的神在那里”呢？愿你使外邦人知道你在我们眼前伸你仆人流血的冤。
{Psa 79:11} Let the groans of the prisoners come before you; according to your great power, preserve those doomed to die!
{Psa 79:11} 愿被囚之人的叹息达到你面前；愿你按你的大能力存留那些将要死的人。
{Psa 79:12} Return sevenfold into the lap of our neighbors the taunts with which they have taunted you, O Lord!
{Psa 79:12} 主啊，愿你将我们邻邦所羞辱你的羞辱加七倍归到他们身上。
{Psa 79:13} But we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.
{Psa 79:13} 这样，你的民，你草场的羊，要称谢你，直到永远；要述说赞美你的话，直到万代。
{Psa 80:1}  To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. A Testimony. Of Asaph, a Psalm. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth.
{Psa 80:1}  （亚萨的诗，交与伶长。调用为证的百合花。）领约瑟如领羊群之以色列的牧者啊，求你留心听！坐在二基路伯上的啊，求你发出光来！
{Psa 80:2}  Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might and come to save us!
{Psa 80:2}  在以法莲、便雅悯、玛拿西前面施展你的大能，来救我们。
{Psa 80:3}  Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved!
{Psa 80:3}  神啊，求你使我们回转（或作：复兴），使你的脸发光，我们便要得救！
{Psa 80:4}  O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?
{Psa 80:4}  耶和华万军之神啊，你向你百姓的祷告发怒，要到几时呢？
{Psa 80:5}  You have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in full measure.
{Psa 80:5}  你以眼泪当食物给他们吃，又多量出眼泪给他们喝。
{Psa 80:6}  You make us an object of contention for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.
{Psa 80:6}  你使邻邦因我们分争；我们的仇敌彼此戏笑。
{Psa 80:7}  Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved!
{Psa 80:7}  万军之神啊，求你使我们回转，使你的脸发光，我们便要得救！
{Psa 80:8}  You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
{Psa 80:8}  你从埃及挪出一棵葡萄树，赶出外邦人，把这树栽上。
{Psa 80:9}  You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land.
{Psa 80:9}  你在这树根前预备了地方，他就深深扎根，爬满了地。
{Psa 80:10} The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.
{Psa 80:10} 他的影子遮满了山，枝子好像佳美的香柏树。
{Psa 80:11} It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the River.
{Psa 80:11} 他发出枝子，长到大海，发出蔓子，延到大河。
{Psa 80:12} Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?
{Psa 80:12} 你为何拆毁这树的篱笆，任凭一切过路的人摘取？
{Psa 80:13} The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it.
{Psa 80:13} 林中出来的野猪把他糟踏；野地的走兽拿他当食物。
{Psa 80:14} Turn again, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine,
{Psa 80:14} 万军之神啊，求你回转！从天上垂看，眷顾这葡萄树，
{Psa 80:15} the stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself.
{Psa 80:15} 保护你右手所栽的和你为自己所坚固的枝子。
{Psa 80:16} They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your face!
{Psa 80:16} 这树已经被火焚烧，被刀砍伐；他们因你脸上的怒容就灭亡了。
{Psa 80:17} But let your hand be on the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!
{Psa 80:17} 愿你的手扶持你右边的人，就是你为自己所坚固的人子。
{Psa 80:18} Then we shall not turn back from you; give us life, and we will call upon your name!
{Psa 80:18} 这样，我们便不退后离开你；求你救活我们，我们就要求告你的名。
{Psa 80:19} Restore us, O LORD God of hosts! Let your face shine, that we may be saved!
{Psa 80:19} 耶和华万军之神啊，求你使我们回转，使你的脸发光，我们便要得救！
{Psa 81:1}  To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith. Of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob!
{Psa 81:1}  （亚萨的诗，交与伶长。用迦特乐器。）你们当向神我们的力量大声欢呼，向雅各的神发声欢乐！
{Psa 81:2}  Raise a song; sound the tambourine, the sweet lyre with the harp.
{Psa 81:2}  唱起诗歌，打手鼓，弹美琴与瑟。
{Psa 81:3}  Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.
{Psa 81:3}  当在月朔并月望我们过节的日期吹角，
{Psa 81:4}  For it is a statute for Israel, a rule of the God of Jacob.
{Psa 81:4}  因这是为以色列定的律例，是雅各神的典章。
{Psa 81:5}  He made it a decree in Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a language I had not known:
{Psa 81:5}  他去攻击埃及地的时候，在约瑟中间立此为证。我在那里听见我所不明白的言语：
{Psa 81:6}  "I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket.
{Psa 81:6}  神说：我使你的肩得脱重担，你的手放下筐子。
{Psa 81:7}  In distress you called, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
{Psa 81:7}  你在急难中呼求，我就搭救你；我在雷的隐密处应允你，在米利巴水那里试验你。（细拉）
{Psa 81:8}  Hear, O my people, while I admonish you! O Israel, if you would but listen to me!
{Psa 81:8}  我的民哪，你当听，我要劝戒你；以色列啊，甚愿你肯听从我。
{Psa 81:9}  There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god.
{Psa 81:9}  在你当中，不可有别的神；外邦的神，你也不可下拜。
{Psa 81:10} I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
{Psa 81:10} 我是耶和华你的神，曾把你从埃及地领上来；你要大大张口，我就给你充满。
{Psa 81:11} "But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would not submit to me.
{Psa 81:11} 无奈，我的民不听我的声音；以色列全不理我。
{Psa 81:12} So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels.
{Psa 81:12} 我便任凭他们心里刚硬，随自己的计谋而行。
{Psa 81:13} Oh, that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!
{Psa 81:13} 甚愿我的民肯听从我，以色列肯行我的道，
{Psa 81:14} I would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes.
{Psa 81:14} 我便速速治服他们的仇敌，反手攻击他们的敌人。
{Psa 81:15} Those who hate the LORD would cringe toward him, and their fate would last forever.
{Psa 81:15} 恨耶和华的人必来投降，但他的百姓必永久长存。
{Psa 81:16} But he would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."
{Psa 81:16} 他也必拿上好的麦子给他们吃，又拿从磐石出的蜂蜜叫他们饱足。
{Psa 82:1}  A Psalm of Asaph. God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment:

{Psa 89:31} 背弃我的律例，不遵守我的诫命，
{Psa 89:32} then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes,
{Psa 89:32} 我就要用杖责罚他们的过犯，用鞭责罚他们的罪孽。
{Psa 89:33} but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness.
{Psa 89:33} 只是我必不将我的慈爱全然收回，也必不叫我的信实废弃。
{Psa 89:34} I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips.
{Psa 89:34} 我必不背弃我的约，也不改变我口中所出的。
{Psa 89:35} Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.
{Psa 89:35} 我一次指着自己的圣洁起誓：我决不向大卫说谎！
{Psa 89:36} His offspring shall endure forever, his throne as long as the sun before me.
{Psa 89:36} 他的后裔要存到永远；他的宝座在我面前如日之恒一般，
{Psa 89:37} Like the moon it shall be established forever, a faithful witness in the skies." Selah.
{Psa 89:37} 又如月亮永远坚立，如天上确实的见证。（细拉）
{Psa 89:38} But now you have cast off and rejected; you are full of wrath against your anointed.
{Psa 89:38} 但你恼怒你的受膏者，就丢掉弃绝他。
{Psa 89:39} You have renounced the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dust.
{Psa 89:39} 你厌恶了与仆人所立的约，将他的冠冕践踏于地。
{Psa 89:40} You have breached all his walls; you have laid his strongholds in ruins.
{Psa 89:40} 你拆毁了他一切的篱笆，使他的保障变为荒场。
{Psa 89:41} All who pass by plunder him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
{Psa 89:41} 凡过路的人都抢夺他；他成为邻邦的羞辱。
{Psa 89:42} You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.
{Psa 89:42} 你高举了他敌人的右手；你叫他一切的仇敌欢喜。
{Psa 89:43} You have also turned back the edge of his sword, and you have not made him stand in battle.
{Psa 89:43} 你叫他的刀剑卷刃，叫他在争战之中站立不住。
{Psa 89:44} You have made his splendor to cease and cast his throne to the ground.
{Psa 89:44} 你使他的光辉止息，将他的宝座推倒于地。
{Psa 89:45} You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah.
{Psa 89:45} 你减少他青年的日子，又使他蒙羞。（细拉）
{Psa 89:46} How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?
{Psa 89:46} 耶和华啊，这要到几时呢？你要将自己隐藏到永远吗？你的忿怒如火焚烧要到几时呢？
{Psa 89:47} Remember how short my time is! For what vanity you have created all the children of man!
{Psa 89:47} 求你想念我的时候是何等的短少；你创造世人，要使他们归何等的虚空呢？
{Psa 89:48} What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.
{Psa 89:48} 谁能常活免死、救他的灵魂脱离阴间的权柄呢？（细拉）
{Psa 89:49} Lord, where is your steadfast love of old, which by your faithfulness you swore to David?
{Psa 89:49} 主啊，你从前凭你的信实向大卫立誓要施行的慈爱在那里呢？
{Psa 89:50} Remember, O Lord, how your servants are mocked, and how I bear in my heart the insults of all the many nations,
{Psa 89:50} 主啊，求你记念仆人们所受的羞辱，记念我怎样将一切强盛民的羞辱存在我怀里。
{Psa 89:51} with which your enemies mock, O LORD, with which they mock the footsteps of your anointed.
{Psa 89:51} 耶和华啊，你的仇敌用这羞辱羞辱了你的仆人，羞辱了你受膏者的脚踪。
{Psa 89:52} Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and Amen.
{Psa 89:52} 耶和华是应当称颂的，直到永远。阿们！阿们！

{Psa 90:5}  You sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning:
{Psa 90:5}  你叫他们如水冲去；他们如睡一觉。早晨，他们如生长的草，
{Psa 90:6}  in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers.
{Psa 90:6}  早晨发芽生长，晚上割下枯干。
{Psa 90:7}  For we are brought to an end by your anger; by your wrath we are dismayed.

{Psa 90:9}  For all our days pass away under your wrath; we bring our years to an end like a sigh.
{Psa 90:9}  我们经过的日子都在你震怒之下；我们度尽的年岁好像一声叹息。
{Psa 90:10} The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty; yet their span is but toil and trouble; they are soon gone, and we fly away.
{Psa 90:10} 我们一生的年日是七十岁，若是强壮可到八十岁；但其中所矜夸的不过是劳苦愁烦，转眼成空，我们便如飞而去。
{Psa 90:11} Who considers the power of your anger, and your wrath according to the fear of you?
{Psa 90:11} 谁晓得你怒气的权势？谁按着你该受的敬畏晓得你的忿怒呢？
{Psa 90:12} So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom.
{Psa 90:12} 求你指教我们怎样数算自己的日子，好叫我们得着智慧的心。
{Psa 90:13} Return, O LORD! How long? Have pity on your servants!
{Psa 90:13} 耶和华啊，我们要等到几时呢？求你转回，为你的仆人后悔。

{Psa 90:16} 愿你的作为向你仆人显现；愿你的荣耀向他们子孙显明。
{Psa 90:17} Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish the work of our hands!
{Psa 90:17} 愿主我们神的荣美归于我们身上。愿你坚立我们手所做的工；我们手所做的工，愿你坚立。

{Psa 91:2}  I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."
{Psa 91:2}  我要论到耶和华说：他是我的避难所，是我的山寨，是我的神，是我所倚靠的。
{Psa 91:3}  For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence.
{Psa 91:3}  他必救你脱离捕鸟人的网罗和毒害的瘟疫。
{Psa 91:4}  He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.
{Psa 91:4}  他必用自己的翎毛遮蔽你；你要投靠在他的翅膀底下；他的诚实是大小的盾牌。
{Psa 91:5}  You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,

{Psa 92:1}  A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath. It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to your name, O Most High;
{Psa 92:1}  （安息日的诗歌。）称谢耶和华！歌颂你至高者的名！
{Psa 92:2}  to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night,
{Psa 92:2}  用十弦的乐器和瑟，用琴弹幽雅的声音，早晨传扬你的慈爱；每夜传扬你的信实。这本为美事。
{Psa 92:3}  to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre.
{Psa 92:3}  (SEE 92:2)
{Psa 92:4}  For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy.
{Psa 92:4}  因你耶和华藉着你的作为叫我高兴，我要因你手的工作欢呼。
{Psa 92:5}  How great are your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep!
{Psa 92:5}  耶和华啊，你的工作何其大！你的心思极其深！
{Psa 92:6}  The stupid man cannot know; the fool cannot understand this:
{Psa 92:6}  畜类人不晓得；愚顽人也不明白。
{Psa 92:7}  that though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever;
{Psa 92:7}  恶人茂盛如草，一切作孽之人发旺的时候，正是他们要灭亡，直到永远。
{Psa 92:8}  but you, O LORD, are on high forever.
{Psa 92:8}  惟你耶和华是至高，直到永远。
{Psa 92:9}  For behold, your enemies, O LORD, for behold, your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered.
{Psa 92:9}  耶和华啊，你的仇敌都要灭亡；一切作孽的也要离散。
{Psa 92:10} But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil.
{Psa 92:10} 你却高举了我的角，如野牛的角；我是被新油膏了的。
{Psa 92:11} My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.
{Psa 92:11} 我眼睛看见仇敌遭报；我耳朵听见那些起来攻击我的恶人受罚。
{Psa 92:12} The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

{Psa 92:13} They are planted in the house of the LORD; they flourish in the courts of our God.
{Psa 92:13} 他们栽于耶和华的殿中，发旺在我们神的院里。
{Psa 92:14} They still bear fruit in old age; they are ever full of sap and green,
{Psa 92:14} 他们年老的时候仍要结果子，要满了汁浆而常发青，
{Psa 92:15} to declare that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
{Psa 92:15} 好显明耶和华是正直的。他是我的磐石，在他毫无不义。
{Psa 93:1}  The LORD reigns; he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved.
{Psa 93:1}  耶和华作王！他以威严为衣穿上；耶和华以能力为衣，以能力束腰，世界就坚定，不得动摇。
{Psa 93:2}  Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting.
{Psa 93:2}  你的宝座从太初立定；你从亘古就有。
{Psa 93:3}  The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring.
{Psa 93:3}  耶和华啊，大水扬起，大水发声，波浪澎湃。
{Psa 93:4}  Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty!
{Psa 93:4}  耶和华在高处大有能力，胜过诸水的响声，洋海的大浪。
{Psa 93:5}  Your decrees are very trustworthy; holiness befits your house, O LORD, forevermore.
{Psa 93:5}  耶和华啊，你的法度最的确；你的殿永称为圣，是合宜的。
{Psa 94:1}  O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth!
{Psa 94:1}  耶和华啊，你是伸冤的神；伸冤的神啊，求你发出光来！
{Psa 94:2}  Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve!
{Psa 94:2}  审判世界的主啊，求你挺身而立，使骄傲人受应得的报应！
{Psa 94:3}  O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?
{Psa 94:3}  耶和华啊，恶人夸胜要到几时呢？要到几时呢？
{Psa 94:4}  They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.
{Psa 94:4}  他们絮絮叨叨说傲慢的话；一切作孽的人都自己夸张。
{Psa 94:5}  They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage.
{Psa 94:5}  耶和华啊，他们强压你的百姓，苦害你的产业。
{Psa 94:6}  They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless;
{Psa 94:6}  他们杀死寡妇和寄居的，又杀害孤儿。
{Psa 94:7}  and they say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive."
{Psa 94:7}  他们说：耶和华必不看见；雅各的神必不思念。
{Psa 94:8}  Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise?
{Psa 94:8}  你们民间的畜类人当思想；你们愚顽人到几时才有智慧呢？
{Psa 94:9}  He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?
{Psa 94:9}  造耳朵的，难道自己不听见吗？造眼睛的，难道自己不看见吗？
{Psa 94:10} He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge--
{Psa 94:10} 管教列邦的，就是叫人得知识的，难道自己不惩治人吗？
{Psa 94:11} the LORD--knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath.
{Psa 94:11} 耶和华知道人的意念是虚妄的。
{Psa 94:12} Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O LORD, and whom you teach out of your law,
{Psa 94:12} 耶和华啊，你所管教、用律法所教训的人是有福的！
{Psa 94:13} to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
{Psa 94:13} 你使他在遭难的日子得享平安；惟有恶人陷在所挖的坑中。
{Psa 94:14} For the LORD will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage;
{Psa 94:14} 因为耶和华必不丢弃他的百姓，也不离弃他的产业。
{Psa 94:15} for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
{Psa 94:15} 审判要转向公义；心里正直的，必都随从。
{Psa 94:16} Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers?
{Psa 94:16} 谁肯为我起来攻击作恶的？谁肯为我站起抵挡作孽的？
{Psa 94:17} If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.
{Psa 94:17} 若不是耶和华帮助我，我就住在寂静之中了。
{Psa 94:18} When I thought, "My foot slips," your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up.
{Psa 94:18} 我正说我失了脚，耶和华啊，那时你的慈爱扶助我。
{Psa 94:19} When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul.
{Psa 94:19} 我心里多忧多疑，你安慰我，就使我欢乐。
{Psa 94:20} Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who frame injustice by statute?
{Psa 94:20} 那藉着律例架弄残害、在位上行奸恶的，岂能与你相交吗？
{Psa 94:21} They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
{Psa 94:21} 他们大家聚集攻击义人，将无辜的人定为死罪。
{Psa 94:22} But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge.
{Psa 94:22} 但耶和华向来作了我的高台；我的神作了我投靠的磐石。
{Psa 94:23} He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out.
{Psa 94:23} 他叫他们的罪孽归到他们身上。他们正在行恶之中，他要剪除他们；耶和华我们的神要把他们剪除。
{Psa 95:1}  Oh come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!
{Psa 95:1}  来啊，我们要向耶和华歌唱，向拯救我们的磐石欢呼！
{Psa 95:2}  Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!
{Psa 95:2}  我们要来感谢他，用诗歌向他欢呼！
{Psa 95:3}  For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
{Psa 95:3}  因耶和华为大神，为大王，超乎万神之上。
{Psa 95:4}  In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also.
{Psa 95:4}  地的深处在他手中；山的高峰也属他。
{Psa 95:5}  The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.
{Psa 95:5}  海洋属他，是他造的；旱地也是他手造成的。
{Psa 95:6}  Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD, our Maker!
{Psa 95:6}  来啊，我们要屈身敬拜，在造我们的耶和华面前跪下。
{Psa 95:7}  For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, if you hear his voice,
{Psa 95:7}  因为他是我们的神；我们是他草场的羊，是他手下的民。惟愿你们今天听他的话：
{Psa 95:8}  do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,
{Psa 95:8}  你们不可硬着心，像当日在米利巴，就是在旷野的玛撒。
{Psa 95:9}  when your fathers put me to the test and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work.
{Psa 95:9}  那时，你们的祖宗试我探我，并且观看我的作为。
{Psa 95:10} For forty years I loathed that generation and said, "They are a people who go astray in their heart, and they have not known my ways."
{Psa 95:10} 四十年之久，我厌烦那世代，说：这是心里迷糊的百姓，竟不晓得我的作为！
{Psa 95:11} Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They shall not enter my rest."
{Psa 95:11} 所以，我在怒中起誓，说：他们断不可进入我的安息！
{Psa 96:1}  Oh sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth!
{Psa 96:1}  你们要向耶和华唱新歌！全地都要向耶和华歌唱！
{Psa 96:2}  Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day.
{Psa 96:2}  要向耶和华歌唱，称颂他的名！天天传扬他的救恩！
{Psa 96:3}  Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples!
{Psa 96:3}  在列邦中述说他的荣耀！在万民中述说他的奇事！
{Psa 96:4}  For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods.
{Psa 96:4}  因耶和华为大，当受极大的赞美；他在万神之上，当受敬畏。
{Psa 96:5}  For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the LORD made the heavens.
{Psa 96:5}  外邦的神都属虚无；惟独耶和华创造诸天。
{Psa 96:6}  Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
{Psa 96:6}  有尊荣和威严在他面前；有能力与华美在他圣所。
{Psa 96:7}  Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength!
{Psa 96:7}  民中的万族啊，你们要将荣耀、能力归给耶和华，都归给耶和华！
{Psa 96:8}  Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come into his courts!
{Psa 96:8}  要将耶和华的名所当得的荣耀归给他，拿供物来进入他的院宇。
{Psa 96:9}  Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness; tremble before him, all the earth!
{Psa 96:9}  当以圣洁的（的：或作为）妆饰敬拜耶和华；全地要在他面前战抖！
{Psa 96:10} Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns! Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity."
{Psa 96:10} 人在列邦中要说：耶和华作王！世界就坚定，不得动摇；他要按公正审判众民。
{Psa 96:11} Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
{Psa 96:11} 愿天欢喜，愿地快乐！愿海和其中所充满的澎湃！
{Psa 96:12} let the field exult, and everything in it! Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy
{Psa 96:12} 愿田和其中所有的都欢乐！那时，林中的树木都要在耶和华面前欢呼。
{Psa 96:13} before the LORD, for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in his faithfulness.
{Psa 96:13} 因为他来了，他来要审判全地。他要按公义审判世界，按他的信实审判万民。
{Psa 97:1}  The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad!
{Psa 97:1}  耶和华作王！愿地快乐！愿众海岛欢喜！
{Psa 97:2}  Clouds and thick darkness are all around him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
{Psa 97:2}  密云和幽暗在他的四围；公义和公平是他宝座的根基。
{Psa 97:3}  Fire goes before him and burns up his adversaries all around.
{Psa 97:3}  有烈火在他前头行，烧灭他四围的敌人。
{Psa 97:4}  His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees and trembles.
{Psa 97:4}  他的闪电光照世界，大地看见便震动。
{Psa 97:5}  The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.

{Psa 104:32}    who looks on the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke!
{Psa 104:32}    他看地，地便震动；他摸山，山就冒烟。
{Psa 104:33}    I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being.
{Psa 104:33}    我要一生向耶和华唱诗！我还活的时候，要向我神歌颂！
{Psa 104:34}    May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the LORD.
{Psa 104:34}    愿他以我的默念为甘甜！我要因耶和华欢喜！
{Psa 104:35}    Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and let the wicked be no more! Bless the LORD, O my soul! Praise the LORD!
{Psa 104:35}    愿罪人从世上消灭！愿恶人归于无有！我的心哪，要称颂耶和华！你们要赞美耶和华（原文作哈利路亚；下同）！
{Psa 105:1} Oh give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples!
{Psa 105:1} 你们要称谢耶和华，求告他的名，在万民中传扬他的作为！
{Psa 105:2} Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works!
{Psa 105:2} 要向他唱诗歌颂，谈论他一切奇妙的作为！
{Psa 105:3} Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!
{Psa 105:3} 要以他的圣名夸耀！寻求耶和华的人，心中应当欢喜！
{Psa 105:4} Seek the LORD and his strength; seek his presence continually!
{Psa 105:4} 要寻求耶和华与他的能力，时常寻求他的面。
{Psa 105:5} Remember the wondrous works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,
{Psa 105:5} 他仆人亚伯拉罕的后裔，他所拣选雅各的子孙哪，你们要记念他奇妙的作为和他的奇事，并他口中的判语。
{Psa 105:6} O offspring of Abraham, his servant, children of Jacob, his chosen ones!
{Psa 105:6} (SEE 105:5)
{Psa 105:7} He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
{Psa 105:7} 他是耶和华我们的神；全地都有他的判断。
{Psa 105:8} He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
{Psa 105:8} 他记念他的约，直到永远；他所吩咐的话，直到千代，
{Psa 105:9} the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,
{Psa 105:9} 就是与亚伯拉罕所立的约，向以撒所起的誓。
{Psa 105:10}    which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
{Psa 105:10}    他又将这约向雅各定为律例，向以色列定为永远的约，
{Psa 105:11}    saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance."
{Psa 105:11}    说：我必将迦南地赐给你，作你产业的分。
{Psa 105:12}    When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,
{Psa 105:12}    当时，他们人丁有限，数目稀少，并且在那地为寄居的。
{Psa 105:13}    wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,
{Psa 105:13}    他们从这邦游到那邦，从这国行到那国。
{Psa 105:14}    he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,
{Psa 105:14}    他不容什么人欺负他们，为他们的缘故责备君王，
{Psa 105:15}    saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!"
{Psa 105:15}    说：不可难为我受膏的人，也不可恶待我的先知。
{Psa 105:16}    When he summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread,
{Psa 105:16}    他命饥荒降在那地上，将所倚靠的粮食全行断绝，
{Psa 105:17}    he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
{Psa 105:17}    在他们以先打发一个人去，约瑟被卖为奴仆。
{Psa 105:18}    His feet were hurt with fetters; his neck was put in a collar of iron;
{Psa 105:18}    人用脚镣伤他的脚；他被铁链捆拘。
{Psa 105:19}    until what he had said came to pass, the word of the LORD tested him.
{Psa 105:19}    耶和华的话试炼他，直等到他所说的应验了。
{Psa 105:20}    The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free;
{Psa 105:20}    王打发人把他解开，就是治理众民的，把他释放，
{Psa 105:21}    he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions,
{Psa 105:21}    立他作王家之主，掌管他一切所有的，
{Psa 105:22}    to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom.
{Psa 105:22}    使他随意捆绑他的臣宰，将智慧教导他的长老。
{Psa 105:23}    Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
{Psa 105:23}    以色列也到了埃及；雅各在含地寄居。
{Psa 105:24}    And the LORD made his people very fruitful and made them stronger than their foes.
{Psa 105:24}    耶和华使他的百姓生养众多，使他们比敌人强盛，
{Psa 105:25}    He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.
{Psa 105:25}    使敌人的心转去恨他的百姓，并用诡计待他的仆人。
{Psa 105:26}    He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
{Psa 105:26}    他打发他的仆人摩西和他所拣选的亚伦，
{Psa 105:27}    They performed his signs among them and miracles in the land of Ham.
{Psa 105:27}    在敌人中间显他的神迹，在含地显他的奇事。
{Psa 105:28}    He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they did not rebel against his words.
{Psa 105:28}    他命黑暗，就有黑暗；没有违背他话的。
{Psa 105:29}    He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die.
{Psa 105:29}    他叫埃及的水变为血，叫他们的鱼死了。
{Psa 105:30}    Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.
{Psa 105:30}    在他们的地上以及王宫的内室，青蛙多多滋生。
{Psa 105:31}    He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
{Psa 105:31}    他说一声，苍蝇就成群而来，并有虱子进入他们四境。
{Psa 105:32}    He gave them hail for rain, and fiery lightning bolts through their land.
{Psa 105:32}    他给他们降下冰雹为雨，在他们的地上降下火焰。
{Psa 105:33}    He struck down their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.
{Psa 105:33}    他也击打他们的葡萄树和无花果树，毁坏他们境内的树木。
{Psa 105:34}    He spoke, and the locusts came, young locusts without number,
{Psa 105:34}    他说一声，就有蝗虫蚂蚱上来，不计其数，
{Psa 105:35}    which devoured all the vegetation in their land and ate up the fruit of their ground.
{Psa 105:35}    吃尽了他们地上各样的菜蔬和田地的出产。
{Psa 105:36}    He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength.
{Psa 105:36}    他又击杀他们国内一切的长子，就是他们强壮时头生的。
{Psa 105:37}    Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.
{Psa 105:37}    他领自己的百姓带银子金子出来；他支派中没有一个软弱的。
{Psa 105:38}    Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.
{Psa 105:38}    他们出来的时候，埃及人便欢喜；原来埃及人惧怕他们。
{Psa 105:39}    He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.
{Psa 105:39}    他铺张云彩当遮盖，夜间使火光照。
{Psa 105:40}    They asked, and he brought quail, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.
{Psa 105:40}    他们一求，他就使鹌鹑飞来，并用天上的粮食叫他们饱足。
{Psa 105:41}    He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river.
{Psa 105:41}    他打开磐石，水就涌出；在干旱之处，水流成河。
{Psa 105:42}    For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham, his servant.
{Psa 105:42}    这都因他记念他的圣言和他的仆人亚伯拉罕。
{Psa 105:43}    So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing.
{Psa 105:43}    他带领百姓欢乐而出，带领选民欢呼前往。
{Psa 105:44}    And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples' toil,
{Psa 105:44}    他将列国的地赐给他们，他们便承受众民劳碌得来的，
{Psa 105:45}    that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Praise the LORD!
{Psa 105:45}    好使他们遵他的律例，守他的律法。你们要赞美耶和华！
{Psa 106:1} Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!
{Psa 106:1} 你们要赞美耶和华！要称谢耶和华，因他本为善；他的慈爱永远长存！
{Psa 106:2} Who can utter the mighty deeds of the LORD, or declare all his praise?
{Psa 106:2} 谁能传说耶和华的大能？谁能表明他一切的美德？
{Psa 106:3} Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times!
{Psa 106:3} 凡遵守公平，常行公义的，这人便为有福！
{Psa 106:4} Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people; help me when you save them,
{Psa 106:4} 耶和华啊，你用恩惠待你的百姓；求你也用这恩惠记念我，开你的救恩眷顾我，
{Psa 106:5} that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.
{Psa 106:5} 使我见你选民的福，乐你国民的乐，与你的产业一同夸耀。
{Psa 106:6} Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness.
{Psa 106:6} 我们与我们的祖宗一同犯罪；我们作了孽，行了恶。
{Psa 106:7} Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.
{Psa 106:7} 我们的祖宗在埃及不明白你的奇事，不记念你丰盛的慈爱，反倒在红海行了悖逆。
{Psa 106:8} Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power.
{Psa 106:8} 然而，他因自己的名拯救他们，为要彰显他的大能，
{Psa 106:9} He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry, and he led them through the deep as through a desert.
{Psa 106:9} 并且斥责红海，海便干了；他带领他们经过深处，如同经过旷野。
{Psa 106:10}    So he saved them from the hand of the foe and redeemed them from the power of the enemy.
{Psa 106:10}    他拯救他们脱离恨他们人的手，从仇敌手中救赎他们。
{Psa 106:11}    And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.
{Psa 106:11}    水淹没他们的敌人，没有一个存留。
{Psa 106:12}    Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
{Psa 106:12}    那时，他们才信了他的话，歌唱赞美他。
{Psa 106:13}    But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.
{Psa 106:13}    等不多时，他们就忘了他的作为，不仰望他的指教，
{Psa 106:14}    But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;
{Psa 106:14}    反倒在旷野大起欲心，在荒地试探神。
{Psa 106:15}    he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.
{Psa 106:15}    他将他们所求的赐给他们，却使他们的心灵软弱。
{Psa 106:16}    When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,
{Psa 106:16}    他们又在营中嫉妒摩西和耶和华的圣者亚伦。
{Psa 106:17}    the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
{Psa 106:17}    地裂开，吞下大坍，掩盖亚比兰一党的人。
{Psa 106:18}    Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
{Psa 106:18}    有火在他们的党中发起；有火焰烧毁了恶人。
{Psa 106:19}    They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image.
{Psa 106:19}    他们在何烈山造了牛犊，叩拜铸成的像。
{Psa 106:20}    They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
{Psa 106:20}    如此将他们荣耀的主换为吃草之牛的像，
{Psa 106:21}    They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
{Psa 106:21}    忘了神他们的救主；他曾在埃及行大事，
{Psa 106:22}    wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
{Psa 106:22}    在含地行奇事，在红海行可畏的事。
{Psa 106:23}    Therefore he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.
{Psa 106:23}    所以，他说要灭绝他们；若非有他所拣选的摩西站在当中（原文作破口），使他的忿怒转消，恐怕他就灭绝他们。
{Psa 106:24}    Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.
{Psa 106:24}    他们又藐视那美地，不信他的话，
{Psa 106:25}    They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD.
{Psa 106:25}    在自己帐棚内发怨言，不听耶和华的声音。
{Psa 106:26}    Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,
{Psa 106:26}    所以，他对他们起誓：必叫他们倒在旷野，
{Psa 106:27}    and would make their offspring fall among the nations, scattering them among the lands.
{Psa 106:27}    叫他们的后裔倒在列国之中，分散在各地。
{Psa 106:28}    Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;
{Psa 106:28}    他们又与巴力毗珥连合，且吃了祭死神（或作：人）的物。
{Psa 106:29}    they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
{Psa 106:29}    他们这样行，惹耶和华发怒，便有瘟疫流行在他们中间。
{Psa 106:30}    Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stayed.
{Psa 106:30}    那时，非尼哈站起，刑罚恶人，瘟疫这才止息。
{Psa 106:31}    And that was counted to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever.
{Psa 106:31}    那就算为他的义，世世代代，直到永远。
{Psa 106:32}    They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account,
{Psa 106:32}    他们在米利巴水又叫耶和华发怒，甚至摩西也受了亏损，
{Psa 106:33}    for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke rashly with his lips.
{Psa 106:33}    是因他们惹动他的灵，摩西（原文作他）用嘴说了急躁的话。
{Psa 106:34}    They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them,
{Psa 106:34}    他们不照耶和华所吩咐的灭绝外邦人，
{Psa 106:35}    but they mixed with the nations and learned to do as they did.
{Psa 106:35}    反与他们混杂相合，学习他们的行为，
{Psa 106:36}    They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
{Psa 106:36}    事奉他们的偶像，这就成了自己的网罗，
{Psa 106:37}    They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;
{Psa 106:37}    把自己的儿女祭祀鬼魔，
{Psa 106:38}    they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.
{Psa 106:38}    流无辜人的血，就是自己儿女的血，把他们祭祀迦南的偶像，那地就被血污秽了。
{Psa 106:39}    Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the whore in their deeds.
{Psa 106:39}    这样，他们被自己所做的污秽了，在行为上犯了邪淫。
{Psa 106:40}    Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;
{Psa 106:40}    所以，耶和华的怒气向他的百姓发作，憎恶他的产业，
{Psa 106:41}    he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.
{Psa 106:41}    将他们交在外邦人的手里；恨他们的人就辖制他们。
{Psa 106:42}    Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.
{Psa 106:42}    他们的仇敌也欺压他们，他们就伏在敌人手下。
{Psa 106:43}    Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes and were brought low through their iniquity.
{Psa 106:43}    他屡次搭救他们，他们却设谋背逆，因自己的罪孽降为卑下。
{Psa 106:44}    Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry.
{Psa 106:44}    然而，他听见他们哀告的时候，就眷顾他们的急难，
{Psa 106:45}    For their sake he remembered his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
{Psa 106:45}    为他们记念他的约，照他丰盛的慈爱后悔。
{Psa 106:46}    He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive.
{Psa 106:46}    他也使他们在凡掳掠他们的人面前蒙怜恤。
{Psa 106:47}    Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.
{Psa 106:47}    耶和华我们的神啊，求你拯救我们，从外邦中招聚我们，我们好称赞你的圣名，以赞美你为夸胜。
{Psa 106:48}    Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD!
{Psa 106:48}    耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的，从亘古直到永远。愿众民都说：阿们！你们要赞美耶和华！
{Psa 107:1} Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!
{Psa 107:1} 你们要称谢耶和华，因他本为善；他的慈爱永远长存！
{Psa 107:2} Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from trouble
{Psa 107:2} 愿耶和华的赎民说这话，就是他从敌人手中所救赎的，
{Psa 107:3} and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
{Psa 107:3} 从各地，从东从西，从南从北，所招聚来的。
{Psa 107:4} Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in;
{Psa 107:4} 他们在旷野荒地漂流，寻不见可住的城邑，
{Psa 107:5} hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.
{Psa 107:5} 又饥又渴，心里发昏。
{Psa 107:6} Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
{Psa 107:6} 于是，他们在苦难中哀求耶和华；他从他们的祸患中搭救他们，
{Psa 107:7} He led them by a straight way till they reached a city to dwell in.
{Psa 107:7} 又领他们行走直路，使他们往可居住的城邑。
{Psa 107:8} Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
{Psa 107:8} 但愿人因耶和华的慈爱和他向人所行的奇事都称赞他；
{Psa 107:9} For he satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul he fills with good things.
{Psa 107:9} 因他使心里渴慕的人得以知足，使心里饥饿的人得饱美物。
{Psa 107:10}    Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and in irons,
{Psa 107:10}    那些坐在黑暗中、死荫里的人被困苦和铁链捆锁，
{Psa 107:11}    for they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High.
{Psa 107:11}    是因他们违背神的话语，藐视至高者的旨意。
{Psa 107:12}    So he bowed their hearts down with hard labor; they fell down, with none to help.
{Psa 107:12}    所以，他用劳苦治服他们的心；他们仆倒，无人扶助。
{Psa 107:13}    Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
{Psa 107:13}    于是，他们在苦难中哀求耶和华；他从他们的祸患中拯救他们。
{Psa 107:14}    He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and burst their bonds apart.
{Psa 107:14}    他从黑暗中和死荫里领他们出来，折断他们的绑索。
{Psa 107:15}    Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
{Psa 107:15}    但愿人因耶和华的慈爱和他向人所行的奇事都称赞他；
{Psa 107:16}    For he shatters the doors of bronze and cuts in two the bars of iron.
{Psa 107:16}    因为他打破了铜门，砍断了铁闩。
{Psa 107:17}    Some were fools through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities suffered affliction;
{Psa 107:17}    愚妄人因自己的过犯和自己的罪孽便受苦楚。
{Psa 107:18}    they loathed any kind of food, and they drew near to the gates of death.
{Psa 107:18}    他们心里厌恶各样的食物，就临近死门。
{Psa 107:19}    Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
{Psa 107:19}    于是，他们在苦难中哀求耶和华；他从他们的祸患中拯救他们。
{Psa 107:20}    He sent out his word and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction.
{Psa 107:20}    他发命医治他们，救他们脱离死亡。
{Psa 107:21}    Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
{Psa 107:21}    但愿人因耶和华的慈爱和他向人所行的奇事都称赞他。
{Psa 107:22}    And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!
{Psa 107:22}    愿他们以感谢为祭献给他，欢呼述说他的作为！
{Psa 107:23}    Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters;
{Psa 107:23}    在海上坐船，在大水中经理事务的，
{Psa 107:24}    they saw the deeds of the LORD, his wondrous works in the deep.
{Psa 107:24}    他们看见耶和华的作为，并他在深水中的奇事。
{Psa 107:25}    For he commanded and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea.
{Psa 107:25}    因他一吩咐，狂风就起来，海中的波浪也扬起。
{Psa 107:26}    They mounted up to heaven; they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their evil plight;
{Psa 107:26}    他们上到天空，下到海底；他们的心因患难便消化。
{Psa 107:27}    they reeled and staggered like drunken men and were at their wits' end.
{Psa 107:27}    他们摇摇幌幌，东倒西歪，好像醉酒的人；他们的智慧无法可施。
{Psa 107:28}    Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
{Psa 107:28}    于是，他们在苦难中哀求耶和华，他从他们的祸患中领出他们来。
{Psa 107:29}    He made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
{Psa 107:29}    他使狂风止息，波浪就平静。
{Psa 107:30}    Then they were glad that the waters were quiet, and he brought them to their desired haven.
{Psa 107:30}    风息浪静，他们便欢喜；他就引他们到所愿去的海口。
{Psa 107:31}    Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
{Psa 107:31}    但愿人因耶和华的慈爱和他向人所行的奇事都称赞他。
{Psa 107:32}    Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
{Psa 107:32}    愿他们在民的会中尊崇他，在长老的位上赞美他！
{Psa 107:33}    He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground,
{Psa 107:33}    他使江河变为旷野，叫水泉变为干渴之地，
{Psa 107:34}    a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the evil of its inhabitants.
{Psa 107:34}    使肥地变为硷地；这都因其间居民的罪恶。
{Psa 107:35}    He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water.
{Psa 107:35}    他使旷野变为水潭，叫旱地变为水泉。
{Psa 107:36}    And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city to live in;
{Psa 107:36}    他使饥饿的人住在那里，好建造可住的城邑，
{Psa 107:37}    they sow fields and plant vineyards and get a fruitful yield.
{Psa 107:37}    又种田地，栽葡萄园，得享所出的土产。
{Psa 107:38}    By his blessing they multiply greatly, and he does not let their livestock diminish.
{Psa 107:38}    他又赐福给他们，叫他们生养众多，也不叫他们的牲畜减少。
{Psa 107:39}    When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, evil, and sorrow,
{Psa 107:39}    他们又因暴虐、患难、愁苦，就减少且卑下。
{Psa 107:40}    he pours contempt on princes and makes them wander in trackless wastes;
{Psa 107:40}    他使君王蒙羞被辱，使他们在荒废无路之地漂流。
{Psa 107:41}    but he raises up the needy out of affliction and makes their families like flocks.
{Psa 107:41}    他却将穷乏人安置在高处，脱离苦难，使他的家属多如羊群。
{Psa 107:42}    The upright see it and are glad, and all wickedness shuts its mouth.
{Psa 107:42}    正直人看见就欢喜；罪孽之辈必塞口无言。
{Psa 107:43}    Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things; let them consider the steadfast love of the LORD.
{Psa 107:43}    凡有智慧的，必在这些事上留心，也必思想耶和华的慈爱。

{Psa 108:10}    谁能领我进坚固城？谁能引我到以东地？

{Psa 108:11}    神啊，你不是丢弃了我们吗？神啊，你不和我们的军兵同去吗？
{Psa 108:12}    Oh grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man!
{Psa 108:12}    求你帮助我们攻击敌人，因为人的帮助是枉然的。
{Psa 108:13}    With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
{Psa 108:13}    我们倚靠神才得施展大能，因为践踏我们敌人的就是他。

{Psa 109:15}    愿这些罪常在耶和华面前，使他的名号断绝于世！
{Psa 109:16}    For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted, to put them to death.
{Psa 109:16}    因为他不想施恩，却逼迫困苦穷乏的和伤心的人，要把他们治死。

{Psa 109:28}    任凭他们咒骂，惟愿你赐福；他们几时起来就必蒙羞，你的仆人却要欢喜。
{Psa 109:29}    May my accusers be clothed with dishonor; may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a cloak!
{Psa 109:29}    愿我的对头披戴羞辱！愿他们以自己的羞愧为外袍遮身！
{Psa 109:30}    With my mouth I will give great thanks to the LORD; I will praise him in the midst of the throng.
{Psa 109:30}    我要用口极力称谢耶和华；我要在众人中间赞美他；

{Psa 124:1} A Song of Ascents. Of David. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side-- let Israel now say--
{Psa 124:1} （大卫上行之诗。）以色列人要说：若不是耶和华帮助我们，
{Psa 124:2} if it had not been the LORD who was on our side when people rose up against us,
{Psa 124:2} 若不是耶和华帮助我们，当人起来攻击我们、
{Psa 124:3} then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us;
{Psa 124:3} 向我们发怒的时候，就把我们活活地吞了。
{Psa 124:4} then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us;
{Psa 124:4} 那时，波涛必漫过我们，河水必淹没我们，
{Psa 124:5} then over us would have gone the raging waters.
{Psa 124:5} 狂傲的水必淹没我们。
{Psa 124:6} Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth!
{Psa 124:6} 耶和华是应当称颂的！他没有把我们当野食交给他们吞吃（原文作牙齿）。
{Psa 124:7} We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped!
{Psa 124:7} 我们好像雀鸟，从捕鸟人的网罗里逃脱；网罗破裂，我们逃脱了。
{Psa 124:8} Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.

{Psa 125:1} A Song of Ascents. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever.
{Psa 125:1} （上行之诗。）倚靠耶和华的人好像锡安山，永不动摇。
{Psa 125:2} As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people, from this time forth and forevermore.
{Psa 125:2} 众山怎样围绕耶路撒冷，耶和华也照样围绕他的百姓，从今时直到永远。

{Psa 127:1} A Song of Ascents. Of Solomon. Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.
{Psa 127:1} （所罗门上行之诗。）若不是耶和华建造房屋，建造的人就枉然劳力；若不是耶和华看守城池，看守的人就枉然警醒。
{Psa 127:2} It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives to his beloved sleep.
{Psa 127:2} 你们清晨早起，夜晚安歇，吃劳碌得来的饭，本是枉然；惟有耶和华所亲爱的，必叫他安然睡觉。

{Psa 129:2} "Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me.
{Psa 129:2} 从我幼年以来，敌人屡次苦害我，却没有胜了我。
{Psa 129:3} The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows."
{Psa 129:3} 如同扶犁的在我背上扶犁而耕，耕的犁沟甚长。
{Psa 129:4} The LORD is righteous; he has cut the cords of the wicked.
{Psa 129:4} 耶和华是公义的；他砍断了恶人的绳索。
{Psa 129:5} May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned backward!
{Psa 129:5} 愿恨恶锡安的都蒙羞退后！
{Psa 129:6} Let them be like the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up,
{Psa 129:6} 愿他们像房顶上的草，未长成而枯干，
{Psa 129:7} with which the reaper does not fill his hand nor the binder of sheaves his arms,
{Psa 129:7} 收割的不够一把，捆禾的也不满怀。
{Psa 129:8} nor do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you! We bless you in the name of the LORD!"
{Psa 129:8} 过路的也不说：愿耶和华所赐的福归与你们！我们奉耶和华的名给你们祝福！
{Psa 130:1} A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD!
{Psa 130:1} （上行之诗。）耶和华啊，我从深处向你求告！
{Psa 130:2} O Lord, hear my voice! Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my pleas for mercy!
{Psa 130:2} 主啊，求你听我的声音！愿你侧耳听我恳求的声音！
{Psa 130:3} If you, O LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
{Psa 130:3} 主耶和华啊，你若究察罪孽，谁能站得住呢？
{Psa 130:4} But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared.
{Psa 130:4} 但在你有赦免之恩，要叫人敬畏你。
{Psa 130:5} I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his word I hope;
{Psa 130:5} 我等候耶和华，我的心等候；我也仰望他的话。
{Psa 130:6} my soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning.
{Psa 130:6} 我的心等候主，胜于守夜的，等候天亮，胜于守夜的，等候天亮。

{Psa 131:1} A Song of Ascents. Of David. O LORD, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.
{Psa 131:1} （大卫上行之诗。）耶和华啊，我的心不狂傲，我的眼不高大；重大和测不透的事，我也不敢行。
{Psa 131:2} But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me.
{Psa 131:2} 我的心平稳安静，好像断过奶的孩子在他母亲的怀中；我的心在我里面真像断过奶的孩子。

{Psa 132:1} A Song of Ascents. Remember, O LORD, in David's favor, all the hardships he endured,
{Psa 132:1} （上行之诗。）耶和华啊，求你记念大卫所受的一切苦难！
{Psa 132:2} how he swore to the LORD and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,
{Psa 132:2} 他怎样向耶和华起誓，向雅各的大能者许愿，
{Psa 132:3} "I will not enter my house or get into my bed,
{Psa 132:3} 说：我必不进我的帐幕，也不上我的床榻；
{Psa 132:4} I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,
{Psa 132:4} 我不容我的眼睛睡觉，也不容我的眼目打盹；
{Psa 132:5} until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob."
{Psa 132:5} 直等我为耶和华寻得所在，为雅各的大能者寻得居所。
{Psa 132:6} Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.
{Psa 132:6} 我们听说约柜在以法他，我们在基列耶琳就寻见了。
{Psa 132:7} "Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool!"
{Psa 132:7} 我们要进他的居所，在他脚凳前下拜。
{Psa 132:8} Arise, O LORD, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.
{Psa 132:8} 耶和华啊，求你兴起，和你有能力的约柜同入安息之所！
{Psa 132:9} Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your saints shout for joy.
{Psa 132:9} 愿你的祭司披上公义！愿你的圣民欢呼！
{Psa 132:10}    For the sake of your servant David, do not turn away the face of your anointed one.
{Psa 132:10}    求你因你仆人大卫的缘故，不要厌弃你的受膏者！
{Psa 132:11}    The LORD swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: "One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne.
{Psa 132:11}    耶和华向大卫、凭诚实起了誓，必不反覆，说：我要使你所生的坐在你的宝座上。
{Psa 132:12}    If your sons keep my covenant and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their sons also forever shall sit on your throne."
{Psa 132:12}    你的众子若守我的约和我所教训他们的法度，他们的子孙必永远坐在你的宝座上。
{Psa 132:13}    For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his dwelling place:
{Psa 132:13}    因为耶和华拣选了锡安，愿意当作自己的居所，
{Psa 132:14}    "This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
{Psa 132:14}    说：这是我永远安息之所；我要住在这里，因为是我所愿意的。
{Psa 132:15}    I will abundantly bless her provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.
{Psa 132:15}    我要使其中的粮食丰满，使其中的穷人饱足。
{Psa 132:16}    Her priests I will clothe with salvation, and her saints will shout for joy.
{Psa 132:16}    我要使祭司披上救恩，圣民大声欢呼！
{Psa 132:17}    There I will make a horn to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.
{Psa 132:17}    我要叫大卫的角在那里发生；我为我的受膏者预备明灯。
{Psa 132:18}    His enemies I will clothe with shame, but on him his crown will shine."
{Psa 132:18}    我要使他的仇敌披上羞耻；但他的冠冕要在头上发光。
{Psa 133:1} A Song of Ascents. Of David. Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!
{Psa 133:1} （大卫上行之诗。）看哪，弟兄和睦同居是何等的善，何等的美！
{Psa 133:2} It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes!
{Psa 133:2} 这好比那贵重的油浇在亚伦的头上，流到胡须，又流到他的衣襟；
{Psa 133:3} It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion! For there the LORD has commanded the blessing, life forevermore.
{Psa 133:3} 又好比黑门的甘露降在锡安山；因为在那里有耶和华所命定的福，就是永远的生命。

{Psa 135:1} Praise the LORD! Praise the name of the LORD, give praise, O servants of the LORD,
{Psa 135:1} 你们要赞美耶和华！你们要赞美耶和华的名！耶和华的仆人站在耶和华殿中；站在我们神殿院中的，你们要赞美他！
{Psa 135:2} who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God!
{Psa 135:2} (SEE 135:1)
{Psa 135:3} Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing to his name, for it is pleasant!
{Psa 135:3} 你们要赞美耶和华！耶和华本为善；要歌颂他的名，因为这是美好的。
{Psa 135:4} For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel as his own possession.

{Psa 135:5} For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
{Psa 135:5} 原来我知道耶和华为大，也知道我们的主超乎万神之上。
{Psa 135:6} Whatever the LORD pleases, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.
{Psa 135:6} 耶和华在天上，在地下，在海中，在一切的深处，都随自己的意旨而行。
{Psa 135:7} He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth, who makes lightnings for the rain and brings forth the wind from his storehouses.
{Psa 135:7} 他使云雾从地极上腾，造电随雨而闪，从府库中带出风来。
{Psa 135:8} He it was who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and of beast;
{Psa 135:8} 他将埃及头生的，连人带牲畜都击杀了。
{Psa 135:9} who in your midst, O Egypt, sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants;
{Psa 135:9} 埃及啊，他施行神迹奇事，在你当中，在法老和他一切臣仆身上。
{Psa 135:10}    who struck down many nations and killed mighty kings,
{Psa 135:10}    他击杀许多的民，又杀戮大能的王，
{Psa 135:11}    Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan,
{Psa 135:11}    就是亚摩利王西宏和巴珊王噩，并迦南一切的国王，
{Psa 135:12}    and gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to his people Israel.
{Psa 135:12}    将他们的地赏赐他的百姓以色列为业。
{Psa 135:13}    Your name, O LORD, endures forever, your renown, O LORD, throughout all ages.
{Psa 135:13}    耶和华啊，你的名存到永远！耶和华啊，你可记念的名存到万代！
{Psa 135:14}    For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.
{Psa 135:14}    耶和华要为他的百姓伸冤，为他的仆人后悔。
{Psa 135:15}    The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands.
{Psa 135:15}    外邦的偶像是金的，银的，是人手所造的；
{Psa 135:16}    They have mouths, but do not speak; they have eyes, but do not see;
{Psa 135:16}    有口却不能言，有眼却不能看，
{Psa 135:17}    they have ears, but do not hear, nor is there any breath in their mouths.
{Psa 135:17}    有耳却不能听，口中也没有气息。
{Psa 135:18}    Those who make them become like them, so do all who trust in them.
