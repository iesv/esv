{Mar 1:1}   The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
{Mar 1:1}   神的儿子，耶稣基督福音的起头。
{Mar 1:2}   As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger /mesendZcr/ before your face, who will prepare your way,
{Mar 1:2}   正如先知以赛亚（有古卷没有以赛亚三个字）书上记着说：看哪，我要差遣我的使者在你前面，预备道路。
{Mar 1:3}   the voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,'"
{Mar 1:3}   在旷野有人声喊着说：预备主的道，修直他的路。
{Mar 1:4}   John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
{Mar 1:4}   照这话，约翰来了，在旷野施洗，传悔改的洗礼，使罪得赦。
{Mar 1:5}   And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
{Mar 1:5}   犹太全地和耶路撒冷的人都出去到约翰那里，承认他们的罪，在约但河里受他的洗。
{Mar 1:6}   Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild /wIld/ honey.
{Mar 1:6}   约翰穿骆驼毛的衣服，腰束皮带，吃的是蝗虫、野蜜。
{Mar 1:7}   And he preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap /strxp/[带子] of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop /stwp/[弯腰] down and untie. /Cn'tI/[解开]
{Mar 1:7}   他传道说：“有一位在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是弯腰给他解鞋带也是不配的。
{Mar 1:8}   I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
{Mar 1:8}   我是用水给你们施洗，他却要用圣灵给你们施洗。”
{Mar 1:9}   In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
{Mar 1:9}   那时，耶稣从加利利的拿撒勒来，在约但河里受了约翰的洗。
{Mar 1:10}  And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
{Mar 1:10}  他从水里一上来，就看见天裂开了，圣灵彷佛鸽子，降在他身上。
{Mar 1:11}  And a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved [心爱的] Son; with you I am well pleased."
{Mar 1:11}  又有声音从天上来，说：“你是我的爱子，我喜悦你。”
{Mar 1:12}  The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.
{Mar 1:12}  圣灵就把耶稣催到旷野里去。
{Mar 1:13}  And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering /ministcr/[服侍] to him.
{Mar 1:13}  他在旷野四十天，受撒但的试探，并与野兽同在一处，且有天使来伺候他。
{Mar 1:14}  Now after John was arrested, /ar'rest/[逮捕] Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God,
{Mar 1:14}  约翰下监以后，耶稣来到加利利，宣传神的福音，
{Mar 1:15}  and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
{Mar 1:15}  说：“日期满了，神的国近了。你们当悔改，信福音！”
{Mar 1:16}  Passing alongside [沿边] the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. [渔夫]
{Mar 1:16}  耶稣顺着加利利的海边走，看见西门和西门的兄弟安得烈在海边撒网；他们本是打鱼的。
{Mar 1:17}  And Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you become fishers [捕鱼者] of men."
{Mar 1:17}  耶稣对他们说：“来跟从我，我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。”
{Mar 1:18}  And immediately they left their nets and followed him.
{Mar 1:18}  他们就立刻舍了网，跟从了他。
{Mar 1:19}  And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee /zebEdE/ and John his brother, who were in their boat mending [修补] the nets.
{Mar 1:19}  耶稣稍往前走，又见西庇太的儿子雅各和雅各的兄弟约翰在船上补网。
{Mar 1:20}  And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired /hIr/[雇佣] servants and followed him.
{Mar 1:20}  耶稣随即招呼他们，他们就把父亲西庇太和雇工人留在船上，跟从耶稣去了。
{Mar 1:21}  And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching.
{Mar 1:21}  到了迦百农，耶稣就在安息日进了会堂教训人。
{Mar 1:22}  And they were astonished /as'toniS/[惊奇] at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
{Mar 1:22}  众人很希奇他的教训；因为他教训他们，正像有权柄的人，不像文士。
{Mar 1:23}  And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,
{Mar 1:23}  在会堂里，有一个人被污鬼附着。他喊叫说：
{Mar 1:24}  "What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God."
{Mar 1:24}  “拿撒勒人耶稣，我们与你有什么相干？你来灭我们吗？我知道你是谁，乃是神的圣者。”
{Mar 1:25}  But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"
{Mar 1:25}  耶稣责备他说：“不要作声！从这人身上出来吧。”
{Mar 1:26}  And the unclean spirit, convulsing /kCn'vcls/[抽筋] him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him.
{Mar 1:26}  污鬼叫那人抽了一阵疯，大声喊叫，就出来了。
{Mar 1:27}  And they were all amazed, [吃惊] so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey /o'bA/[服从] him."
{Mar 1:27}  众人都惊讶，以致彼此对问说：“这是什么事？是个新道理啊！他用权柄吩咐污鬼，连污鬼也听从了他。”
{Mar 1:28}  And at once his fame /fAm/ spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.
{Mar 1:28}  耶稣的名声就传遍了加利利的四方。
{Mar 1:29}  And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
{Mar 1:29}  他们一出会堂，就同着雅各、约翰，进了西门和安得烈的家。
{Mar 1:30}  Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill [prh.v卧病] with a fever, /fEvcr/ and immediately they told him about her.
{Mar 1:30}  西门的岳母正害热病躺着，就有人告诉耶稣。
{Mar 1:31}  And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.
{Mar 1:31}  耶稣进前拉着他的手，扶他起来，热就退了，他就服事他们。
{Mar 1:32}  That evening at sundown [日落] they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons.
{Mar 1:32}  天晚日落的时候，有人带着一切害病的，和被鬼附的，来到耶稣跟前。
{Mar 1:33}  And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
{Mar 1:33}  合城的人都聚集在门前。
{Mar 1:34}  And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit /pcr'mit/[许可] the demons to speak, because they knew him.
{Mar 1:34}  耶稣治好了许多害各样病的人，又赶出许多鬼，不许鬼说话，因为鬼认识他。
{Mar 1:35}  And rising /rIs/ very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate /desOlAt/[荒凉] place, and there he prayed.
{Mar 1:35}  次日早晨，天未亮的时候，耶稣起来，到旷野地方去，在那里祷告。
{Mar 1:36}  And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,
{Mar 1:36}  西门和同伴追了他去，
{Mar 1:37}  and they found him and said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."
{Mar 1:37}  遇见了就对他说：“众人都找你。”
{Mar 1:38}  And he said to them, "Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out."
{Mar 1:38}  耶稣对他们说：“我们可以往别处去，到邻近的乡村，我也好在那里传道，因为我是为这事出来的。”
{Mar 1:39}  And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.
{Mar 1:39}  于是在加利利全地，进了会堂，传道，赶鬼。
{Mar 1:40}  And a leper came to him, imploring /im'plor/[哀求] him, and kneeling said to him, "If you will, you can make me clean."
{Mar 1:40}  有一个长大麻疯的来求耶稣，向他跪下，说：“你若肯，必能叫我洁净了。”
{Mar 1:41}  Moved with pity, [动了同情心] he stretched /stretS/ out his hand and touched him and said to him, "I will; be clean."
{Mar 1:41}  耶稣动了慈心，就伸手摸他，说：“我肯，你洁净了吧！”
{Mar 1:42}  And immediately the leprosy /leprOsy/ left him, and he was made clean.
{Mar 1:42}  大麻疯即时离开他，他就洁净了。
{Mar 1:43}  And Jesus sternly /stcrnly/[严严地] charged him and sent him away at once,
{Mar 1:43}  耶稣严严的嘱咐他，就打发他走，
{Mar 1:44}  and said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them."
{Mar 1:44}  对他说：“你要谨慎，什么话都不可告诉人，只要去把身体给祭司察看，又因为你洁净了，献上摩西所吩咐的礼物，对众人作证据。”
{Mar 1:45}  But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter. [phr.prep. 从四面八方]
{Mar 1:45}  那人出去，倒说许多的话，把这件事传扬开了，叫耶稣以后不得再明明的进城，只好在外边旷野地方。人从各处都就了他来。
{Mar 2:1}   And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home.
{Mar 2:1}   过了些日子，耶稣又进了迦百农。人听见他在房子里，
{Mar 2:2}   And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them.
{Mar 2:2}   就有许多人聚集，甚至连门前都没有空地；耶稣就对他们讲道。
{Mar 2:3}   And they came, bringing to him a paralytic /pxra'litik/[中风] carried by four men.
{Mar 2:3}   有人带着一个瘫子来见耶稣，是用四个人抬来的；
{Mar 2:4}   And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, /kraud/ they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
{Mar 2:4}   因为人多，不得近前，就把耶稣所在的房子，拆了房顶，既拆通了，就把瘫子连所躺卧的褥子都缒下来。
{Mar 2:5}   And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
{Mar 2:5}   耶稣见他们的信心，就对瘫子说：“小子，你的罪赦了。”
{Mar 2:6}   Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts,
{Mar 2:6}   有几个文士坐在那里，心里议论，说：
{Mar 2:7}   "Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
{Mar 2:7}   “这个人为什么这样说呢？他说僭妄的话了。除了神以外，谁能赦罪呢？”
{Mar 2:8}   And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you question these things in your hearts?
{Mar 2:8}   耶稣心中知道他们心里这样议论，就说：“你们心里为什么这样议论呢？
{Mar 2:9}   Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your bed and walk'?
{Mar 2:9}   或对瘫子说‘你的罪赦了’，或说‘起来！拿你的褥子行走’；那一样容易呢？
{Mar 2:10}  But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"—he said to the paralytic—
{Mar 2:10}  但要叫你们知道，人子在地上有赦罪的权柄。”就对瘫子说：
{Mar 2:11}  "I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home."
{Mar 2:11}  “我吩咐你，起来！拿你的褥子回家去吧。”
{Mar 2:12}  And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"
{Mar 2:12}  那人就起来，立刻拿着褥子，当众人面前出去了，以致众人都惊奇，归荣耀与神，说：“我们从来没有见过这样的事！”
{Mar 2:13}  He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them.
{Mar 2:13}  耶稣又出到海边去，众人都就了他来，他便教训他们。
{Mar 2:14}  And as he passed by, he saw Levi /lEvI/ the son of Alphaeus /xlfACs/ sitting at the tax booth, /bwth/[摊亭] and he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
{Mar 2:14}  耶稣经过的时候，看见亚勒腓的儿子利未坐在税关上，就对他说：“你跟从我来。”他就起来，跟从了耶稣。
{Mar 2:15}  And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
{Mar 2:15}  耶稣在利未家里坐席的时候，有好些税吏和罪人与耶稣并门徒一同坐席；因为这样的人多，他们也跟随耶稣。
{Mar 2:16}  And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
{Mar 2:16}  法利赛人中的文士（有古卷：文士和法利赛人）看见耶稣和罪人并税吏一同吃饭，就对他门徒说：“他和税吏并罪人一同吃喝吗？”
{Mar 2:17}  And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, /fi'ziSan/[医师] but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."
{Mar 2:17}  耶稣听见，就对他们说：“康健的人用不着医生，有病的人才用得着。我来本不是召义人，乃是召罪人。”
{Mar 2:18}  Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
{Mar 2:18}  当下，约翰的门徒和法利赛人禁食。他们来问耶稣说：“约翰的门徒和法利赛人的门徒禁食，你的门徒倒不禁食，这是为什么呢？”
{Mar 2:19}  And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom /brIdˏgrwm/ is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
{Mar 2:19}  耶稣对他们说：“新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候，陪伴之人岂能禁食呢？新郎还同在，他们不能禁食。
{Mar 2:20}  The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
{Mar 2:20}  但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那日他们就要禁食。
{Mar 2:21}  No one sews /sO/[缝补] a piece of unshrunk [不缩] cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch /pxtS/[补丁] tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.
{Mar 2:21}  没有人把新布缝在旧衣服上，恐怕所补上的新布带坏了旧衣服，破的就更大了。
{Mar 2:22}  And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst /bcrst/[破裂] the skins—and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins."
{Mar 2:22}  也没有人把新酒装在旧皮袋里，恐怕酒把皮袋裂开，酒和皮袋就都坏了；惟把新酒装在新皮袋里。”
{Mar 2:23}  One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, /grAnˏfEld/[谷田] and as they made their way, his disciples began to pluck /plck/[拔] heads of grain.
{Mar 2:23}  耶稣当安息日从麦地经过。他门徒行路的时候，掐了麦穗。
{Mar 2:24}  And the Pharisees were saying to him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
{Mar 2:24}  法利赛人对耶稣说：“看哪，他们在安息日为什么做不可做的事呢？”
{Mar 2:25}  And he said to them, "Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him:
{Mar 2:25}  耶稣对他们说：“经上记着大卫和跟从他的人缺乏饥饿之时所做的事，你们没有念过吗？
{Mar 2:26}  how he entered the house of God, in the time of Abiathar /a'biathar/ the high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?"
{Mar 2:26}  他当亚比亚他作大祭司的时候，怎么进了神的殿，吃了陈设饼，又给跟从他的人吃。这饼除了祭司以外，人都不可吃。”
{Mar 2:27}  And he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
{Mar 2:27}  又对他们说：“安息日是为人设立的，人不是为安息日设立的。
{Mar 2:28}  So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
{Mar 2:28}  所以，人子也是安息日的主。”
{Mar 3:1}   Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand.
{Mar 3:1}   耶稣又进了会堂，在那里有一个人枯干了一只手。
{Mar 3:2}   And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.
{Mar 3:2}   众人窥探耶稣，在安息日医治不医治，意思是要控告耶稣。
{Mar 3:3}   And he said to the man with the withered hand, "Come here."
{Mar 3:3}   耶稣对那枯干一只手的人说：“起来，站在当中。”
{Mar 3:4}   And he said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?" But they were silent.
{Mar 3:4}   又问众人说：“在安息日行善行恶，救命害命，那样是可以的呢？”他们都不作声。
{Mar 3:5}   And he looked around at them with anger, /xngcr/[怒气] grieved /grEv/[悲伤] at their hardness [刚硬] of heart, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
{Mar 3:5}   耶稣怒目周围看他们，忧愁他们的心刚硬，就对那人说：“伸出手来！”他把手一伸，手就复了原。
{Mar 3:6}   The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel /kaunsl/[商议] with the Herodians /he'rOdian/ against him, how to destroy him.
{Mar 3:6}   法利赛人出去，同希律一党的人商议怎样可以除灭耶稣。
{Mar 3:7}   Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea
{Mar 3:7}   耶稣和门徒退到海边去，有许多人从加利利跟随他。
{Mar 3:8}   and Jerusalem and Idumea /idwmEa/ and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him.
{Mar 3:8}   还有许多人听见他所做的大事，就从犹太、耶路撒冷、以土买、约但河外，并推罗、西顿的四方来到他那里。
{Mar 3:9}   And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him,
{Mar 3:9}   他因为人多，就吩咐门徒叫一只小船伺候着，免得众人拥挤他。
{Mar 3:10}  for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him.
{Mar 3:10}  他治好了许多人，所以凡有灾病的，都挤进来要摸他。
{Mar 3:11}  And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God."
{Mar 3:11}  污鬼无论何时看见他，就俯伏在他面前，喊着说：“你是神的儿子。”
{Mar 3:12}  And he strictly /strikt/[严密地] ordered them not to make him known.
{Mar 3:12}  耶稣再三的嘱咐他们，不要把他显露出来。
{Mar 3:13}  And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him.
{Mar 3:13}  耶稣上了山，随自己的意思叫人来；他们便来到他那里。
{Mar 3:14}  And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach
{Mar 3:14}  他就设立十二个人，要他们常和自己同在，也要差他们去传道，
{Mar 3:15}  and have authority to cast out demons.
{Mar 3:15}  并给他们权柄赶鬼。
{Mar 3:16}  He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);
{Mar 3:16}  这十二个人有西门（耶稣又给他起名叫彼得），
{Mar 3:17}  James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, /bOa'ncrdZEs/ that is, Sons of Thunder); /thcndcr/[雷]
{Mar 3:17}  还有西庇太的儿子雅各和雅各的兄弟约翰（又给这个两人起名叫半尼其，就是雷子的意思），
{Mar 3:18}  Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, /bar'tholOmU/ and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, /thxdACs/ and Simon the Zealot, /zelct/[狂热者]
{Mar 3:18}  又有安得烈、腓力、巴多罗买、马太、多马、亚勒腓的儿子雅各、和达太，并奋锐党的西门；
{Mar 3:19}  and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
{Mar 3:19}  还有卖耶稣的加略人犹大。
{Mar 3:20}  Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat.
{Mar 3:20}  耶稣进了一个屋子，众人又聚集，甚至他连饭也顾不得吃。
{Mar 3:21}  And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, "He is out of his mind."
{Mar 3:21}  耶稣的亲属听见，就出来要拉住他，因为他们说他癫狂了。
{Mar 3:22}  And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, "He is possessed /pC'zes/[占有] by Beelzebul," /bE'elzbul/ and "by the prince of demons he casts out the demons."
{Mar 3:22}  从耶路撒冷下来的文士说：“他是被别西卜附着”；又说：“他是靠着鬼王赶鬼。”
{Mar 3:23}  And he called them to him and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
{Mar 3:23}  耶稣叫他们来，用比喻对他们说：“撒但怎能赶出撒但呢？
{Mar 3:24}  If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
{Mar 3:24}  若一国自相分争，那国就站立不住；
{Mar 3:25}  And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
{Mar 3:25}  若一家自相分争，那家就站立不住。
{Mar 3:26}  And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.
{Mar 3:26}  若撒但自相攻打分争，他就站立不住，必要灭亡。
{Mar 3:27}  But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder /plCndcr/[抢夺] his goods, unless he first binds /bInd/ the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house.
{Mar 3:27}  没有人能进壮士家里，抢夺他的家具；必先捆住那壮士，才可以抢夺他的家。。
{Mar 3:28}  "Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies /blxsfemy/ they utter, [发出的话]
{Mar 3:28}  我实在告诉你们，世人一切的罪和一切亵渎的话都可得赦免；
{Mar 3:29}  but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty [有罪的] of an eternal sin"—
{Mar 3:29}  凡亵渎圣灵的，却永不得赦免，乃要担当永远的罪。”
{Mar 3:30}  for they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit."
{Mar 3:30}  这话是因为他们说：“他是被污鬼附着的。”
{Mar 3:31}  And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him.
{Mar 3:31}  当下，耶稣的母亲和弟兄来，站在外边，打发人去叫他。
{Mar 3:32}  And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, "Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you."
{Mar 3:32}  有许多人在耶稣周围坐着，他们就告诉他说：“看哪，你母亲和你弟兄在外边找你。”
{Mar 3:33}  And he answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
{Mar 3:33}  耶稣回答说：“谁是我的母亲？谁是我的弟兄？”
{Mar 3:34}  And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
{Mar 3:34}  就四面观看那周围坐着的人，说：“看哪，我的母亲，我的弟兄。
{Mar 3:35}  For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother."
{Mar 3:35}  凡遵行神旨意的人就是我的弟兄姐妹和母亲了。”
{Mar 4:1}   Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea, and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.
{Mar 4:1}   耶稣又在海边教训人。有许多人到他那里聚集，他只得上船坐下。船在海里，众人都靠近海，站在岸上。
{Mar 4:2}   And he was teaching them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them:
{Mar 4:2}   耶稣就用比喻教训他们许多道理。在教训之间，对他们说：
{Mar 4:3}   "Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.
{Mar 4:3}   “你们听啊！有一个撒种的出去撒种。
{Mar 4:4}   And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.
{Mar 4:4}   撒的时候，有落在路旁的，飞鸟来吃尽了；
{Mar 4:5}   Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, [土壤] and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth /depth/[深度] of soil.
{Mar 4:5}   有落在土浅石头地上的，土既不深，发苗最快，
{Mar 4:6}   And when the sun rose, it was scorched, /skortS/[烧焦] and since it had no root, it withered away.
{Mar 4:6}   日头出来一晒，因为没有根，就枯干了；
{Mar 4:7}   Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked /tSOk/[窒息] it, and it yielded /yEld/[出产量] no grain.
{Mar 4:7}   有落在荆棘里的，荆棘长起来，把他挤住了，就不结实；
{Mar 4:8}   And other seeds fell into good soil and produced /prC'dUs/ grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."
{Mar 4:8}   又有落在好土里的，就发生长大，结实有三十倍的，有六十倍的，有一百倍的”；
{Mar 4:9}   And he said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
{Mar 4:9}   又说：“有耳可听的，就应当听！”
{Mar 4:10}  And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
{Mar 4:10}  无人的时候，跟随耶稣的人和十二个门徒问他这比喻的意思。
{Mar 4:11}  And he said to them, "To you has been given the secret /sEkret/ of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables,
{Mar 4:11}  耶稣对他们说：“神国的奥秘只叫你们知道，若是对外人讲，凡事就用比喻，
{Mar 4:12}  so that "'they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they should turn and be forgiven.'"
{Mar 4:12}  叫他们看是看见，却不晓得；听是听见，却不明白；恐怕他们回转过来，就得赦免。”
{Mar 4:13}  And he said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?
{Mar 4:13}  又对他们说：“你们不明白这比喻吗？这样怎能明白一切的比喻呢？
{Mar 4:14}  The sower sows the word.
{Mar 4:14}  撒种之人所撒的就是道。
{Mar 4:15}  And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them.
{Mar 4:15}  那撒在路旁的，就是人听了道，撒但立刻来，把撒在他心里的道夺了去。
{Mar 4:16}  And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.
{Mar 4:16}  那撒在石头地上的，就是人听了道，立刻欢喜领受，
{Mar 4:17}  And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation /tribU'lASCn/[患难] or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.
{Mar 4:17}  但他心里没有根，不过是暂时的，及至为道遭了患难，或是受了逼迫，立刻就跌倒了。
{Mar 4:18}  And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word,
{Mar 4:18}  还有那撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，
{Mar 4:19}  but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness /dE'sEt/[欺骗] of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves /prwv/[证实出] unfruitful. [不结果的]
{Mar 4:19}  后来有世上的思虑、钱财的迷惑，和别样的私欲进来，把道挤住了，就不能结实。
{Mar 4:20}  But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."
{Mar 4:20}  那撒在好地上的，就是人听道，又领受，并且结实，有三十倍的，有六十倍的，有一百倍的。”
{Mar 4:21}  And he said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a stand?
{Mar 4:21}  耶稣又对他们说：“人拿灯来，岂是要放在斗底下，床底下，不放在灯台上吗？
{Mar 4:22}  For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; [明显 显明 < 用手打过的] nor is anything secret except to come to light.
{Mar 4:22}  因为掩藏的事，没有不显出来的；隐瞒的事，没有不露出来的。
{Mar 4:23}  If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
{Mar 4:23}  有耳可听的，就应当听！”
{Mar 4:24}  And he said to them, "Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure /meZcr/ you use, it will be measured to you, and still more [phr.adv. 更加] will be added to you.
{Mar 4:24}  又说：“你们所听的要留心。你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们，并且要多给你们。
{Mar 4:25}  For to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away."
{Mar 4:25}  因为有的，还要给他；没有的，连他所有的也要夺去。”
{Mar 4:26}  And he said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground.
{Mar 4:26}  又说：“神的国如同人把种撒在地上。
{Mar 4:27}  He sleeps and rises night and day, [phr.夜以继日] and the seed sprouts /spraut/[发芽] and grows; he knows not how.
{Mar 4:27}  黑夜睡觉，白日起来，这种就发芽渐长，那人却不晓得如何这样。
{Mar 4:28}  The earth produces by itself, first the blade, /blAd/[叶片 刀片] then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
{Mar 4:28}  地生五谷是出于自然的：先发苗，后长穗，再后穗上结成饱满的子粒；
{Mar 4:29}  But when the grain is ripe, /rIp/[成熟] at once he puts in the sickle, /sikl/[镰刀] because the harvest has come."
{Mar 4:29}  谷既熟了，就用镰刀去割，因为收成的时候到了。”
{Mar 4:30}  And he said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?
{Mar 4:30}  又说：“神的国，我们可用什么比较呢？可用什么比喻表明呢？
{Mar 4:31}  It is like a grain of mustard /mCstard/ seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth,
{Mar 4:31}  好像一粒芥菜种，种在地里的时候，虽比地上的百种都小，
{Mar 4:32}  yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade." /SAd/[荫地]
{Mar 4:32}  但种上以后，就长起来，比各样的菜都大，又长出大枝来，甚至天上的飞鸟可以宿在他的荫下。”
{Mar 4:33}  With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.
{Mar 4:33}  耶稣用许多这样的比喻，照他们所能听的，对他们讲道。
{Mar 4:34}  He did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained /eks'plAn/[解释] everything.
{Mar 4:34}  若不用比喻，就不对他们讲；没有人的时候，就把一切的道讲给门徒听。
{Mar 4:35}  On that day, when evening /EvniN/ had come, he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."
{Mar 4:35}  当那天晚上，耶稣对门徒说：“我们渡到那边去吧。”
{Mar 4:36}  And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him.
{Mar 4:36}  门徒离开众人，耶稣仍在船上，他们就把他一同带去；也有别的船和他同行。
{Mar 4:37}  And a great windstorm /windstorm/[暴风] arose, and the waves /wAv/[波浪] were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already filling.
{Mar 4:37}  忽然起了暴风，波浪打入船内，甚至船要满了水。
{Mar 4:38}  But he was in the stern, /stcrn/[尾部] asleep on the cushion. /kuSCn/[垫物] And they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?"
{Mar 4:38}  耶稣在船尾上，枕着枕头睡觉。门徒叫醒了他，说：“夫子！我们丧命，你不顾吗？”
{Mar 4:39}  And he awoke and rebuked the wind /wind/ and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, /sEs/[终止] and there was a great calm. /kam/[平静]
{Mar 4:39}  耶稣醒了，斥责风，向海说：“住了吧！静了吧！”风就止住，大大的平静了。
{Mar 4:40}  He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?"
{Mar 4:40}  耶稣对他们说：“为什么胆怯？你们还没有信心吗？”
{Mar 4:41}  And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
{Mar 4:41}  他们就大大的惧怕，彼此说：“这到底是谁，连风和海也听从他了。”
{Mar 5:1}   They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. /gerasEns/
{Mar 5:1}   他们来到海那边格拉森人的地方。
{Mar 5:2}   And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs /twm/ a man with an unclean spirit.
{Mar 5:2}   耶稣一下船，就有一个被污鬼附着的人从坟茔里出来迎着他。
{Mar 5:3}   He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain, /tSAn/[锁链]
{Mar 5:3}   那人常住在坟茔里，没有人能捆住他，就是用铁链也不能；
{Mar 5:4}   for he had often been bound with shackles /Sxkl/[脚镣 枷锁] and chains, but he wrenched /rentS/[猛扭] the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue /sCb'dU/[制伏] him.
{Mar 5:4}   因为人屡次用脚镣和铁链捆锁他，铁链竟被他挣断了，脚镣也被他弄碎了；总没有人能制伏他。
{Mar 5:5}   Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.
{Mar 5:5}   他昼夜常在坟茔里和山中喊叫，又用石头砍自己。
{Mar 5:6}   And when he saw Jesus from afar, /a'far/[远处] he ran and fell down before him.
{Mar 5:6}   他远远的看见耶稣，就跑过去拜他，
{Mar 5:7}   And crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure /a'dZUr/[恳求] you by God, do not torment [受苦 折磨] me."
{Mar 5:7}   大声呼叫说：“至高神的儿子耶稣，我与你有什么相干？我指着神恳求你，不要叫我受苦！”
{Mar 5:8}   For he was saying to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"
{Mar 5:8}   是因耶稣曾吩咐他说：“污鬼啊，从这人身上出来吧！”
{Mar 5:9}   And Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "My name is Legion, /lEdZicn/[众多] for we are many."
{Mar 5:9}   耶稣问他说：“你名叫什么？”回答说：“我名叫‘群’，因为我们多的缘故”；
{Mar 5:10}  And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country.
{Mar 5:10}  就再三的求耶稣，不要叫他们离开那地方。
{Mar 5:11}  Now a great herd /hcrd/[成群] of pigs was feeding there on the hillside,
{Mar 5:11}  在那里山坡上，有一大群猪吃食；
{Mar 5:12}  and they begged him, saying, "Send us to the pigs; let us enter them."
{Mar 5:12}  鬼就央求耶稣说：“求你打发我们往猪群里，附着猪去。”
{Mar 5:13}  So he gave them permission. /pcr'miSCn/[许可] And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep /stEp/[陡峭] bank into the sea and drowned /draun/[淹没] in the sea.
{Mar 5:13}  耶稣准了他们，污鬼就出来，进入猪里去。于是那群猪闯下山崖，投在海里，淹死了。猪的数目约有二千。
{Mar 5:14}  The herdsmen [牧夫] fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened.
{Mar 5:14}  放猪的就逃跑了，去告诉城里和乡下的人。众人就来，要看是什么事。
{Mar 5:15}  And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.
{Mar 5:15}  他们来到耶稣那里，看见那被鬼附着的人，就是从前被群鬼所附的，坐着，穿上衣服，心里明白过来，他们就害怕。
{Mar 5:16}  And those who had seen it described /dE'skrIb/[描写] to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs.
{Mar 5:16}  看见这事的，便将鬼附之人所遇见的和那群猪的事都告诉了众人；
{Mar 5:17}  And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region.
{Mar 5:17}  众人就央求耶稣离开他们的境界。
{Mar 5:18}  As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him.
{Mar 5:18}  耶稣上船的时候，那从前被鬼附着的人恳求和耶稣同在。
{Mar 5:19}  And he did not permit him but said to him, "Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."
{Mar 5:19}  耶稣不许，却对他说：“你回家去，到你的亲属那里，将主为你所做的是何等大的事，是怎样怜悯你，都告诉他们。”
{Mar 5:20}  And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis /dE'kxpClis/ how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.
{Mar 5:20}  那人就走了，在低加波利传扬耶稣为他做了何等大的事，众人就都希奇。
{Mar 5:21}  And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea.
{Mar 5:21}  耶稣坐船又渡到那边去，就有许多人到他那里聚集；他正在海边上。
{Mar 5:22}  Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus /dZAIrCs/ by name, [phr.prep. 名叫] and seeing him, he fell at his feet
{Mar 5:22}  有一个管会堂的人，名叫睚鲁，来见耶稣，就俯伏在他脚前，
{Mar 5:23}  and implored /im'plor/[乞求] him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live."
{Mar 5:23}  再三的求他，说：“我的小女儿快要死了，求你去按手在他身上，使他痊愈，得以活了。”
{Mar 5:24}  And he went with him. And a great crowd followed him and thronged /throN/[拥挤] about him.
{Mar 5:24}  耶稣就和他同去。有许多人跟随拥挤他。
{Mar 5:25}  And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years,
{Mar 5:25}  有一个女人，患了十二年的血漏，
{Mar 5:26}  and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse.
{Mar 5:26}  在好些医生手里受了许多的苦，又花尽了他所有的，一点也不见好，病势反倒更重了。
{Mar 5:27}  She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.
{Mar 5:27}  他听见耶稣的事，就从后头来，杂在众人中间，摸耶稣的衣裳，
{Mar 5:28}  For she said, "If I touch even his garments, I will be made well."
{Mar 5:28}  意思说：“我只摸他的衣裳，就必痊愈。”
{Mar 5:29}  And immediately the flow /flO/[流动] of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.
{Mar 5:29}  于是他血漏的源头立刻干了；他便觉得身上的灾病好了。
{Mar 5:30}  And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about [phr.v. 转变] in the crowd and said, "Who touched my garments?"
{Mar 5:30}  耶稣顿时心里觉得有能力从自己身上出去，就在众人中间转过来，说：“谁摸我的衣裳？”
{Mar 5:31}  And his disciples said to him, "You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, 'Who touched me?'"
{Mar 5:31}  门徒对他说：“你看众人拥挤你，还说‘谁摸我’吗？”
{Mar 5:32}  And he looked around to see who had done it.
{Mar 5:32}  耶稣周围观看，要见做这事的女人。
{Mar 5:33}  But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling /trembl/[颤抖] and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. /trwth/
{Mar 5:33}  那女人知道在自己身上所成的事，就恐惧战兢，来俯伏在耶稣跟前，将实情全告诉他。
{Mar 5:34}  And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease."
{Mar 5:34}  耶稣对他说：“女儿，你的信救了你，平平安安的回去吧！你的灾病痊愈了。”
{Mar 5:35}  While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, "Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?" /fcrdhcr/
{Mar 5:35}  还说话的时候，有人从管会堂的家里来，说：“你的女儿死了，何必还劳动先生呢？”
{Mar 5:36}  But overhearing /Ovcr'hEr/[无意听到] what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Do not fear, only believe."
{Mar 5:36}  耶稣听见所说的话，就对管会堂的说：“不要怕，只要信！”
{Mar 5:37}  And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
{Mar 5:37}  于是带着彼得、雅各、和雅各的兄弟约翰同去，不许别人跟随他。
{Mar 5:38}  They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, /kC'mOSCn/[骚乱] people weeping and wailing /wAl/[哀号] loudly. [大声地]
{Mar 5:38}  他们来到管会堂的家里；耶稣看见那里乱嚷，并有人大大的哭泣哀号，
{Mar 5:39}  And when he had entered, he said to them, "Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping."
{Mar 5:39}  进到里面，就对他们说：“为什么乱嚷哭泣呢？孩子不是死了，是睡着了。”
{Mar 5:40}  And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was.
{Mar 5:40}  他们就嗤笑耶稣。耶稣把他们都撵出去，就带着孩子的父母，和跟随的人进了孩子所在的地方，
{Mar 5:41}  Taking her by the hand he said to her, "Talitha cumi," which means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise."
{Mar 5:41}  就拉着孩子的手，对他说：“大利大，古米！”（翻出来就是说：“闺女，我吩咐你起来！”）
{Mar 5:42}  And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome [征服] with amazement.
{Mar 5:42}  那闺女立时起来走。他们就大大的惊奇；闺女已经十二岁了。
{Mar 5:43}  And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.
{Mar 5:43}  耶稣切切的嘱咐他们，不要叫人知道这事，又吩咐给他东西吃。
{Mar 6:1}   He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.
{Mar 6:1}   耶稣离开那里，来到自己的家乡；门徒也跟从他。
{Mar 6:2}   And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands?
{Mar 6:2}   到了安息日，他在会堂里教训人。众人听见，就甚希奇，说：“这人从那里有这些事呢？所赐给他的是什么智慧？他手所做的是何等的异能呢？
{Mar 6:3}   Is not this the carpenter, [源自拉丁文“车匠”] the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses /dZOzes/ and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?" And they took offense /C'fens/[冒犯 反感] at him.
{Mar 6:3}   这不是那木匠吗？不是马利亚的儿子雅各、约西、犹大、西门的长兄吗？他妹妹们不也是在我们这里吗？”他们就厌弃他。（厌弃他：原文作因他跌倒）
{Mar 6:4}   And Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household."
{Mar 6:4}   耶稣对他们说：“大凡先知，除了本地、亲属、本家之外，没有不被人尊敬的。”
{Mar 6:5}   And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.
{Mar 6:5}   耶稣就在那里不得行什么异能，不过按手在几个病人身上，治好他们。
{Mar 6:6}   And he marveled because of their unbelief. /cnbE'lEf/[不信] And he went about among the villages teaching.
{Mar 6:6}   他也诧异他们不信，就往周围乡村教训人去了。
{Mar 6:7}   And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.
{Mar 6:7}   耶稣叫了十二个门徒来，差遣他们两个两个的出去，也赐给他们权柄，制伏污鬼；
{Mar 6:8}   He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—
{Mar 6:8}   并且嘱咐他们：“行路的时候不要带食物和口袋，腰袋里也不要带钱，除了拐杖以外，什么都不要带；
{Mar 6:9}   but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.
{Mar 6:9}   只要穿鞋，也不要穿两件褂子”，
{Mar 6:10}  And he said to them, "Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there.
{Mar 6:10}  又对他们说：“你们无论到何处，进了人的家，就住在那里，直到离开那地方。
{Mar 6:11}  And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them."
{Mar 6:11}  何处的人不接待你们，不听你们，你们离开那里的时候，就把脚上的尘土跺下去，对他们作见证。”
{Mar 6:12}  So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent.
{Mar 6:12}  门徒就出去传道，叫人悔改，
{Mar 6:13}  And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.
{Mar 6:13}  又赶出许多的鬼，用油抹了许多病人，治好他们。
{Mar 6:14}  King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous /mi'rxkUlcs/[不可思议] powers are at work in him."
{Mar 6:14}  耶稣的名声传扬出来。希律王听见了，就说：“施洗的约翰从死里复活了，所以这些异能由他里面发出来。”
{Mar 6:15}  But others said, "He is Elijah." And others said, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old."
{Mar 6:15}  但别人说：“是以利亚。”又有人说：“是先知，正像先知中的一位。”
{Mar 6:16}  But when Herod heard of it, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, /bE'hed/[砍头] has been raised."
{Mar 6:16}  希律听见却说：“是我所斩的约翰，他复活了。”
{Mar 6:17}  For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, /he'rOdias/ his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her.
{Mar 6:17}  先是希律为他兄弟腓力的妻子希罗底的缘故，差人去拿住约翰，锁在监里，因为希律已经娶了那妇人。
{Mar 6:18}  For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
{Mar 6:18}  约翰曾对希律说：“你娶你兄弟的妻子是不合理的。”
{Mar 6:19}  And Herodias had a grudge /grCdZ/[怀恨] against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not,
{Mar 6:19}  于是希罗底怀恨他，想要杀他，只是不能；
{Mar 6:20}  for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, /pcr'pleks/[困惑] and yet he heard him gladly.
{Mar 6:20}  因为希律知道约翰是义人，是圣人，所以敬畏他，保护他，听他讲论，就多照着行（有古卷：游移不定），并且乐意听他。
{Mar 6:21}  But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military /militxry/[军队的] commanders /kC'mxndcr/[命令者] and the leading men of Galilee.
{Mar 6:21}  有一天，恰巧是希律的生日，希律摆设筵席，请了大臣和千夫长，并加利利作首领的。
{Mar 6:22}  For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you."
{Mar 6:22}  希罗底的女儿进来跳舞，使希律和同席的人都欢喜。王就对女子说：“你随意向我求什么，我必给你；”
{Mar 6:23}  And he vowed /vau/[起誓] to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."
{Mar 6:23}  又对他起誓说：“随你向我求什么，就是我国的一半，我也必给你。”
{Mar 6:24}  And she went out and said to her mother, "For what should I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist."
{Mar 6:24}  他就出去对他母亲说：“我可以求什么呢？”他母亲说：“施洗约翰的头。”
{Mar 6:25}  And she came in immediately with haste /hAst/[急忙] to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter." /plxtcr/[大盘子]
{Mar 6:25}  他就急忙进去见王，求他说：“我愿王立时把施洗约翰的头放在盘子里给我。”
{Mar 6:26}  And the king was exceedingly /ek'sEd/[超常] sorry, but because of his oaths /Oth/[誓言] and his guests he did not want to break his word to her.
{Mar 6:26}  王就甚忧愁；但因他所起的誓，又因同席的人，就不肯推辞，
{Mar 6:27}  And immediately the king sent an executioner /eksE'kUSCncr/[死刑执行人] with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison
{Mar 6:27}  随即差一个护卫兵，吩咐拿约翰的头来。护卫兵就去，在监里斩了约翰，
{Mar 6:28}  and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
{Mar 6:28}  把头放在盘子里，拿来给女子，女子就给他母亲。
{Mar 6:29}  When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
{Mar 6:29}  约翰的门徒听见了，就来把他的尸首领去，葬在坟墓里。
{Mar 6:30}  The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught.
{Mar 6:30}  使徒聚集到耶稣那里，将一切所做的事、所传的道全告诉他。
{Mar 6:31}  And he said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while." For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure /LEZcr/[空闲] even to eat.
{Mar 6:31}  他就说：“你们来，同我暗暗的到旷野地方去歇一歇。”这是因为来往的人多，他们连吃饭也没有工夫。
{Mar 6:32}  And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves.
{Mar 6:32}  他们就坐船，暗暗的往旷野地方去。
{Mar 6:33}  Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
{Mar 6:33}  众人看见他们去，有许多认识他们的，就从各城步行，一同跑到那里，比他们先赶到了。
{Mar 6:34}  When he went ashore /a'Sor/[岸] he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion /kCm'pxSCn/[怜悯] on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things.
{Mar 6:34}  耶稣出来，见有许多的人，就怜悯他们，因为他们如同羊没有牧人一般，于是开口教训他们许多道理。
{Mar 6:35}  And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late.
{Mar 6:35}  天已经晚了，门徒进前来，说：“这是野地，天已经晚了，
{Mar 6:36}  Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."
{Mar 6:36}  请叫众人散开，他们好往四面乡村里去，自己买什么吃。”
{Mar 6:37}  But he answered them, "You give them something to eat." And they said to him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?"
{Mar 6:37}  耶稣回答说：“你们给他们吃吧。”门徒说：“我们可以去买二十两银子的饼，给他们吃吗？”
{Mar 6:38}  And he said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and see." And when they had found out, they said, "Five, and two fish."
{Mar 6:38}  耶稣说：“你们有多少饼，可以去看看。”他们知道了，就说：“五个饼，两条鱼。”
{Mar 6:39}  Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.
{Mar 6:39}  耶稣吩咐他们，叫众人一帮一帮的坐在青草地上。
{Mar 6:40}  So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
{Mar 6:40}  众人就一排一排的坐下，有一百一排的，有五十一排的。
{Mar 6:41}  And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all.
{Mar 6:41}  耶稣拿着这五个饼，两条鱼，望着天祝福，擘开饼，递给门徒，摆在众人面前，也把那两条鱼分给众人。
{Mar 6:42}  And they all ate and were satisfied.
{Mar 6:42}  他们都吃，并且吃饱了。
{Mar 6:43}  And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.
{Mar 6:43}  门徒就把碎饼碎鱼收拾起来，装满了十二个篮子。
{Mar 6:44}  And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
{Mar 6:44}  吃饼的男人共有五千。
{Mar 6:45}  Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed /dis'mis/[解散] the crowd.
{Mar 6:45}  耶稣随即催门徒上船，先渡到那边伯赛大去，等他叫众人散开。
{Mar 6:46}  And after he had taken leave of [phr.v. 辞别] them, he went up on the mountain to pray.
{Mar 6:46}  他既辞别了他们，就往山上去祷告。
{Mar 6:47}  And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land.
{Mar 6:47}  到了晚上，船在海中，耶稣独自在岸上；
{Mar 6:48}  And he saw that they were making headway [前进 进展] painfully, /pAn/[痛苦] for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them,
{Mar 6:48}  看见门徒因风不顺，摇橹甚苦。夜里约有四更天，就在海面上走，往他们那里去，意思要走过他们去。
{Mar 6:49}  but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out,
{Mar 6:49}  但门徒看见他在海面上走，以为是鬼怪，就喊叫起来；
{Mar 6:50}  for they all saw him and were terrified. /terifId/[恐惧] But immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid."
{Mar 6:50}  因为他们都看见了他，且甚惊慌。耶稣连忙对他们说：“你们放心！是我，不要怕！”
{Mar 6:51}  And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly [全然] astounded, /as'taund/[震惊]
{Mar 6:51}  于是到他们那里，上了船，风就住了；他们心里十分惊奇。
{Mar 6:52}  for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened. /harden/[坚硬]
{Mar 6:52}  这是因为他们不明白那分饼的事，心里还是愚顽。
{Mar 6:53}  When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret /dZenesaret/ and moored /mOr/[停泊] to the shore. /Sor/
{Mar 6:53}  既渡过去，来到革尼撒勒地方，就靠了岸，
{Mar 6:54}  And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him
{Mar 6:54}  一下船，众人认得是耶稣，
{Mar 6:55}  and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was.
{Mar 6:55}  就跑遍那一带地方，听见他在何处，便将有病的人用褥子抬到那里。
{Mar 6:56}  And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe /frindZ/[边缘] of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.
{Mar 6:56}  凡耶稣所到的地方，或村中，或城里，或乡间，他们都将病人放在街市上，求耶稣只容他们摸他的衣裳䍁子；凡摸着的人就都好了。
{Mar 7:1}   Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem,
{Mar 7:1}   有法利赛人和几个文士从耶路撒冷来，到耶稣那里聚集。
{Mar 7:2}   they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled, /dE'fIl/[弄脏] that is, unwashed. /Cn'waSt/[没有洗过]
{Mar 7:2}   他们曾看见他的门徒中有人用俗手，就是没有洗的手，吃饭。
{Mar 7:3}   (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, [适当地 规矩地] holding to the tradition /tra'diSCn/[传统] of the elders,
{Mar 7:3}   （原来法利赛人和犹太人都拘守古人的遗传，若不仔细洗手就不吃饭；
{Mar 7:4}   and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, /Cb'zcrv/[注意 观测 遵守] such as the washing of cups and pots [小锅] and copper vessels /vesl/[小容器] and dining couches.) /kautS/[长椅]
{Mar 7:4}   从市上来，若不洗浴也不吃饭；还有好些别的规矩，他们历代拘守，就是洗杯、罐、铜器等物。）
{Mar 7:5}   And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?"
{Mar 7:5}   法利赛人和文士问他说：“你的门徒为什么不照古人的遗传，用俗手吃饭呢？”
{Mar 7:6}   And he said to them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy /profEsI/[预言] of you hypocrites, as it is written, "'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;
{Mar 7:6}   耶稣说：“以赛亚指着你们假冒为善之人所说的预言是不错的。如经上说：这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我。
{Mar 7:7}   in vain /vAn/[空洞] do they worship me, teaching as doctrines /doktrin/[教条] the commandments of men.'
{Mar 7:7}   他们将人的吩咐当做道理教导人，所以拜我也是枉然。
{Mar 7:8}   You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men."
{Mar 7:8}   你们是离弃神的诫命，拘守人的遗传”；
{Mar 7:9}   And he said to them, "You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish /e'stxbliS/[坚立] your tradition!
{Mar 7:9}   又说：“你们诚然是废弃神的诫命，要守自己的遗传。
{Mar 7:10}  For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever reviles /rE'vIl/[咒骂] father or mother must surely die.'
{Mar 7:10}  摩西说：‘当孝敬父母’；又说：‘咒骂父母的，必治死他。’
{Mar 7:11}  But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, "Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban"' (that is, given to God)—
{Mar 7:11}  你们倒说：‘人若对父母说：‘我所当奉给你的，已经做了各耳板’（各耳板就是供献的意思），
{Mar 7:12}  then you no longer permit /pcrmit/[许可] him to do anything for his father or mother,
{Mar 7:12}  以后你们就不容他再奉养父母。
{Mar 7:13}  thus making void [真空] the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. [phr.v. 传下去] And many such things you do."
{Mar 7:13}  这就是你们承接遗传，废了神的道。你们还做许多这样的事。”
{Mar 7:14}  And he called the people to him again and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand:
{Mar 7:14}  耶稣又叫众人来，对他们说：“你们都要听我的话，也要明白。
{Mar 7:15}  There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him."
{Mar 7:15}  从外面进去的不能污秽人，惟有从里面出来的乃能污秽人。”
{Mar 7:16}  （有古卷加：有耳可听的，就应当听！）
{Mar 7:16}  （有古卷加：有耳可听的，就应当听！）
{Mar 7:17}  And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable.
{Mar 7:17}  耶稣离开众人，进了屋子，门徒就问他这比喻的意思。
{Mar 7:18}  And he said to them, "Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him,
{Mar 7:18}  耶稣对他们说：“你们也是这样不明白吗？岂不晓得凡从外面进入的，不能污秽人，
{Mar 7:19}  since it enters not his heart but his stomach, /stomak/[胃] and is expelled?" /ek'spel/[排出] (Thus he declared all foods clean.)
{Mar 7:19}  因为不是入他的心，乃是入他的肚腹，又落到茅厕里（这是说，各样的食物都是洁净的）”；
{Mar 7:20}  And he said, "What comes out of a person is what defiles him.
{Mar 7:20}  又说：“从人里面出来的，那才能污秽人；
{Mar 7:21}  For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual /sekSual/ immorality, theft, [偷盗] murder, adultery,
{Mar 7:21}  因为从里面，就是从人心里，发出恶念、苟合、
{Mar 7:22}  coveting, /kovet/[贪婪] wickedness, deceit, sensuality, /senSu'xlity/ envy, slander, /slxndcr/ pride, foolishness.
{Mar 7:22}  偷盗、凶杀、奸淫、贪婪、邪恶、诡诈、淫荡、嫉妒、谤渎、骄傲、狂妄。
{Mar 7:23}  All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person."
{Mar 7:23}  这一切的恶都是从里面出来，且能污秽人。”
{Mar 7:24}  And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden.
{Mar 7:24}  耶稣从那里起身，往推罗、西顿的境内去，进了一家，不愿意人知道，却隐藏不住。
{Mar 7:25}  But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet.
{Mar 7:25}  当下，有一个妇人，他的小女儿被污鬼附着，听见耶稣的事，就来俯伏在他脚前。
{Mar 7:26}  Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
{Mar 7:26}  这妇人是希利尼人，属叙利非尼基族。他求耶稣赶出那鬼离开他的女儿。
{Mar 7:27}  And he said to her, "Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw /thrO/ it to the dogs."
{Mar 7:27}  耶稣对他说：“让儿女们先吃饱，不好拿儿女的饼丢给狗吃。”
{Mar 7:28}  But she answered him, "Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." /krCm/[碎屑]
{Mar 7:28}  妇人回答说：“主啊，不错；但是狗在桌子底下也吃孩子们的碎渣儿。”
{Mar 7:29}  And he said to her, "For this statement [陈述 声明] you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter."
{Mar 7:29}  耶稣对他说：“因这句话，你回去吧；鬼已经离开你的女儿了。”
{Mar 7:30}  And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.
{Mar 7:30}  他就回家去，见小孩子躺在床上，鬼已经出去了。
{Mar 7:31}  Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through /thrw/ Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis. /dE'kxpClis/
{Mar 7:31}  耶稣又离了推罗的境界，经过西顿，就从低加波利境内来到加利利海。
{Mar 7:32}  And they brought to him a man who was deaf /def/[聋] and had a speech impediment, /im'pediment/[障碍] and they begged him to lay his hand on him.
{Mar 7:32}  有人带着一个耳聋舌结的人来见耶稣，求他按手在他身上。
{Mar 7:33}  And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting /spit/[吐] touched his tongue. /tCN/
{Mar 7:33}  耶稣领他离开众人，到一边去，就用指头探他的耳朵，吐唾沫抹他的舌头，
{Mar 7:34}  And looking up to heaven, he sighed /sIn/[叹息] and said to him, "Ephphatha," that is, "Be opened."
{Mar 7:34}  望天叹息，对他说：“以法大！”就是说：“开了吧！”
{Mar 7:35}  And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. /plAn/[平原 坦白 清楚]
{Mar 7:35}  他的耳朵就开了，舌结也解了，说话也清楚了。
{Mar 7:36}  And Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously /zelcs/[热衷] they proclaimed it.
{Mar 7:36}  耶稣嘱咐他们不要告诉人；但他越发嘱咐，他们越发传扬开了。
{Mar 7:37}  And they were kastonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
{Mar 7:37}  众人分外希奇，说：“他所做的事都好，他连聋子也叫他们听见，哑巴也叫他们说话。”
{Mar 8:1}   In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him and said to them,
{Mar 8:1}   那时，又有许多人聚集，并没有什么吃的。耶稣叫门徒来，说：
{Mar 8:2}   "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat.
{Mar 8:2}   “我怜悯这众人；因为他们同我在这里已经三天，也没有吃的了。
{Mar 8:3}   And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint /fAnt/[昏倒] on the way. And some of them have come from far away."
{Mar 8:3}   我若打发他们饿着回家，就必在路上困乏，因为其中有从远处来的。”
{Mar 8:4}   And his disciples answered him, "How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place?"
{Mar 8:4}   门徒回答说：“在这野地，从那里能得饼，叫这些人吃饱呢？”
{Mar 8:5}   And he asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven."
{Mar 8:5}   耶稣问他们说：“你们有多少饼？”他们说：“七个。”
{Mar 8:6}   And he directed /di'rekt/[指导] the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd.
{Mar 8:6}   他吩咐众人坐在地上，就拿着这七个饼祝谢了，擘开，递给门徒，叫他们摆开，门徒就摆在众人面前。
{Mar 8:7}   And they had a few small fish. And having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before them.
{Mar 8:7}   又有几条小鱼；耶稣祝了福，就吩咐也摆在众人面前。
{Mar 8:8}   And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, [phr.v. 剩下] seven baskets full.
{Mar 8:8}   众人都吃，并且吃饱了，收拾剩下的零碎，有七筐子。
{Mar 8:9}   And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away.
{Mar 8:9}   人数约有四千。耶稣打发他们走了，
{Mar 8:10}  And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.
{Mar 8:10}  随即同门徒上船，来到大玛努他境内。
{Mar 8:11}  The Pharisees came and began to argue /argU/[辩论] with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him.
{Mar 8:11}  法利赛人出来盘问耶稣，求他从天上显个神迹给他们看，想要试探他。
{Mar 8:12}  And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation."
{Mar 8:12}  耶稣心里深深的叹息，说：“这世代为什么求神迹呢？我实在告诉你们，没有神迹给这世代看。”
{Mar 8:13}  And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.
{Mar 8:13}  他就离开他们，又上船往海那边去了。
{Mar 8:14}  Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
{Mar 8:14}  门徒忘了带饼；在船上除了一个饼，没有别的食物。
{Mar 8:15}  And he cautioned /koSCn/[警戒] them, saying, "Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."
{Mar 8:15}  耶稣嘱咐他们说：“你们要谨慎，防备法利赛人的酵和希律的酵。”
{Mar 8:16}  And they began discussing /dis'kcs/[讨论] with one another the fact [事实] that they had no bread.
{Mar 8:16}  他们彼此议论说：“这是因为我们没有饼吧。”
{Mar 8:17}  And Jesus, aware /a'wAr/[意识出] of this, said to them, "Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
{Mar 8:17}  耶稣看出来，就说：“你们为什么因为没有饼就议论呢？你们还不省悟，还不明白吗？你们的心还是愚顽吗？
{Mar 8:18}  Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?
{Mar 8:18}  你们有眼睛，看不见吗？有耳朵，听不见吗？也不记得吗？
{Mar 8:19}  When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?" They said to him, "Twelve."
{Mar 8:19}  我擘开那五个饼分给五千人，你们收拾的零碎装满了多少篮子呢？”他们说：“十二个。”
{Mar 8:20}  "And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?" And they said to him, "Seven."
{Mar 8:20}  “又擘开那七个饼分给四千人，你们收拾的零碎装满了多少筐子呢？”他们说：“七个。”
{Mar 8:21}  And he said to them, "Do you not yet understand?"
{Mar 8:21}  耶稣说：“你们还是不明白吗？”
{Mar 8:22}  And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him.
{Mar 8:22}  他们来到伯赛大，有人带一个瞎子来，求耶稣摸他。
{Mar 8:23}  And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, "Do you see anything?"
{Mar 8:23}  耶稣拉着瞎子的手，领他到村外，就吐唾沫在他眼睛上，按手在他身上，问他说：“你看见什么了？”
{Mar 8:24}  And he looked up and said, "I see people, but they look like trees, walking."
{Mar 8:24}  他就抬头一看，说：“我看见人了；他们好像树木，并且行走。”
{Mar 8:25}  Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
{Mar 8:25}  随后又按手在他眼睛上，他定睛一看，就复了原，样样都看得清楚了。
{Mar 8:26}  And he sent him to his home, saying, "Do not even enter the village."
{Mar 8:26}  耶稣打发他回家，说：“连这村子你也不要进去。”
{Mar 8:27}  And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"
{Mar 8:27}  耶稣和门徒出去，往该撒利亚腓立比的村庄去；在路上问门徒说：“人说我是谁？”
{Mar 8:28}  And they told him, "John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets."
{Mar 8:28}  他们说：“有人说是施洗的约翰；有人说是以利亚；又有人说是先知里的一位。”
{Mar 8:29}  And he asked them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered him, "You are the Christ."
{Mar 8:29}  又问他们说：“你们说我是谁？”彼得回答说：“你是基督。”
{Mar 8:30}  And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.
{Mar 8:30}  耶稣就禁戒他们，不要告诉人。
{Mar 8:31}  And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again.
{Mar 8:31}  从此，他教训他们说：“人子必须受许多的苦，被长老、祭司长，和文士弃绝，并且被杀，过三天复活。”
{Mar 8:32}  And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
{Mar 8:32}  耶稣明明的说这话，彼得就拉着他，劝他。
{Mar 8:33}  But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
{Mar 8:33}  耶稣转过来，看着门徒，就责备彼得说：“撒但，退我后边去吧！因为你不体贴神的意思，只体贴人的意思。”
{Mar 8:34}  And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
{Mar 8:34}  于是叫众人和门徒来，对他们说：“若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我。
{Mar 8:35}  For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it.
{Mar 8:35}  因为，凡要救自己生命（或作：灵魂；下同）的，必丧掉生命；凡为我和福音丧掉生命的，必救了生命。
{Mar 8:36}  For what does it profit /profit/[得益] a man to gain the whole world and forfeit /forfit/[丧失] his soul?
{Mar 8:36}  人就是赚得全世界，赔上自己的生命，有什么益处呢？
{Mar 8:37}  For what can a man give in [phr.上交] return for his soul?
{Mar 8:37}  人还能拿什么换生命呢？
{Mar 8:38}  For whoever is ashamed /a'SAmd/[羞耻] of me and of my words in this adulterous /a'dcltcrcs/[淫乱] and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
{Mar 8:38}  凡在这淫乱罪恶的世代，把我和我的道当做可耻的，人子在他父的荣耀里，同圣天使降临的时候，也要把那人当做可耻的。”
{Mar 9:1}   And he said to them, "Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power."
{Mar 9:1}   耶稣又对他们说：“我实在告诉你们，站在这里的，有人在没尝死味以前，必要看见神的国大有能力临到。”
{Mar 9:2}   And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured /trxns'figUr/[美化变形] before them,
{Mar 9:2}   过了六天，耶稣带着彼得、雅各、约翰暗暗的上了高山，就在他们面前变了形像，
{Mar 9:3}   and his clothes /klOths/[衣服] became radiant, /rAdiant/[放光] intensely /in'tens/[强烈 极其] white, as no one on earth could bleach /blEtS/[漂白] them.
{Mar 9:3}   衣服放光，极其洁白，地上漂布的，没有一个能漂得那样白
{Mar 9:4}   And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
{Mar 9:4}   忽然，有以利亚同摩西向他们显现，并且和耶稣说话。
{Mar 9:5}   And Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, /tent/[帐篷] one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."
{Mar 9:5}   彼得对耶稣说：“拉比（就是夫子），我们在这里真好！可以搭三座棚，一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。”
{Mar 9:6}   For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified.
{Mar 9:6}   彼得不知道说什么才好，因为他们甚是惧怕。
{Mar 9:7}   And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him."
{Mar 9:7}   有一朵云彩来遮盖他们；也有声音从云彩里出来，说：“这是我的爱子，你们要听他。”
{Mar 9:8}   And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.
{Mar 9:8}   门徒忽然周围一看，不再见一人，只见耶稣同他们在那里。
{Mar 9:9}   And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
{Mar 9:9}   下山的时候，耶稣嘱咐他们说：“人子还没有从死里复活，你们不要将所看见的告诉人。”
{Mar 9:10}  So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean.
{Mar 9:10}  门徒将这话存记在心，彼此议论“从死里复活”是什么意思。
{Mar 9:11}  And they asked him, "Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?"
{Mar 9:11}  他们就问耶稣说：“文士为什么说以利亚必须先来？”
{Mar 9:12}  And he said to them, "Elijah does come first to restore all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? /kCn'temp/[轻视]
{Mar 9:12}  耶稣说：“以利亚固然先来复兴万事；经上不是指着人子说，他要受许多的苦被人轻慢呢？
{Mar 9:13}  But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him."
{Mar 9:13}  我告诉你们，以利亚已经来了，他们也任意待他，正如经上所指着他的话。”
{Mar 9:14}  And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.
{Mar 9:14}  耶稣到了门徒那里，看见有许多人围着他们，又有文士和他们辩论。
{Mar 9:15}  And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him.
{Mar 9:15}  众人一见耶稣，都甚希奇，就跑上去问他的安。
{Mar 9:16}  And he asked them, "What are you arguing about with them?"
{Mar 9:16}  耶稣问他们说：“你们和他们辩论的是什么？”
{Mar 9:17}  And someone from the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute.
{Mar 9:17}  众人中间有一个人回答说：“夫子，我带了我的儿子到你这里来，他被哑巴鬼附着。
{Mar 9:18}  And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams /fOm/ and grinds /grInd/ his teeth and becomes rigid. /ridZid/[僵硬] So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able."
{Mar 9:18}  无论在那里，鬼捉弄他，把他摔倒，他就口中流沫，咬牙切齿，身体枯干。我请过你的门徒把鬼赶出去，他们却是不能。”
{Mar 9:19}  And he answered them, "O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me."
{Mar 9:19}  耶稣说：“嗳！不信的世代啊，我在你们这里要到几时呢？我忍耐你们要到几时呢？把他带到我这里来吧。”
{Mar 9:20}  And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed /kCn'vcls/[抽搐] the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.
{Mar 9:20}  他们就带了他来。他一见耶稣，鬼便叫他重重的抽疯，倒在地上，翻来覆去，口中流沫。
{Mar 9:21}  And Jesus asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he said, "From childhood.
{Mar 9:21}  耶稣问他父亲说：“他得这病有多少日子呢？”回答说：“从小的时候。
{Mar 9:22}  And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us."
{Mar 9:22}  鬼屡次把他扔在火里、水里，要灭他。你若能做什么，求你怜悯我们，帮助我们。”
{Mar 9:23}  And Jesus said to him, "'If you can'! All things are possible for one who believes."
{Mar 9:23}  耶稣对他说：“你若能信，在信的人，凡事都能。”
{Mar 9:24}  Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I believe; help my unbelief!"
{Mar 9:24}  孩子的父亲立时喊着说（有古卷：立时流泪地喊着说）：“我信！但我信不足，求主帮助。”
{Mar 9:25}  And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."
{Mar 9:25}  耶稣看见众人都跑上来，就斥责那污鬼说：“你这聋哑的鬼，我吩咐你从他里头出来，再不要进去！”
{Mar 9:26}  And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, /korps/[尸体] so that most of them said, "He is dead."
{Mar 9:26}  那鬼喊叫，使孩子大大的抽了一阵疯，就出来了。孩子好像死了一般。以致众人多半说：“他是死了。”
{Mar 9:27}  But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.
{Mar 9:27}  但耶稣拉着他的手，扶他起来，他就站起来了。
{Mar 9:28}  And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why could we not cast it out?"
{Mar 9:28}  耶稣进了屋子，门徒就暗暗的问他说：“我们为什么不能赶出他去呢？”
{Mar 9:29}  And he said to them, "This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer."
{Mar 9:29}  耶稣说：“非用祷告（有古卷加：禁食二字），这一类的鬼总不能出来（或作：不能赶出他去来）。”
{Mar 9:30}  They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know,
{Mar 9:30}  他们离开那地方，经过加利利；耶稣不愿意人知道。
{Mar 9:31}  for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise."
{Mar 9:31}  于是教训门徒，说：“人子将要被交在人手里，他们要杀害他；被杀以后，过三天他要复活。”
{Mar 9:32}  But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
{Mar 9:32}  门徒却不明白这话，又不敢问他。
{Mar 9:33}  And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, "What were you discussing on the way?"
{Mar 9:33}  他们来到迦百农，耶稣在屋里问门徒说：“你们在路上议论的是什么？”
{Mar 9:34}  But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.
{Mar 9:34}  门徒不做声，因为他们在路上彼此争论谁为大。
{Mar 9:35}  And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, "If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."
{Mar 9:35}  耶稣坐下，叫十二门徒来，说：“若有人愿意做首先的，他必做众人末后的，作众人的用人。”
{Mar 9:36}  And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them,
{Mar 9:36}  于是领过一个小孩子来，叫他站在门徒中间，又抱起他来，对他们说：
{Mar 9:37}  "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me."
{Mar 9:37}  “凡为我名接待一个像这小孩子的，就是接待我；凡接待我的，不是接待我，乃是接待那差我来的。”
{Mar 9:38}  John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us."
{Mar 9:38}  约翰对耶稣说：“夫子，我们看见一个人奉你的名赶鬼，我们就禁止他，因为他不跟从我们。”
{Mar 9:39}  But Jesus said, "Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.
{Mar 9:39}  耶稣说：“不要禁止他；因为没有人奉我名行异能，反倒轻易毁谤我。
{Mar 9:40}  For the one who is not against us is for us.
{Mar 9:40}  不敌挡我们的，就是帮助我们的。
{Mar 9:41}  For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward.
{Mar 9:41}  凡因你们是属基督，给你们一杯水喝的，我实在告诉你们，他不能不得赏赐。”
{Mar 9:42}  "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.
{Mar 9:42}  “凡使这信我的一个小子跌倒的，倒不如把大磨石拴在这人的颈项上，扔在海里。
{Mar 9:43}  And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled /kripl/[残废] than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire.
{Mar 9:43}  倘若你一只手叫你跌倒，就把他砍下来；
{Mar 9:44}  and
{Mar 9:44}  你缺了肢体进入永生，强如有两只手落到地狱，入那不灭的火里去。
{Mar 9:45}  And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame /lAm/[跛足] than with two feet to be thrown into hell.
{Mar 9:45}  倘若你一只脚叫你跌倒，就把他砍下来；
{Mar 9:46}  (which are identical with verse 48)
{Mar 9:46}  你瘸腿进入永生，强如有两只脚被丢在地狱里。
{Mar 9:47}  And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell,
{Mar 9:47}  倘若你一只眼叫你跌倒，就去掉他；你只有一只眼进入神的国，强如有两只眼被丢在地狱里。
{Mar 9:48}  'where their worm /worm/ does not die and the fire is not quenched.' /kwentS/[熄灭]
{Mar 9:48}  在那里，虫是不死的，火是不灭的。
{Mar 9:49}  For everyone will be salted with fire.
{Mar 9:49}  因为必用火当盐腌各人。（有古卷加：凡祭物必用盐腌。）
{Mar 9:50}  Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”
{Mar 9:50}  盐本是好的，若失了味，可用什么叫他再咸呢？你们里头应当有盐，彼此和睦。”
{Mar 10:1}  And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gathered to him again. And again, as was his custom, he taught them.
{Mar 10:1}  耶稣从那里起身，来到犹太的境界并约但河外。众人又聚集到他那里，他又照常教训他们。
{Mar 10:2}  And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
{Mar 10:2}  有法利赛人来问他说：“人休妻可以不可以？”意思要试探他。
{Mar 10:3}  He answered them, "What did Moses command you?"
{Mar 10:3}  耶稣回答说：“摩西吩咐你们的是什么？”
{Mar 10:4}  They said, "Moses allowed a man to write a certificate /scr'tifikAt/[证书] of divorce and to send her away."
{Mar 10:4}  他们说：“摩西许人写了休书便可以休妻。”
{Mar 10:5}  And Jesus said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.
{Mar 10:5}  耶稣说：“摩西因为你们的心硬，所以写这条例给你们；
{Mar 10:6}  But from the beginning of creation, /krE'ASCn/ 'God made them male and female.'
{Mar 10:6}  但从起初创造的时候，神造人是造男造女。
{Mar 10:7}  'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife,
{Mar 10:7}  因此，人要离开父母，与妻子连合，二人成为一体。
{Mar 10:8}  and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh.
{Mar 10:8}  既然如此，夫妻不再是两个人，乃是一体的了。
{Mar 10:9}  What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate." /separAt/[切开]
{Mar 10:9}  所以神配合的，人不可分开。”
{Mar 10:10} And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.
{Mar 10:10} 到了屋里，门徒就问他这事。
{Mar 10:11} And he said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her,
{Mar 10:11} 耶稣对他们说：“凡休妻另娶的，就是犯奸淫，辜负他的妻子；
{Mar 10:12} and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."
{Mar 10:12} 妻子若离弃丈夫另嫁，也是犯奸淫了。”
{Mar 10:13} And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them.
{Mar 10:13} 有人带着小孩子来见耶稣，要耶稣摸他们，门徒便责备那些人。
{Mar 10:14} But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant /in'dignant/[愤愤不平] and said to them, "Let the children come to me; do not hinder /hindcr/[妨碍] them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.
{Mar 10:14} 耶稣看见就恼怒，对门徒说：“让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们；因为在神国的，正是这样的人。
{Mar 10:15} Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."
{Mar 10:15} 我实在告诉你们，凡要承受神国的，若不像小孩子，断不能进去。”
{Mar 10:16} And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.
{Mar 10:16} 于是抱着小孩子，给他们按手，为他们祝福。
{Mar 10:17} And as he was setting out [phr.设置出去] on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
{Mar 10:17} 耶稣出来行路的时候，有一个人跑来，跪在他面前，问他说：“良善的夫子，我当做什么事才可以承受永生？”
{Mar 10:18} And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.
{Mar 10:18} 耶稣对他说：“你为什么称我是良善的？除了神一位之外，再没有良善的。
{Mar 10:19} You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, /dE'frod/[诈骗] Honor your father and mother.'"
{Mar 10:19} 诫命你是晓得的：不可杀人；不可奸淫；不可偷盗；不可作假见证；不可亏负人；当孝敬父母。”
{Mar 10:20} And he said to him, "Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth." /Uth/[青少年时期]
{Mar 10:20} 他对耶稣说：“夫子，这一切我从小都遵守了。”
{Mar 10:21} And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, "You lack /lxk/[缺少] one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
{Mar 10:21} 耶稣看着他，就爱他，对他说：“你还缺少一件：去变卖你所有的，分给穷人，就必有财宝在天上；你还要来跟从我。”
{Mar 10:22} Disheartened /dis'harten/[灰心] by the saying, he went away sorrowful, /sorO/[悲伤 伤心] for he had great possessions.
{Mar 10:22} 他听见这话，脸上就变了色，忧忧愁愁的走了，因为他的产业很多。
{Mar 10:23} And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How difficult it will be for those who have wealth /welth/[财富] to enter the kingdom of God!"
{Mar 10:23} 耶稣周围一看，对门徒说：“有钱财的人进神的国是何等的难哪！”
{Mar 10:24} And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, "Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God!
{Mar 10:24} 门徒希奇他的话。耶稣又对他们说：“小子，倚靠钱财的人进神的国是何等的难哪！
{Mar 10:25} It is easier /EzE/ for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
{Mar 10:25} 骆驼穿过针的眼，比财主进神的国还容易呢。”
{Mar 10:26} And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, "Then who can be saved?"
{Mar 10:26} 门徒就分外希奇，对他说：“这样谁能得救呢？”
{Mar 10:27} Jesus looked at them and said, "With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God."
{Mar 10:27} 耶稣看着他们，说：“在人是不能，在神却不然，因为神凡事都能。”
{Mar 10:28} Peter began to say to him, "See, we have left everything and followed you."
{Mar 10:28} 彼得就对他说：“看哪，我们已经撇下所有的跟从你了。”
{Mar 10:29} Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,
{Mar 10:29} 耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们，人为我和福音撇下房屋，或是弟兄、姐妹、父母、儿女、田地，
{Mar 10:30} who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life.
{Mar 10:30} 没有不在今世得百倍的，就是房屋、弟兄、姐妹、母亲、儿女、田地，并且要受逼迫，在来世必得永生。
{Mar 10:31} But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
{Mar 10:31} 然而，有许多在前的，将要在后，在后的，将要在前。”
{Mar 10:32} And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him,
{Mar 10:32} 他们行路上耶路撒冷去。耶稣在前头走，门徒就希奇，跟从的人也害怕。耶稣又叫过十二个门徒来，把自己将要遭遇的事告诉他们说：
{Mar 10:33} saying, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles.
{Mar 10:33} “看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，人子将要被交给祭司长和文士，他们要定他死罪，交给外邦人。
{Mar 10:34} And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise."
{Mar 10:34} 他们要戏弄他，吐唾沫在他脸上，鞭打他，杀害他。过了三天，他要复活。”
{Mar 10:35} And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you."
{Mar 10:35} 西庇太的儿子雅各、约翰进前来，对耶稣说：“夫子，我们无论求你什么，愿你给我们做。”
{Mar 10:36} And he said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
{Mar 10:36} 耶稣说：“要我给你们做什么？”
{Mar 10:37} And they said to him, "Grant /grxnt/[授予] us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory."
{Mar 10:37} 他们说：“赐我们在你的荣耀里，一个坐在你右边，一个坐在你左边。”
{Mar 10:38} Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?"
{Mar 10:38} 耶稣说：“你们不知道所求的是什么，我所喝的杯，你们能喝吗？我所受的洗，你们能受吗？”
{Mar 10:39} And they said to him, "We are able." And Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized,
{Mar 10:39} 他们说：“我们能。”耶稣说：“我所喝的杯，你们也要喝；我所受的洗，你们也要受；
{Mar 10:40} but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared."
{Mar 10:40} 只是坐在我的左右，不是我可以赐的，乃是为谁预备的，就赐给谁。”
{Mar 10:41} And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John.
{Mar 10:41} 那十个门徒听见，就恼怒雅各、约翰。
{Mar 10:42} And Jesus called them to him and said to them, "You know that those who are considered [仔细观察 考虑 认为] rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise /ekscrsIs/[操练] authority over them.
{Mar 10:42} 耶稣叫他们来，对他们说：“你们知道，外邦人有尊为君王的，治理他们，有大臣操权管束他们。
{Mar 10:43} But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant,
{Mar 10:43} 只是在你们中间，不是这样。你们中间，谁愿为大，就必作你们的用人；
{Mar 10:44} and whoever would be first among you must be slave /slAv/[奴隶] of all.
{Mar 10:44} 在你们中间，谁愿为首，就必做众人的仆人。
{Mar 10:45} For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom /rxnsCm/[赎价] for many."
{Mar 10:45} 因为人子来，并不是要受人的服事，乃是要服事人，并且要舍命作多人的赎价。”
{Mar 10:46} And they came to Jericho. /dZerikO/ And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside.
{Mar 10:46} 到了耶利哥；耶稣同门徒并许多人出耶利哥的时候，有一个讨饭的瞎子，是底买的儿子巴底买，坐在路旁。
{Mar 10:47} And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
{Mar 10:47} 他听见是拿撒勒的耶稣，就喊着说：“大卫的子孙耶稣啊！可怜我吧！”
{Mar 10:48} And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, [phr.adv更加] "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
{Mar 10:48} 有许多人责备他，不许他做声。他却越发大声喊着说：“大卫的子孙哪，可怜我吧！”
{Mar 10:49} And Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." And they called the blind man, saying to him, "Take heart. Get up; he is calling you."
{Mar 10:49} 耶稣就站住，说：“叫过他来。”他们就叫那瞎子，对他说：“放心，起来！他叫你啦。”
{Mar 10:50} And throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus.
{Mar 10:50} 瞎子就丢下衣服，跳起来，走到耶稣那里。
{Mar 10:51} And Jesus said to him, "What do you want me to do for you?" And the blind man said to him, "Rabbi, let me recover my sight."
{Mar 10:51} 耶稣说：“要我为你做什么？”瞎子说：“拉波尼（就是夫子），我要能看见。”
{Mar 10:52} And Jesus said to him, "Go your way; your faith has made you well." And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him on the way.
{Mar 10:52} 耶稣说：“你去吧！你的信救了你了。”瞎子立刻看见了，就在路上跟随耶稣。
{Mar 11:1}  Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples
{Mar 11:1}  耶稣和门徒将近耶路撒冷，到了伯法其和伯大尼，在橄榄山那里；耶稣就打发两个门徒，
{Mar 11:2}  and said to them, "Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it.
{Mar 11:2}  对他们说：“你们往对面村子里去，一进去的时候，必看见一匹驴驹拴在那里，是从来没有人骑过的，可以解开，牵来。
{Mar 11:3}  If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.'"
{Mar 11:3}  若有人对你们说：‘为什么做这事？’你们就说：‘主要用他。’那人必立时让你们牵来。”
{Mar 11:4}  And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it.
{Mar 11:4}  他们去了，便看见一匹驴驹拴在门外街道上，就把他解开。
{Mar 11:5}  And some of those standing there said to them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?"
{Mar 11:5}  在那里站着的人，有几个说：“你们解驴驹做什么？”
{Mar 11:6}  And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go.
{Mar 11:6}  门徒照着耶稣所说的回答，那些人就任凭他们牵去了。
{Mar 11:7}  And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it.
{Mar 11:7}  他们把驴驹牵到耶稣那里，把自己的衣服搭在上面，耶稣就骑上。
{Mar 11:8}  And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy /lEfy/[多叶的] branches that they had cut from the fields.
{Mar 11:8}  有许多人把衣服铺在路上，也有人把田间的树枝砍下来，铺在路上。
{Mar 11:9}  And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, "Hosanna! /hO'zxnna/ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
{Mar 11:9}  前行后随的人都喊着说：和散那（和散那：原有求救的意思，在此乃是称颂的话）！奉主名来的是应当称颂的！
{Mar 11:10} Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!"
{Mar 11:10} 那将要来的我祖大卫之国是应当称颂的！高高在上和散那！
{Mar 11:11} And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
{Mar 11:11} 耶稣进了耶路撒冷，入了圣殿，周围看了各样物件。天色已晚，就和十二个门徒出城，往伯大尼去了。
{Mar 11:12} On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.
{Mar 11:12} 第二天，他们从伯大尼出来，耶稣饿了。
{Mar 11:13} And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season /sEzcn/[播种季节 调味] for figs.
{Mar 11:13} 远远的看见一棵无花果树，树上有叶子，就往那里去，或者在树上可以找着什么。到了树下，竟找不着什么，不过有叶子，因为不是收无花果的时候。
{Mar 11:14} And he said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard it.
{Mar 11:14} 耶稣就对树说：“从今以后，永没有人吃你的果子。”他的门徒也听见了。
{Mar 11:15} And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons.
{Mar 11:15} 他们来到耶路撒冷。耶稣进入圣殿，赶出殿里做买卖的人，推倒兑换银钱之人的桌子，和卖鸽子之人的凳子；
{Mar 11:16} And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple.
{Mar 11:16} 也不许人拿着器具从殿里经过；
{Mar 11:17} And he was teaching them and saying to them, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den [洞穴] of robbers." /robcr/[强盗]
{Mar 11:17} 便教训他们说：“经上不是记着说：我的殿必称为万国祷告的殿吗？你们倒使他成为贼窝了。”
{Mar 11:18} And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching.
{Mar 11:18} 祭司长和文士听见这话，就想法子要除灭耶稣，却又怕他，因为众人都希奇他的教训。
{Mar 11:19} And when evening came they went out of the city.
{Mar 11:19} 每天晚上，耶稣出城去。
{Mar 11:20} As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away [phr.枯干] to its roots. /rwt/
{Mar 11:20} 早晨，他们从那里经过，看见无花果树连根都枯干了。
{Mar 11:21} And Peter remembered and said to him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed /kcrs/[咒诅] has withered."
{Mar 11:21} 彼得想起耶稣的话来，就对他说：“拉比，请看！你所咒诅的无花果树，已经枯干了。”
{Mar 11:22} And Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.
{Mar 11:22} 耶稣回答说：“你们当信服神。
{Mar 11:23} Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' and does not doubt /daut/[怀疑] in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, [phr.通过 实现 发生] it will be done for him.
{Mar 11:23} 我实在告诉你们，无论何人对这座山说：‘你挪开此地，投在海里！’他若心里不疑惑，只信他所说的必成，就必给他成了。
{Mar 11:24} Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
{Mar 11:24} 所以我告诉你们，凡你们祷告祈求的，无论是什么，只要信是得着的，就必得着。
{Mar 11:25} And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses." /trespas/[过犯]
{Mar 11:25} 你们站着祷告的时候，若想起有人得罪你们，就当饶恕他，好叫你们在天上的父也饶恕你们的过犯。
{Mar 11:26} But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
{Mar 11:26} 你们若不饶恕人，你们在天上的父也不饶恕你们的过犯。（有古卷无此节）”
{Mar 11:27} And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him,
{Mar 11:27} 他们又来到耶路撒冷。耶稣在殿里行走的时候，祭司长和文士并长老进前来，
{Mar 11:28} and they said to him, "By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?"
{Mar 11:28} 问他说：“你仗着什么权柄做这些事？给你这权柄的是谁呢？”
{Mar 11:29} Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
{Mar 11:29} 耶稣对他们说：“我要问你们一句话，你们回答我，我就告诉你们我仗着什么权柄做这些事。
{Mar 11:30} Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me."
{Mar 11:30} 约翰的洗礼是从天上来的？是从人间来的呢？你们可以回答我。”
{Mar 11:31} And they discussed it with one another, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
{Mar 11:31} 他们彼此商议说：“我们若说‘从天上来’，他必说：‘这样，你们为什么不信他呢？’
{Mar 11:32} But shall we say, 'From man'?"—they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really /rEally/ was a prophet.
{Mar 11:32} 若说‘从人间来’，却又怕百姓，因为众人真以约翰为先知。”
{Mar 11:33} So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”
{Mar 11:33} 于是回答耶稣说：“我们不知道。”耶稣说：“我也不告诉你们我仗着什么权柄做这些事。”
{Mar 12:1}  And he began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard /vinyard/ and put a fence /fens/[篱笆] around it and dug a pit [坑] for the winepress /wInpres/[葡萄榨汁器] and built a tower, /taur/[塔] and leased /lEs/[出租] it to tenants /tenant/[租客] and went into another country.
{Mar 12:1}  耶稣就用比喻对他们说：“有人栽了一个葡萄园，周围圈上篱笆，挖了一个压酒池，盖了一座楼，租给园户，就往外国去了。
{Mar 12:2}  When the season came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
{Mar 12:2}  到了时候，打发一个仆人到园户那里，要从园户收葡萄园的果子。
{Mar 12:3}  And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
{Mar 12:3}  园户拿住他，打了他，叫他空手回去。
{Mar 12:4}  Again he sent to them another servant, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully.
{Mar 12:4}  再打发一个仆人到他们那里。他们打伤他的头，并且凌辱他。
{Mar 12:5}  And he sent another, and him they killed. And so with many others: some they beat, and some they killed.
{Mar 12:5}  又打发一个仆人去，他们就杀了他。后又打发好些仆人去，有被他们打的，有被他们杀的。
{Mar 12:6}  He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect /rE'spkt/[尊敬] my son.'
{Mar 12:6}  园主还有一位是他的爱子，末后又打发他去，意思说：‘他们必尊敬我的儿子。’
{Mar 12:7}  But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. /Ar/[继承人] Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance /in'heritans/[继承物] will be ours.'
{Mar 12:7}  不料，那些园户彼此说：‘这是承受产业的。来吧，我们杀他，产业就归我们了！’
{Mar 12:8}  And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.
{Mar 12:8}  于是拿住他，杀了他，把他丢在园外。
{Mar 12:9}  What will the owner /Oncr/[拥有者] of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.
{Mar 12:9}  这样，葡萄园的主人要怎样办呢？他要来除灭那些园户，将葡萄园转给别人。
{Mar 12:10} Have you not read this Scripture: "'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;
{Mar 12:10} 经上写着说：匠人所弃的石头，已作了房角的头块石头。
{Mar 12:11} this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous /marvlcs/[惊奇] in our eyes'?"
{Mar 12:11} 这是主所做的，在我们眼中看为希奇。这经你们没有念过吗？”
{Mar 12:12} And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the people, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them. So they left him and went away.
{Mar 12:12} 他们看出这比喻是指着他们说的，就想要捉拿他，只是惧怕百姓，于是离开他走了。
{Mar 12:13} And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to trap /trxp/[陷阱] him in his talk.
{Mar 12:13} 后来，他们打发几个法利赛人和几个希律党的人到耶稣那里，要就着他的话陷害他。
{Mar 12:14} And they came and said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone's opinion. /C'pinicn/[主观意见] For you are not swayed /swA/[摇动] by appearances, /a'pErans/[外表] but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?"
{Mar 12:14} 他们来了，就对他说：“夫子，我们知道你是诚实的，什么人你都不徇情面；因为你不看人的外貌，乃是诚诚实实传神的道。纳税给该撒可以不可以？
{Mar 12:15} But, knowing their hypocrisy, /hi'pokrisy/[伪善] he said to them, "Why put me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it."
{Mar 12:15} 我们该纳不该纳？”耶稣知道他们的假意，就对他们说：“你们为什么试探我？拿一个银钱来给我看！”
{Mar 12:16} And they brought one. And he said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" They said to him, "Caesar's."
{Mar 12:16} 他们就拿了来。耶稣说：“这像和这号是谁的？”他们说：“是该撒的。”
{Mar 12:17} Jesus said to them, "Render /rendcr/[归给] to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they marveled at him.
{Mar 12:17} 耶稣说：“该撒的物当归给该撒，神的物当归给神。”他们就很希奇他。
{Mar 12:18} And Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection. And they asked him a question, saying,
{Mar 12:18} 撒都该人常说没有复活的事。他们来问耶稣说：
{Mar 12:19} "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
{Mar 12:19} “夫子，摩西为我们写着说：‘人若死了，撇下妻子，没有孩子，他兄弟当娶他的妻，为哥哥生子立后。’
{Mar 12:20} There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no offspring.
{Mar 12:20} 有弟兄七人，第一个娶了妻，死了，没有留下孩子。
{Mar 12:21} And the second took her, and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise.
{Mar 12:21} 第二个娶了他，也死了，没有留下孩子。第三个也是这样。
{Mar 12:22} And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died.
{Mar 12:22} 那七个人都没有留下孩子；末了，那妇人也死了。
{Mar 12:23} In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife."
{Mar 12:23} 当复活的时候，他是那一个的妻子呢？因为他们七个人都娶过他。”
{Mar 12:24} Jesus said to them, "Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?
{Mar 12:24} 耶稣说：“你们所以错了，岂不是因为不明白圣经，不晓得神的大能吗？
{Mar 12:25} For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
{Mar 12:25} 人从死里复活，也不娶也不嫁，乃像天上的使者一样。
{Mar 12:26} And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage /pxsAdZ/[一段文章] about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
{Mar 12:26} 论到死人复活，你们没有念过摩西的书荆棘篇上所载的吗？神对摩西说：‘我是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。’
{Mar 12:27} He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite /kwIt/[完全] wrong."
{Mar 12:27} 神不是死人的神，乃是活人的神。你们是大错了。”
{Mar 12:28} And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing /di'spUt/[争论] with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, "Which commandment is the most important of all?"
{Mar 12:28} 有一个文士来，听见他们辩论，晓得耶稣回答的好，就问他说：“诫命中那是第一要紧的呢？”
{Mar 12:29} Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
{Mar 12:29} 耶稣回答说：“第一要紧的就是说：‘以色列啊，你要听，主我们神是独一的主。
{Mar 12:30} And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'
{Mar 12:30} 你要尽心、尽性、尽意、尽力爱主你的神。’
{Mar 12:31} The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."
{Mar 12:31} 其次就是说：‘要爱人如己。’再没有比这两条诫命更大的了。”
{Mar 12:32} And the scribe said to him, "You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him.
{Mar 12:32} 那文士对耶稣说：“夫子说，神是一位，实在不错；除了他以外，再没有别的神；
{Mar 12:33} And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt /bcrnt/[烧过的] offerings /ofcriN/[贡品] and sacrifices." /sxkrifIs/[祭品]
{Mar 12:33} 并且尽心、尽智、尽力爱他，又爱人如己，就比一切燔祭和各样祭祀好的多。”
{Mar 12:34} And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, /wIs/[聪明] he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions.
{Mar 12:34} 耶稣见他回答的有智慧，就对他说：“你离神的国不远了。”从此以后，没有人敢再问他什么。
{Mar 12:35} And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, "How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
{Mar 12:35} 耶稣在殿里教训人，就问他们说：“文士怎么说基督是大卫的子孙呢？
{Mar 12:36} David himself, in the Holy Spirit, declared, "'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet."'
{Mar 12:36} 大卫被圣灵感动，说：主对我主说，你坐在我的右边，等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。
{Mar 12:37} David himself calls him Lord. So how is he his son?" And the great throng /throN/[群众] heard him gladly.
{Mar 12:37} 大卫既自己称他为主，他怎么又是大卫的子孙呢？”众人都喜欢听他。
{Mar 12:38} And in his teaching he said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces
{Mar 12:38} 耶稣在教训之间，说：“你们要防备文士；他们好穿长衣游行，喜爱人在街市上问他们的安，
{Mar 12:39} and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,
{Mar 12:39} 又喜爱会堂里的高位，筵席上的首座。
{Mar 12:40} who devour widows' houses and for a pretense /prE'tens/[虚假] make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation."
{Mar 12:40} 他们侵吞寡妇的家产，假意做很长的祷告。这些人要受更重的刑罚！”
{Mar 12:41} And he sat down opposite /opczit/[对立面] the treasury /treZcry/[宝库] and watched the people putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums. /sCm/[总额]
{Mar 12:41} 耶稣对银库坐着，看众人怎样投钱入库。有好些财主往里投了若干的钱。
{Mar 12:42} And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny.
{Mar 12:42} 有一个穷寡妇来，往里投了两个小钱，就是一个大钱。
{Mar 12:43} And he called his disciples to him and said to them, "Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing /kCn'tribUt/[捐献] to the offering box.
{Mar 12:43} 耶稣叫门徒来，说：“我实在告诉你们，这穷寡妇投入库里的，比众人所投的更多。
{Mar 12:44} For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty /povcrty/[贫困] has put in everything she had, all she had to live on."
{Mar 12:44} 因为，他们都是自己有余，拿出来投在里头；但这寡妇是自己不足，把他一切养生的都投上了。”
{Mar 13:1}  And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!"
{Mar 13:1}  耶稣从殿里出来的时候，有一个门徒对他说：“夫子，请看，这是何等的石头！何等的殿宇！”
{Mar 13:2}  And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down."
{Mar 13:2}  耶稣对他说：“你看见这大殿宇吗？将来在这里没有一块石头留在石头上，不被拆毁了。”
{Mar 13:3}  And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
{Mar 13:3}  耶稣在橄榄山上对圣殿而坐，彼得、雅各、约翰，和安得烈暗暗的问他说：
{Mar 13:4}  "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?"
{Mar 13:4}  “请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事呢？这一切事将成的时候有什么预兆呢？”
{Mar 13:5}  And Jesus began to say to them, "See that no one leads you astray. /a'strA/[迷途地]
{Mar 13:5}  耶稣说：“你们要谨慎，免得有人迷惑你们。
{Mar 13:6}  Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and they will lead many astray.
{Mar 13:6}  将来有好些人冒我的名来，说：‘我是基督’，并且要迷惑许多人。
{Mar 13:7}  And when you hear of wars and rumors /rwmcr/[传闻] of wars, do not be alarmed. /a'larm/[警报 惊慌] This must take place, but the end is not yet.
{Mar 13:7}  你们听见打仗和打仗的风声，不要惊慌。这些事是必须有的，只是末期还没有到。
{Mar 13:8}  For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. /fxmin/ These are but the beginning of the birth pains.
{Mar 13:8}  民要攻打民，国要攻打国；多处必有地震、饥荒。这都是灾难（灾难：原文作生产之难）的起头。
{Mar 13:9}  "But be on your guard. For they will deliver you over to councils, /kaunsil/ and you will be beaten in synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them.
{Mar 13:9}  但你们要谨慎；因为人要把你们交给公会，并且你们在会堂里要受鞭打，又为我的缘故站在诸侯与君王面前，对他们作见证。
{Mar 13:10} And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations.
{Mar 13:10} 然而，福音必须先传给万民。
{Mar 13:11} And when they bring you to trial /trIal/ and deliver you over, do not be anxious /xnkScs/[忧虑] beforehand [事先] what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
{Mar 13:11} 人把你们拉去交官的时候，不要预先思虑说什么；到那时候，赐给你们什么话，你们就说什么；因为说话的不是你们，乃是圣灵。
{Mar 13:12} And brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death.
{Mar 13:12} 弟兄要把弟兄，父亲要把儿子，送到死地；儿女要起来与父母为敌，害死他们；
{Mar 13:13} And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
{Mar 13:13} 并且你们要为我的名被众人恨恶。惟有忍耐到底的，必然得救。”
{Mar 13:14} "But when you see the abomination /a,bomi'nASCn/[可憎之物] of desolation /desO'lASCn/[荒芜] standing where he ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
{Mar 13:14} “你们看见那行毁坏可憎的，站在不当站的地方（读这经的人须要会意）。那时，在犹太的，应当逃到山上；
{Mar 13:15} Let the one who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter his house, to take anything out,
{Mar 13:15} 在房上的，不要下来，也不要进去拿家里的东西；
{Mar 13:16} and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.
{Mar 13:16} 在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳。
{Mar 13:17} And alas /a'lxs/[哎] for women who are pregnant /pregnant/[怀孕 < 生前] and for those who are nursing infants /infant/[婴儿 < 不会说话] in those days!
{Mar 13:17} 当那些日子，怀孕的和奶孩子的有祸了！
{Mar 13:18} Pray that it may not happen in winter.
{Mar 13:18} 你们应当祈求，叫这些事不在冬天临到。
{Mar 13:19} For in those days there will be such tribulation /tribU'lASCn/[苦难 灾难] as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will be.
{Mar 13:19} 因为在那些日子必有灾难，自从神创造万物直到如今，并没有这样的灾难，后来也必没有。
{Mar 13:20} And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being [存在 生物] would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, /E'lekt/[拣选] whom he chose, he shortened /Sort/[短] the days.
{Mar 13:20} 若不是主减少那日子，凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的；只是为主的选民，他将那日子减少了。
{Mar 13:21} And then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.
{Mar 13:21} 那时若有人对你们说：‘看哪，基督在这里’，或说：‘基督在那里’，你们不要信！
{Mar 13:22} For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders, /wcndcr/[奇事] to lead astray, if possible, the elect.
{Mar 13:22} 因为假基督、假先知将要起来，显神迹奇事，倘若能行，就把选民迷惑了。
{Mar 13:23} But be on guard; I have told you all things beforehand.
{Mar 13:23} 你们要谨慎。看哪，凡事我都预先告诉你们了。”
{Mar 13:24} "But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,
{Mar 13:24} “在那些日子，那灾难以后，日头要变黑了，月亮也不放光，
{Mar 13:25} and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
{Mar 13:25} 众星要从天上坠落，天势都要震动。
{Mar 13:26} And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
{Mar 13:26} 那时，他们（马太二十四章三十节是地上的万族）要看见人子有大能力、大荣耀，驾云降临。
{Mar 13:27} And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.
{Mar 13:27} 他要差遣天使，把他的选民，从四方（方：原文作风），从地极直到天边，都招聚了来。”
{Mar 13:28} "From the fig tree learn its lesson: /lesCn/[功课] as soon as its branch becomes tender /tendcr/[娇嫩] and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.
{Mar 13:28} “你们可以从无花果树学个比方：当树枝发嫩长叶的时候，你们就知道夏天近了。
{Mar 13:29} So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates.
{Mar 13:29} 这样，你们几时看见这些事成就，也该知道人子（人子：或作神的国）近了，正在门口了。
{Mar 13:30} Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
{Mar 13:30} 我实在告诉你们，这世代还没有过去，这些事都要成就。
{Mar 13:31} Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
{Mar 13:31} 天地要废去，我的话却不能废去。”
{Mar 13:32} "But concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
{Mar 13:32} “但那日子，那时辰，没有人知道，连天上的使者也不知道，子也不知道，惟有父知道。
{Mar 13:33} Be on guard, keep awake. For you do not know when the time will come.
{Mar 13:33} 你们要谨慎，警醒祈祷，因为你们不晓得那日期几时来到。
{Mar 13:34} It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake.
{Mar 13:34} 这事正如一个人离开本家，寄居外邦，把权柄交给仆人，分派各人当做的工，又吩咐看门的警醒。
{Mar 13:35} Therefore stay awake—for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, /krO/[啼叫] or in the morning—
{Mar 13:35} 所以，你们要警醒；因为你们不知道家主什么时候来，或晚上，或半夜，或鸡叫，或早晨；
{Mar 13:36} lest he come suddenly and find you asleep.
{Mar 13:36} 恐怕他忽然来到，看见你们睡着了。
{Mar 13:37} And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake."
{Mar 13:37} 我对你们所说的话，也是对众人说：要警醒！”
{Mar 14:1}  It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth /stelth/[偷偷地] and kill him,
{Mar 14:1}  过两天是逾越节，又是除酵节，祭司长和文士想法子怎么用诡计捉拿耶稣，杀他。
{Mar 14:2}  for they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar /'cp,ror/[喧嚣] from the people."
{Mar 14:2}  只是说：“当节的日子不可，恐怕百姓生乱。”
{Mar 14:3}  And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster /'xla,bxstcr/[雪花石膏] flask /flxsk/[细颈瓶] of ointment [油膏] of pure nard, very costly, /kost/[花费] and she broke the flask and poured /por/[倾泻] it over his head.
{Mar 14:3}  耶稣在伯大尼长大麻疯的西门家里坐席的时候，有一个女人拿着一玉瓶至贵的真哪哒香膏来，打破玉瓶，把膏浇在耶稣的头上。
{Mar 14:4}  There were some who said to themselves indignantly, "Why was the ointment wasted /wAst/[浪费] like that?
{Mar 14:4}  有几个人心中很不喜悦，说：“何用这样枉费香膏呢？
{Mar 14:5}  For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor." And they scolded /skOld/[责骂] her.
{Mar 14:5}  这香膏可以卖三十多两银子周济穷人。”他们就向那女人生气。
{Mar 14:6}  But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
{Mar 14:6}  耶稣说：“由他吧！为什么难为他呢？他在我身上做的是一件美事。
{Mar 14:7}  For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you will not always have me.
{Mar 14:7}  因为常有穷人和你们同在，要向他们行善随时都可以；只是你们不常有我。
{Mar 14:8}  She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial. /berial/[葬礼]
{Mar 14:8}  他所做的，是尽他所能的；他是为我安葬的事把香膏预先浇在我身上。
{Mar 14:9}  And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her."
{Mar 14:9}  我实在告诉你们，普天之下，无论在什么地方传这福音，也要述说这女人所做的，以为记念。”
{Mar 14:10} Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.
{Mar 14:10} 十二门徒之中，有一个加略人犹大去见祭司长，要把耶稣交给他们。
{Mar 14:11} And when they heard it, they were glad and promised /promis/[承诺] to give him money. And he sought an opportunity /opcr'tUnity/ to betray him.
{Mar 14:11} 他们听见就欢喜，又应许给他银子；他就寻思如何得便把耶稣交给他们。
{Mar 14:12} And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, "Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
{Mar 14:12} 除酵节的第一天，就是宰逾越羊羔的那一天，门徒对耶稣说：“你吃逾越节的筵席要我们往那里去预备呢？”
{Mar 14:13} And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him,
{Mar 14:13} 耶稣就打发两个门徒，对他们说：“你们进城去，必有人拿着一瓶水迎面而来，你们就跟着他。
{Mar 14:14} and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
{Mar 14:14} 他进那家去，你们就对那家的主人说：‘夫子说：客房在那里？我与门徒好在那里吃逾越节的筵席。’
{Mar 14:15} And he will show you a large upper room furnished /fcrniS/[布置] and ready; there prepare for us."
{Mar 14:15} 他必指给你们摆设整齐的一间大楼，你们就在那里为我们预备。”
{Mar 14:16} And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
{Mar 14:16} 门徒出去，进了城，所遇见的正如耶稣所说的。他们就预备了逾越节的筵席。
{Mar 14:17} And when it was evening, he came with the twelve.
{Mar 14:17} 到了晚上，耶稣和十二个门徒都来了。
{Mar 14:18} And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me."
{Mar 14:18} 他们坐席正吃的时候，耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们，你们中间有一个与我同吃的人要卖我了。”
{Mar 14:19} They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, "Is it I?"
{Mar 14:19} 他们就忧愁起来，一个一个的问他说：“是我吗？”
{Mar 14:20} He said to them, "It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping [沾 浸] bread into the dish with me.
{Mar 14:20} 耶稣对他们说：“是十二个门徒中同我蘸手在盘子里的那个人。
{Mar 14:21} For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."
{Mar 14:21} 人子必要去世，正如经上指着他所写的；但卖人子的人有祸了！那人不生在世上倒好。”
{Mar 14:22} And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, "Take; this is my body."
{Mar 14:22} 他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝了福，就擘开，递给他们，说：“你们拿着吃，这是我的身体”；
{Mar 14:23} And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it.
{Mar 14:23} 又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们；他们都喝了。
{Mar 14:24} And he said to them, "This is my blood of the covenant, /kcvenant/[契约] which is poured out for many.
{Mar 14:24} 耶稣说：“这是我立约的血，为多人流出来的。
{Mar 14:25} Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine [藤蔓] until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
{Mar 14:25} 我实在告诉你们，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直到我在神的国里喝新的那日子。”
{Mar 14:26} And when they had sung /sCN/ a hymn, /him/[赞美诗歌] they went out to the Mount of Olives.
{Mar 14:26} 他们唱了诗，就出来，往橄榄山去。
{Mar 14:27} And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
{Mar 14:27} 耶稣对他们说：“你们都要跌倒了，因为经上记着说：我要击打牧人，羊就分散了。
{Mar 14:28} But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."
{Mar 14:28} 但我复活以后，要在你们以先往加利利去。”
{Mar 14:29} Peter said to him, "Even though they all fall away, I will not."
{Mar 14:29} 彼得说：“众人虽然跌倒，我总不能。”
{Mar 14:30} And Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
{Mar 14:30} 耶稣对他说：“我实在告诉你，就在今天夜里，鸡叫两遍以先，你要三次不认我。”
{Mar 14:31} But he said emphatically, /em'fxtik/[强调地] "If I must die with you, I will not deny you." And they all said the same.
{Mar 14:31} 彼得却极力的说：“我就是必须和你同死，也总不能不认你。”众门徒都是这样说。
{Mar 14:32} And they went to a place called Gethsemane. /geth'semanE/ And he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
{Mar 14:32} 他们来到一个地方，名叫客西马尼。耶稣对门徒说：“你们坐在这里，等我祷告。”
{Mar 14:33} And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed /di'stres/[悲痛] and troubled.
{Mar 14:33} 于是带着彼得、雅各、约翰同去，就惊恐起来，极其难过，
{Mar 14:34} And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch."
{Mar 14:34} 对他们说：“我心里甚是忧伤，几乎要死；你们在这里等候，警醒。”
{Mar 14:35} And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
{Mar 14:35} 他就稍往前走，俯伏在地，祷告说：“倘若可行，便叫那时候过去。”
{Mar 14:36} And he said, "Abba, /xba/ Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."
{Mar 14:36} 他说：“阿爸！父啊！在你凡事都能；求你将这杯撤去。然而，不要从我的意思，只要从你的意思。”
{Mar 14:37} And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?
{Mar 14:37} 耶稣回来，见他们睡着了，就对彼得说：“西门，你睡觉吗？不能警醒片时吗？
{Mar 14:38} Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." /wEk/[虚弱]
{Mar 14:38} 总要警醒祷告，免得入了迷惑。你们心灵固然愿意，肉体却软弱了。”
{Mar 14:39} And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.
{Mar 14:39} 耶稣又去祷告，说的话还是与先前一样，
{Mar 14:40} And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him.
{Mar 14:40} 又来见他们睡着了，因为他们的眼睛甚是困倦；他们也不知道怎么回答。
{Mar 14:41} And he came the third time and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
{Mar 14:41} 第三次来，对他们说：“现在你们仍然睡觉安歇吧（吧：或作吗？）！够了，时候到了。看哪，人子被卖在罪人手里了。
{Mar 14:42} Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."
{Mar 14:42} 起来！我们走吧。看哪，那卖我的人近了。”
{Mar 14:43} And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
{Mar 14:43} 说话之间，忽然那十二个门徒里的犹大来了，并有许多人带着刀棒，从祭司长和文士并长老那里与他同来。
{Mar 14:44} Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard."
{Mar 14:44} 卖耶稣的人曾给他们一个暗号，说：“我与谁亲嘴，谁就是他。你们把他拿住，牢牢靠靠的带去。”
{Mar 14:45} And when he came, he went up to him at once and said, "Rabbi!" And he kissed him.
{Mar 14:45} 犹大来了，随即到耶稣跟前，说：“拉比”，便与他亲嘴。
{Mar 14:46} And they laid hands on him and seized him.
{Mar 14:46} 他们就下手拿住他。
{Mar 14:47} But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
{Mar 14:47} 旁边站着的人，有一个拔出刀来，将大祭司的仆人砍了一刀，削掉了他一个耳朵。
{Mar 14:48} And Jesus said to them, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture /kxptScr/[抓捕] me?
{Mar 14:48} 耶稣对他们说：“你们带着刀棒出来拿我，如同拿强盗吗？
{Mar 14:49} Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled."
{Mar 14:49} 我天天教训人，同你们在殿里，你们并没有拿我。但这事成就，为要应验经上的话。”
{Mar 14:50} And they all left him and fled.
{Mar 14:50} 门徒都离开他，逃走了。
{Mar 14:51} And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen [亚麻布] cloth [布] about his body. And they seized him,
{Mar 14:51} 有一个少年人，赤身披着一块麻布，跟随耶稣，众人就捉拿他。
{Mar 14:52} but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked. /nAked/[裸体的]
{Mar 14:52} 他却丢了麻布，赤身逃走了。
{Mar 14:53} And they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.
{Mar 14:53} 他们把耶稣带到大祭司那里，又有众祭司长和长老并文士都来和大祭司一同聚集。
{Mar 14:54} And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire.
{Mar 14:54} 彼得远远的跟着耶稣，一直进入大祭司的院里，和差役一同坐在火光里烤火。
{Mar 14:55} Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none.
{Mar 14:55} 祭司长和全公会寻找见证控告耶稣，要治死他，却寻不着。
{Mar 14:56} For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree.
{Mar 14:56} 因为有好些人做见证告他，只是他们的见证各不相合。
{Mar 14:57} And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,
{Mar 14:57} 又有几个人站起来做假见证告他，说：
{Mar 14:58} "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.'"
{Mar 14:58} “我们听见他说：‘我要拆毁这人手所造的殿，三日内就另造一座不是人手所造的。’”
{Mar 14:59} Yet even about this their testimony did not agree.
{Mar 14:59} 他们就是这么做见证，也是各不相合。
{Mar 14:60} And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"
{Mar 14:60} 大祭司起来站在中间，问耶稣说：“你什么都不回答吗？这些人做见证告你的是什么呢？”
{Mar 14:61} But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
{Mar 14:61} 耶稣却不言语，一句也不回答。大祭司又问他说：“你是那当称颂者的儿子基督不是？”
{Mar 14:62} And Jesus said, "I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."
{Mar 14:62} 耶稣说：“我是。你们必看见人子坐在那权能者的右边，驾着天上的云降临。”
{Mar 14:63} And the high priest tore his garments and said, "What further witnesses do we need?
{Mar 14:63} 大祭司就撕开衣服，说：“我们何必再用见证人呢？
{Mar 14:64} You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?" /dE'siZcn/[决心] And they all condemned him as deserving death.
{Mar 14:64} 你们已经听见他这僭妄的话了。你们的意见如何？”他们都定他该死的罪。
{Mar 14:65} And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, "Prophesy!" /profEsI/[预言] And the guards received him with blows.
{Mar 14:65} 就有人吐唾沫在他脸上，又蒙着他的脸，用拳头打他，对他说：“你说预言吧！”差役接过他来，用手掌打他。
{Mar 14:66} And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came,
{Mar 14:66} 彼得在下边院子里；来了大祭司的一个使女，
{Mar 14:67} and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, "You also were with the Nazarene, /nxza'rEn/ Jesus."
{Mar 14:67} 见彼得烤火，就看着他，说：“你素来也是同拿撒勒人耶稣一夥的。”
{Mar 14:68} But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you mean." And he went out into the gateway [大门处] and the rooster crowed.
{Mar 14:68} 彼得却不承认，说：“我不知道，也不明白你说的是什么。”于是出来，到了前院，鸡就叫了。
{Mar 14:69} And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, [旁边者] "This man is one of them."
{Mar 14:69} 那使女看见他，又对旁边站着的人说：“这也是他们一党的。”
{Mar 14:70} But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, "Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."
{Mar 14:70} 彼得又不承认。过了不多的时候，旁边站着的人又对彼得说：“你真是他们一党的！因为你是加利利人。”
{Mar 14:71} But he began to invoke /in'vOk/[向神灵呼唤] a curse /kcrs/[咒诅] on himself and to swear, /swAr/[发誓] "I do not know this man of whom you speak."
{Mar 14:71} 彼得就发咒起誓的说：“我不认得你们说的这个人。”
{Mar 14:72} And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." And he broke down and wept.
{Mar 14:72} 立时鸡叫了第二遍。彼得想起耶稣对他所说的话：“鸡叫两遍以先，你要三次不认我。”思想起来，就哭了。
{Mar 15:1}  And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation /kcnscl'tASCn/[商议] with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate.
{Mar 15:1}  一到早晨，祭司长和长老、文士、全公会的人大家商议，就把耶稣捆绑，解去交给彼拉多。
{Mar 15:2}  And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him, "You have said so."
{Mar 15:2}  彼拉多问他说：“你是犹太人的王吗？”耶稣回答说：“你说的是。”
{Mar 15:3}  And the chief priests accused /a'kUs/[控告] him of many things.
{Mar 15:3}  祭司长告他许多的事。
{Mar 15:4}  And Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you."
{Mar 15:4}  彼拉多又问他说：“你看，他们告你这么多的事，你什么都不回答吗？”
{Mar 15:5}  But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.
{Mar 15:5}  耶稣仍不回答，以致彼拉多觉得希奇。
{Mar 15:6}  Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner /prizcn/[监狱] for whom they asked.
{Mar 15:6}  每逢这节期，巡抚照众人所求的，释放一个囚犯给他们。
{Mar 15:7}  And among the rebels /rebel/[造反] in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, /inscr'rekSCn/[作乱] there was a man called Barabbas.
{Mar 15:7}  有一个人名叫巴拉巴，和作乱的人一同捆绑。他们做乱的时候，曾杀过人。
{Mar 15:8}  And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them.
{Mar 15:8}  众人上去求巡抚，照常例给他们办。
{Mar 15:9}  And he answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"
{Mar 15:9}  彼拉多说：“你们要我释放犹太人的王给你们吗？”
{Mar 15:10} For he perceived that it was out of envy /envy/ that the chief priests had delivered him up.
{Mar 15:10} 他原晓得，祭司长是因为嫉妒才把耶稣解了来。
{Mar 15:11} But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. /in'sted/[替代]
{Mar 15:11} 只是祭司长挑唆众人，宁可释放巴拉巴给他们。
{Mar 15:12} And Pilate again said to them, "Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?"
{Mar 15:12} 彼拉多又说：“那么样，你们所称为犹太人的王，我怎么办他呢？”
{Mar 15:13} And they cried out again, "Crucify him."
{Mar 15:13} 他们又喊着说：“把他钉十字架！”
{Mar 15:14} And Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him."
{Mar 15:14} 彼拉多说：“为什么呢？他做了什么恶事呢？”他们便极力的喊着说：“把他钉十字架！”
{Mar 15:15} So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged /skcrdZ/[鞭打] Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
{Mar 15:15} 彼拉多要叫众人喜悦，就释放巴拉巴给他们，将耶稣鞭打了，交给人钉十字架。
{Mar 15:16} And the soldiers led him away inside the palace /pxlAs/[豪华住宅] (that is, the governor's headquarters), [总部 司令部 < 头部分] and they called together the whole battalion. /ba'txliCn/[军营]
{Mar 15:16} 兵丁把耶稣带进衙门院里，叫齐了全营的兵。
{Mar 15:17} And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting [扭] together a crown /kraun/[王冠] of thorns, they put it on him.
{Mar 15:17} 他们给他穿上紫袍，又用荆棘编做冠冕给他戴上，
{Mar 15:18} And they began to salute /sa'lut/[敬礼] him, "Hail, /hAl/[欢呼] King of the Jews!"
{Mar 15:18} 就庆贺他说：“恭喜，犹太人的王啊！”
{Mar 15:19} And they were striking his head with a reed /rEd/[芦苇] and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage /homAdZ/[尊崇] to him.
{Mar 15:19} 又拿一根苇子打他的头，吐唾沫在他脸上，屈膝拜他。
{Mar 15:20} And when they had mocked him, they stripped /strip/[脱] him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes /klOdhz/[衣服] on him. And they led him out to crucify him.
{Mar 15:20} 戏弄完了，就给他脱了紫袍，仍穿上他自己的衣服，带他出去，要钉十字架。
{Mar 15:21} And they compelled /kCm'pel/[强迫 < 强推] a passerby, /pxsscr'bI/[过路者 < 经过者] Simon of Cyrene, /sI'rEnE/ who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
{Mar 15:21} 有一个古利奈人西门，就是亚力山大和鲁孚的父亲，从乡下来，经过那地方，他们就勉强他同去，好背着耶稣的十字架。
{Mar 15:22} And they brought him to the place called Golgotha /golgctha/ (which means Place of a Skull). /skCl/
{Mar 15:22} 他们带耶稣到了各各他地方（各各他翻出来就是髑髅地），
{Mar 15:23} And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
{Mar 15:23} 拿没药调和的酒给耶稣，他却不受。
{Mar 15:24} And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.
{Mar 15:24} 于是将他钉在十字架上，拈阄分他的衣服，看是谁得什么。
{Mar 15:25} And it was the third hour when they crucified him.
{Mar 15:25} 钉他在十字架上是巳初的时候。
{Mar 15:26} And the inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews."
{Mar 15:26} 在上面有他的罪状，写的是：“犹太人的王。”
{Mar 15:27} And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.
{Mar 15:27} 他们又把两个强盗和他同钉十字架，一个在右边，一个在左边。（有古卷在此有
{Mar 15:28} And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “He was numbered with the transgressors”.
{Mar 15:28} “这就应了经上的话说：‘他被列在罪犯之中’。”）
{Mar 15:29} And those who passed by derided /dE'rId/[嘲弄] him, wagging /wxg/[摇摆] their heads and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild /rE'bild/[重建] it in three days,
{Mar 15:29} 从那里经过的人辱骂他，摇着头说：“咳！你这拆毁圣殿、三日又建造起来的，
{Mar 15:30} save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
{Mar 15:30} 可以救自己，从十字架上下来吧！”
{Mar 15:31} So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself.
{Mar 15:31} 祭司长和文士也是这样戏弄他，彼此说：“他救了别人，不能救自己。
{Mar 15:32} Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe." Those who were crucified with him also reviled /rE'vIl/[辱骂] him.
{Mar 15:32} 以色列的王基督，现在可以从十字架上下来，叫我们看见，就信了。”那和他同钉的人也是讥诮他。
{Mar 15:33} And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
{Mar 15:33} 从午正到申初，遍地都黑暗了。
{Mar 15:34} And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken /for'sAk/[抛弃] me?"
{Mar 15:34} 申初的时候，耶稣大声喊着说：“以罗伊！以罗伊！拉马撒巴各大尼？”（翻出来就是：我的神！我的神！为什么离弃我？）
{Mar 15:35} And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah."
{Mar 15:35} 旁边站着的人，有的听见就说：“看哪，他叫以利亚呢！”
{Mar 15:36} And someone ran and filled a sponge /spcndZ/[海绵] with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down."
{Mar 15:36} 有一个人跑去，把海绒蘸满了醋，绑在苇子上，送给他喝，说：“且等着，看以利亚来不来把他取下。”
{Mar 15:37} And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed /brEdh/[呼吸] his last.
{Mar 15:37} 耶稣大声喊叫，气就断了。
{Mar 15:38} And the curtain /kcrtan/[幕帐] of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. /botCm/

{Mar 16:15} 他又对他们说：“你们往普天下去，传福音给万民（万民：原文作凡受造的）听。
{Mar 16:16} Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
