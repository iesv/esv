{Mat 1:12}  And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, /SExl,tEl/ and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, /zerubabel/

{Mat 1:13}  and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, /a'bICd/ and Abiud the father of Eliakim, /E'lIakim/ and Eliakim the father of Azor, /Azor/

{Mat 1:16}  雅各生约瑟，就是马利亚的丈夫。那称为基督的耶稣是从马利亚生的。
{Mat 1:17}  So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.
{Mat 1:17}  这样，从亚伯拉罕到大卫共有十四代；从大卫到迁至巴比伦的时候也有十四代；从迁至巴比伦的时候到基督又有十四代。
{Mat 1:18}  Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place [发生、举行 < 拿到地方要办什么事] in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed /bE'trOdh/ to Joseph, before they came together she was found [发现] to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
{Mat 1:18}  耶稣基督降生的事记在下面：他母亲马利亚已经许配了约瑟，还没有迎娶，马利亚就从圣灵怀了孕。
{Mat 1:19}  And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling [adj.] to put her to shame, resolved /rE'zolv/[决定] to divorce /di'vors/ her quietly. /kwIet/[安静]
{Mat 1:19}  他丈夫约瑟是个义人，不愿意明明的羞辱他，想要暗暗的把他休了。
{Mat 1:20}  But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your /Ur/ wife, for that which is conceived [孕育、构思] in her is from the Holy Spirit.
{Mat 1:20}  正思念这事的时候，有主的使者向他梦中显现，说：“大卫的子孙约瑟，不要怕！只管娶过你的妻子马利亚来，因他所怀的孕是从圣灵来的。
{Mat 1:21}  She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
{Mat 1:21}  他将要生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫耶稣，因他要将自己的百姓从罪恶里救出来。”
{Mat 1:22}  All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
{Mat 1:22}  这一切的事成就是要应验主藉先知所说的话，
{Mat 1:23}  "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel" (which means, God with us).
{Mat 1:23}  说：“必有童女怀孕生子；人要称他的名为以马内利。”（以马内利翻出来就是“神与我们同在”。）
{Mat 1:24}  When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife,
{Mat 1:24}  约瑟醒了，起来，就遵着主使者的吩咐把妻子娶过来；
{Mat 1:25}  but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.
{Mat 1:25}  只是没有和他同房，等他生了儿子（有古卷：等他生了头胎的儿子），就给他起名叫耶稣。
{Mat 2:1}   Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,
{Mat 2:1}   当希律王的时候，耶稣生在犹太的伯利恒。有几个博士从东方来到耶路撒冷，说：
{Mat 2:2}   saying, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him."
{Mat 2:2}   “那生下来作犹太人之王的在那里？我们在东方看见他的星，特来拜他。”
{Mat 2:3}   When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;
{Mat 2:3}   希律王听见了，就心里不安；耶路撒冷合城的人也都不安。
{Mat 2:4}   and assembling /a'sembl/[集合、聚集 < 使成一起] [assembly language: 汇编语言] all the chief priests [祭司长] and scribes [文士、书记、抄写员] of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
{Mat 2:4}   他就召齐了祭司长和民间的文士，问他们说：“基督当生在何处？”
{Mat 2:5}   They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, [犹大地] for so it is written by the prophet:
{Mat 2:5}   他们回答说：“在犹太的伯利恒。因为有先知记着，说：
{Mat 2:6}   "'And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, [犹大] are by no means [phr.adv. 决不 < 没有一点这个意思] least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"
* by no means
I am by no means interested in the work.
我对这件工作一点也不感兴趣。
He will by no means lend you the money.
他决不会把钱借给你的。
*
{Mat 2:6}   犹大地的伯利恒啊，你在犹大诸城中并不是最小的；因为将来有一位君王要从你那里出来，牧养我以色列民。”
{Mat 2:7}   Then Herod summoned /sCmcn/[召集、召唤] the wise men secretly [秘密地] and ascertained /xscr'tAn/[v. 使之确定] from them what time the star had appeared. /a'pEr/[出现、显露 < 成为可见]
{Mat 2:7}   当下，希律暗暗的召了博士来，细问那星是什么时候出现的，
{Mat 2:8}   And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently /dilidZent/[勤备] for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him."
{Mat 2:8}   就差他们往伯利恒去，说：“你们去仔细寻访那小孩子，寻到了，就来报信，我也好去拜他。”
{Mat 2:9}   After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.
{Mat 2:9}   他们听见王的话就去了。在东方所看见的那星忽然在他们前头行，直行到小孩子的地方，就在上头停住了。
{Mat 2:10}  When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly /ek'sEd/[超出、极度] with great joy.
{Mat 2:10}  他们看见那星，就大大的欢喜；
{Mat 2:11}  And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense /frxnkinsens/[乳香] and myrrh. /mcr/[没药]
{Mat 2:11}  进了房子，看见小孩子和他母亲马利亚，就俯伏拜那小孩子，揭开宝盒，拿黄金、乳香、没药为礼物献给他。
{Mat 2:12}  And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed [离去、出发] to their own country by another way.
{Mat 2:12}  博士因为在梦中被主指示不要回去见希律，就从别的路回本地去了。
{Mat 2:13}  Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, /EdZipt/ and remain /rE'mAn/[留下] there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him."
{Mat 2:13}  他们去后，有主的使者向约瑟梦中显现，说：“起来！带着小孩子同他母亲逃往埃及，住在那里，等我吩咐你；因为希律必寻找小孩子，要除灭他。”
{Mat 2:14}  And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt
{Mat 2:14}  约瑟就起来，夜间带着小孩子和他母亲往埃及去，
{Mat 2:15}  and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son."
{Mat 2:15}  住在那里，直到希律死了。这是要应验主藉先知所说的话，说：“我从埃及召出我的儿子来。”
{Mat 2:16}  Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked /trik/[欺骗] by the wise men, became furious, /fUrics/[狂怒] and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.
{Mat 2:16}  希律见自己被博士愚弄，就大大发怒，差人将伯利恒城里并四境所有的男孩，照着他向博士仔细查问的时候，凡两岁以里的，都杀尽了。
{Mat 2:17}  Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
{Mat 2:17}  这就应了先知耶利米的话，说：
{Mat 2:18}  "A voice was heard in Ramah, /rama/ weeping and loud lamentation, /lxmen'tASCn/[哀悼] Rachel /rAtSel/ weeping for her children; she refused /rE'fUs/[拒绝] to be comforted, /komfcrt/[安慰] because they are no more."
{Mat 2:18}  在拉玛听见号啕大哭的声音，是拉结哭他儿女，不肯受安慰，因为他们都不在了。
{Mat 2:19}  But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
{Mat 2:19}  希律死了以后，有主的使者在埃及向约瑟梦中显现，说：
{Mat 2:20}  saying, "Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
{Mat 2:20}  “起来！带着小孩子和他母亲往以色列地去，因为要害小孩子性命的人已经死了。”
{Mat 2:21}  And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
{Mat 2:21}  约瑟就起来，把小孩子和他母亲带到以色列地去；
{Mat 2:22}  But when he heard that Archelaus /arkElACs/ was reigning over Judea in place of [phr.prep. 替代 < 代替位置或空缺] his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew [撤回] to the district /di'strikt/[区域] of Galilee.
{Mat 2:22}  只因听见亚基老接着他父亲希律作了犹太王，就怕往那里去，又在梦中被主指示，便往加利利境内去了，
{Mat 2:23}  And he went and lived /liv/ in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene. /nxzarEn/
{Mat 2:23}  到了一座城，名叫拿撒勒，就住在那里。这是要应验先知所说，他将称为拿撒勒人的话了。
{Mat 3:1}   In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
{Mat 3:1}   那时，有施洗的约翰出来，在犹太的旷野传道，说：
{Mat 3:2}   "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." [在手边、在附近、即将到来]
{Mat 3:2}   “天国近了，你们应当悔改！”
{Mat 3:3}   For this is he who was spoken of [phr.v. 论到] by the prophet Isaiah when he said, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.'"
{Mat 3:3}   这人就是先知以赛亚所说的。他说：“在旷野有人声喊着说：预备主的道，修直他的路！”
{Mat 3:4}   Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
{Mat 3:4}   这约翰身穿骆驼毛的衣服，腰束皮带，吃的是蝗虫、野蜜。
{Mat 3:5}   Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him,
{Mat 3:5}   那时，耶路撒冷和犹太全地，并约但河一带地方的人，都出去到约翰那里，

{Mat 3:16}  And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;
{Mat 3:16}  耶稣受了洗，随即从水里上来。天忽然为他开了，他就看见神的灵彷佛鸽子降下，落在他身上。
{Mat 3:17}  and behold, a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
{Mat 3:17}  从天上有声音说：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。”
{Mat 4:1}   Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
{Mat 4:1}   当时，耶稣被圣灵引到旷野，受魔鬼的试探。
{Mat 4:2}   And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
{Mat 4:2}   他禁食四十昼夜，后来就饿了。
{Mat 4:3}   And the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread." [多条面包]
{Mat 4:3}   那试探人的进前来，对他说：“你若是神的儿子，可以吩咐这些石头变成食物。”
{Mat 4:4}   But he answered, "It is written, "'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
{Mat 4:4}   耶稣却回答说：“经上记着说：人活着，不是单靠食物，乃是靠神口里所出的一切话。”
{Mat 4:5}   Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle [尖高峰] of the temple
{Mat 4:5}   魔鬼就带他进了圣城，叫他站在殿顶（顶原文作翅）上，
{Mat 4:6}   and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, "'He will command his angels concerning /kCn'scrn/[关系到] you,' and "'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike /strIk/[打] your foot against a stone.'"
{Mat 4:6}   对他说：“你若是神的儿子，可以跳下去，因为经上记着：主要为你吩咐他的使者用手托着你，免得你的脚碰在石头上。”
{Mat 4:7}   Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
{Mat 4:7}   耶稣对他说：“经上又记着说：‘不可试探主你的神。’”
{Mat 4:8}   Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
{Mat 4:8}   魔鬼又带他上了一座最高的山，将世上的万国与万国的荣华都指给他看，
{Mat 4:9}   And he said to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."
{Mat 4:9}   对他说：“你若俯伏拜我，我就把这一切都赐给你。”
{Mat 4:10}  Then Jesus said to him, "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, "'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"
{Mat 4:10}  耶稣说：“撒但（撒但就是抵挡的意思，乃魔鬼的别名），退去吧！因为经上记着说：当拜主你的神，单要事奉他。”
{Mat 4:11}  Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.

{Mat 4:13}  And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum /ka'pcrnACm/ by the sea, in the territory /teritcry/[领土] of Zebulun /zebUlCn/ and Naphtali, /nxftalI/
{Mat 4:13}  后又离开拿撒勒，往迦百农去，就住在那里。那地方靠海，在西布伦和拿弗他利的边界上。
{Mat 4:14}  so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
{Mat 4:14}  这是要应验先知以赛亚的话，
{Mat 4:15}  "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—
{Mat 4:15}  说：西布伦地，拿弗他利地，就是沿海的路，约但河外，外邦人的加利利地，
{Mat 4:16}  the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned." /don/[黎明]
{Mat 4:16}  那坐在黑暗里的百姓看见了大光；坐在死荫之地的人有光发现照着他们。
{Mat 4:17}  From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
{Mat 4:17}  从那时候，耶稣就传起道来，说：“天国近了，你们应当悔改！”
{Mat 4:18}  While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
{Mat 4:18}  耶稣在加利利海边行走，看见弟兄二人，就是那称呼彼得的西门和他兄弟安得烈，在海里撒网；他们本是打鱼的。
{Mat 4:19}  And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
{Mat 4:19}  耶稣对他们说：“来跟从我，我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。”
{Mat 4:20}  Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
{Mat 4:20}  他们就立刻舍了网，跟从了他。
{Mat 4:21}  And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending [修补] their nets, and he called them.
{Mat 4:21}  从那里往前走，又看见弟兄二人，就是西庇太的儿子雅各和他兄弟约翰，同他们的父亲西庇太在船上补网，耶稣就招呼他们，
{Mat 4:22}  Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
{Mat 4:22}  他们立刻舍了船，别了父亲，跟从了耶稣。
{Mat 4:23}  And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming [宣告] the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease [疾病] and every affliction /a'flikSCn/[苦难] among the people.
{Mat 4:23}  耶稣走遍加利利，在各会堂里教训人，传天国的福音，医治百姓各样的病症。
{Mat 4:24}  So his fame /fAm/[名声] spread /spred/[传播] throughout all Syria, /siria/ and they brought [带给] him all the sick, those afflicted with various /vxrics/[各种不同的] diseases and pains, /pAn/[痛苦] those oppressed /C'pres/[压制] by demons, those having seizures, /sEZcr/ and paralytics, /pxra'litik/[中风症] and he healed them.
{Mat 4:24}  他的名声就传遍了叙利亚。那里的人把一切害病的，就是害各样疾病、各样疼痛的和被鬼附的、癫痫的、瘫痪的，都带了来，耶稣就治好了他们。
{Mat 4:25}  And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, /dE'kxpclis/ and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
{Mat 4:25}  当下，有许多人从加利利、低加波利、耶路撒冷、犹太、约但河外来跟着他。
{Mat 5:1}   Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
{Mat 5:1}   耶稣看见这许多的人，就上了山，既已坐下，门徒到他跟前来，
{Mat 5:2}   And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying: [冒号引申；右引号放在语句的完全结束处]
{Mat 5:2}   他就开口教训他们，说：
{Mat 5:3}   "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

{Mat 5:12}  Rejoice and be glad, for your reward /rE'ward/[奖赏] is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
{Mat 5:12}  应当欢喜快乐，因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的。在你们以前的先知，人也是这样逼迫他们。”
{Mat 5:13}  "You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? /rE'stor/[恢复] It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled /trxmpl/[践踏] under people's feet.
{Mat 5:13}  “你们是世上的盐。盐若失了味，怎能叫他再咸呢？以后无用，不过丢在外面，被人践踏了。
{Mat 5:14}  "You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
{Mat 5:14}  你们是世上的光。城造在山上是不能隐藏的。
{Mat 5:15}  Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.
{Mat 5:15}  人点灯，不放在斗底下，是放在灯台上，就照亮一家的人。
{Mat 5:16}  In the same way, [phr.prep. 同样地] let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
{Mat 5:16}  你们的光也当这样照在人前，叫他们看见你们的好行为，便将荣耀归给你们在天上的父。”
{Mat 5:17}  "Do not think that I have come to abolish /a'boliS/[废除] the Law [大写表示上帝的律法] or the Prophets; [大写表示先知的教训] I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
{Mat 5:17}  “莫想我来要废掉律法和先知。我来不是要废掉，乃是要成全。
{Mat 5:18}  For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, [phr.v. 消逝] not an iota, /I'Ota/[极微小] not a dot, [小圆点] will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. /a'kCmpliS/[实现]
{Mat 5:18}  我实在告诉你们，就是到天地都废去了，律法的一点一画也不能废去，都要成全。
{Mat 5:19}  Therefore whoever relaxes /rE'lxks/[放松] one of the least [最小] of these commandments [戒律 < 多命令] and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
{Mat 5:19}  所以，无论何人废掉这诫命中最小的一条，又教训人这样做，他在天国要称为最小的。但无论何人遵行这诫命，又教训人遵行，他在天国要称为大的。
{Mat 5:20}  For I tell you, unless [un否定 less较少 > 不能少 > 若不] your righteousness exceeds /ek'sEd/[超过] that of the scribes and Pharisees, [专有名词] you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
{Mat 5:20}  我告诉你们，你们的义若不胜于文士和法利赛人的义，断不能进天国。”
{Mat 5:21}  "You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable /lIabl/[有责任的] to judgment.'
{Mat 5:21}  “你们听见有吩咐古人的话，说：‘不可杀人’；又说：‘凡杀人的难免受审判。’
{Mat 5:22}  But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults /in'sclt/[侮辱] his brother will be liable to the council; /kaunsil/[议会] and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire.
{Mat 5:22}  只是我告诉你们：凡（有古卷在凡字下加：无缘无故地）向弟兄动怒的，难免受审判；凡骂弟兄是拉加的，难免公会的审断；凡骂弟兄是魔利的，难免地狱的火。
{Mat 5:23}  So if you are offering your gift at the altar /altar/[祭坛] and there remember that your brother has something against you,
{Mat 5:23}  所以，你在祭坛上献礼物的时候，若想起弟兄向你怀怨，
{Mat 5:24}  leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled /rekcnsIl/[和好] to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
{Mat 5:24}  就把礼物留在坛前，先去同弟兄和好，然后来献礼物。
{Mat 5:25}  Come to terms [phr.v. 达成协议] quickly with your accuser /a'kUzcr/[控告者] while you are going with him to court, /kort/[法院] lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. [监狱]
{Mat 5:25}  你同告你的对头还在路上，就赶紧与他和息，恐怕他把你送给审判官，审判官交付衙役，你就下在监里了。
{Mat 5:26}  Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny. [一美分硬币]
{Mat 5:26}  我实在告诉你，若有一文钱没有还清，你断不能从那里出来。”
{Mat 5:27}  "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
{Mat 5:27}  “你们听见有话说：‘不可奸淫。’
{Mat 5:28}  But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful /lcstful/[好色的] intent /in'tent/[意图] has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
{Mat 5:28}  只是我告诉你们，凡看见妇女就动淫念的，这人心里已经与他犯奸淫了。
{Mat 5:29}  If your right eye causes [导致] you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members [成员] than that your whole body be thrown into hell.
{Mat 5:29}  若是你的右眼叫你跌倒，就剜出来丢掉，宁可失去百体中的一体，不叫全身丢在地狱里。
{Mat 5:30}  And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.
{Mat 5:30}  若是右手叫你跌倒，就砍下来丢掉，宁可失去百体中的一体，不叫全身下入地狱。”
{Mat 5:31}  "It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate /scr'tifikAt/[证书] of divorce.'  /di'vors/
{Mat 5:31}  “又有话说：‘人若休妻，就当给他休书。’
{Mat 5:32}  But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual /sekSUal/[性的] immorality, [淫荡] makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
{Mat 5:32}  只是我告诉你们，凡休妻的，若不是为淫乱的缘故，就是叫他作淫妇了；人若娶这被休的妇人，也是犯奸淫了。”
{Mat 5:33}  "Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear /swAr/[起誓] falsely, but shall perform /pcr'form/[履行] to the Lord what you have sworn.'
{Mat 5:33}  “你们又听见有吩咐古人的话，说：‘不可背誓，所起的誓总要向主谨守。’
{Mat 5:34}  But I say to you, Do not take an oath /Oth/[誓言] at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne /thrOn/[王位] of God,
{Mat 5:34}  只是我告诉你们，什么誓都不可起。不可指着天起誓，因为天是神的座位；
{Mat 5:35}  or by the earth, for it is his footstool, /fwt,stwl/ or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
{Mat 5:35}  不可指着地起誓，因为地是他的脚凳；也不可指着耶路撒冷起誓，因为耶路撒冷是大君的京城；
{Mat 5:36}  And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
{Mat 5:36}  又不可指着你的头起誓，因为你不能使一根头发变黑变白了。
{Mat 5:37}  Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from evil.
{Mat 5:37}  你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是；若再多说，就是出于那恶者（或作就是从恶里出来的）。”
{Mat 5:38}  "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'
{Mat 5:38}  “你们听见有话说：‘以眼还眼，以牙还牙。’

{Mat 5:39}  只是我告诉你们，不要与恶人作对。有人打你的右脸，连左脸也转过来由他打；
{Mat 5:40}  And if anyone would sue /su/[诉讼] you and take your tunic, [束腰外衣] let him have your cloak [斗篷] as well.
{Mat 5:40}  有人想要告你，要拿你的里衣，连外衣也由他拿去；
{Mat 5:41}  And if anyone forces /fors/[强迫] you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
{Mat 5:41}  有人强逼你走一里路，你就同他走二里；
{Mat 5:42}  Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow /borO/[借入] from you.
{Mat 5:42}  有求你的，就给他；有向你借贷的，不可推辞。”

{Mat 5:44}  But I say to you, Love [句首大写] your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
{Mat 5:44}  只是我告诉你们，要爱你们的仇敌，为那逼迫你们的祷告。
{Mat 5:45}  so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
{Mat 5:45}  这样就可以作你们天父的儿子；因为他叫日头照好人，也照歹人；降雨给义人，也给不义的人。
{Mat 5:46}  For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
{Mat 5:46}  你们若单爱那爱你们的人，有什么赏赐呢？就是税吏不也是这样行吗？
{Mat 5:47}  And if you greet [致敬] only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
{Mat 5:47}  你们若单请你弟兄的安，比人有什么长处呢？就是外邦人不也是这样行吗？
{Mat 5:48}  You therefore must be perfect, /pcrfekt/[完美] as your heavenly Father is perfect.
{Mat 5:48}  所以，你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样。”
{Mat 6:1}   "Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
{Mat 6:1}   “你们要小心，不可将善事行在人的面前，故意叫他们看见，若是这样，就不能得你们天父的赏赐了。
{Mat 6:2}   "Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet /trCmpet/[喇叭] before you, as the hypocrites /hipOkrit/[伪君子] do in the synagogues [犹太教会堂] and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
{Mat 6:2}   所以，你施舍的时候，不可在你前面吹号，像那假冒为善的人在会堂里和街道上所行的，故意要得人的荣耀。我实在告诉你们，他们已经得了他们的赏赐。
{Mat 6:3}   But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
{Mat 6:3}   你施舍的时候，不要叫左手知道右手所做的，
{Mat 6:4}   so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
{Mat 6:4}   要叫你施舍的事行在暗中。你父在暗中察看，必然报答你（有古卷：必在明处报答你）。”
{Mat 6:5}   "And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

{Mat 6:9}   Pray then like this: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed /hxllO/[神圣 < holy] be your name.
{Mat 6:9}   所以，你们祷告要这样说：我们在天上的父：愿人都尊你的名为圣。

{Mat 6:11}  我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们。

{Mat 6:12}  免我们的债，如同我们免了人的债。

{Mat 6:13}  不叫我们遇见试探；救我们脱离凶恶（或作：脱离恶者）。因为国度、权柄、荣耀，全是你的，直到永远。阿们（有古卷没有因为至阿们等字）！’
{Mat 6:14}  For if you forgive others their trespasses, /trespas/[过犯 < 侵入] your heavenly Father will also forgive you,
{Mat 6:14}  你们饶恕人的过犯，你们的天父也必饶恕你们的过犯；
{Mat 6:15}  but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
{Mat 6:15}  你们不饶恕人的过犯，你们的天父也必不饶恕你们的过犯。”
{Mat 6:16}  "And when you fast, do not look gloomy /glwmy/[忧闷] like the hypocrites, for they disfigure /dis'figUr/[弄丑] their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

{Mat 6:17}  But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
{Mat 6:17}  你禁食的时候，要梳头洗脸，
{Mat 6:18}  that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

{Mat 6:25}  "Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious /ankScs/[忧虑] about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
{Mat 6:25}  “所以我告诉你们，不要为生命忧虑吃什么，喝什么；为身体忧虑穿什么。生命不胜于饮食吗？身体不胜于衣裳吗？

{Mat 6:26}  你们看那天上的飞鸟，也不种，也不收，也不积蓄在仓里，你们的天父尚且养活他。你们不比飞鸟贵重得多吗？
{Mat 6:27}  And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span /spxn/[一手掌距离] of life?
{Mat 6:27}  你们那一个能用思虑使寿数多加一刻呢（或作：使身量多加一肘呢）？
{Mat 6:28}  And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider [细想] the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil [劳苦] nor spin, [纺织]
{Mat 6:28}  何必为衣裳忧虑呢？你想野地里的百合花怎么长起来；他也不劳苦，也不纺线。
{Mat 6:29}  yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed /ar'rA/[盛装] like one of these.
{Mat 6:29}  然而我告诉你们，就是所罗门极荣华的时候，他所穿戴的，还不如这花一朵呢！
{Mat 6:30}  But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, /cven/[炉灶] will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
{Mat 6:30}  你们这小信的人哪！野地里的草今天还在，明天就丢在炉里，神还给他这样的妆饰，何况你们呢！

{Mat 7:9}   你们中间谁有儿子求饼，反给他石头呢？
{Mat 7:10}  Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?
{Mat 7:10}  求鱼，反给他蛇呢？
{Mat 7:11}  If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
{Mat 7:11}  你们虽然不好，尚且知道拿好东西给儿女，何况你们在天上的父，岂不更把好东西给求他的人吗？
{Mat 7:12}  "So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.

{Mat 7:23}  And then will I declare [宣告] to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'
{Mat 7:23}  我就明明的告诉他们说：‘我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！’”
{Mat 7:24}  "Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
{Mat 7:24}  “所以，凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人，把房子盖在磐石上；
{Mat 7:25}  And the rain fell, and the floods /flcd/[洪水] came, and the winds blew /blw/ and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.
{Mat 7:25}  雨淋，水冲，风吹，撞着那房子，房子总不倒塌，因为根基立在磐石上。
{Mat 7:26}  And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. /sxnd/[沙子]
{Mat 7:26}  凡听见我这话不去行的，好比一个无知的人，把房子盖在沙土上；
{Mat 7:27}  And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it."
{Mat 7:27}  雨淋，水冲，风吹，撞着那房子，房子就倒塌了，并且倒塌得很大。”
{Mat 7:28}  And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished [惊讶] at his teaching,
{Mat 7:28}  耶稣讲完了这些话，众人都希奇他的教训；
{Mat 7:29}  for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
{Mat 7:29}  因为他教训他们，正像有权柄的人，不像他们的文士。
{Mat 8:1}   When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
{Mat 8:1}   耶稣下了山，有许多人跟着他。
{Mat 8:2}   And behold, a leper [麻风病人] came to him and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."
{Mat 8:2}   有一个长大麻疯的来拜他，说：“主若肯，必能叫我洁净了。”
{Mat 8:3}   And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." And immediately his leprosy /leprcsy/[麻风病] was cleansed.
{Mat 8:3}   耶稣伸手摸他，说：“我肯，你洁净了吧！”他的大麻疯立刻就洁净了。
{Mat 8:4}   And Jesus said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, [此处省略and] show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof [证据] to them."
{Mat 8:4}   耶稣对他说：“你切不可告诉人，只要去把身体给祭司察看，献上摩西所吩咐的礼物，对众人作证据。”
{Mat 8:5}   When he had entered Capernaum, a centurion /sen'tSUricn/[百夫长] came forward [向前] to him, appealing /a'pEl/[恳求] to him,
{Mat 8:5}   耶稣进了迦百农，有一个百夫长进前来，求他说：
{Mat 8:6}   "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed /pxra,lIz/[半身不遂] at home, suffering terribly." [可怕地、极度地]
{Mat 8:6}   “主啊，我的仆人害瘫痪病，躺在家里，甚是疼苦。”
{Mat 8:7}   And he said to him, "I will come and heal him."
{Mat 8:7}   耶稣说：“我去医治他。”
{Mat 8:8}   But the centurion replied, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.
{Mat 8:8}   百夫长回答说：“主啊，你到我舍下，我不敢当；只要你说一句话，我的仆人就必好了。
{Mat 8:9}   For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
{Mat 8:9}   因为我在人的权下，也有兵在我以下；对这个说：‘去！’他就去；对那个说：‘来！’他就来；对我的仆人说：‘你做这事！’他就去做。”
{Mat 8:10}  When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith.
{Mat 8:10}  耶稣听见就希奇，对跟从的人说：“我实在告诉你们，这么大的信心，就是在以色列中，我也没有遇见过。
{Mat 8:11}  I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,
{Mat 8:11}  我又告诉你们，从东从西，将有许多人来，在天国里与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各一同坐席；
{Mat 8:12}  while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing /nxS/[咬] of teeth."
{Mat 8:12}  惟有本国的子民竟被赶到外边黑暗里去，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。”
{Mat 8:13}  And to the centurion Jesus said, "Go; let it be done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed at that very moment.
{Mat 8:13}  耶稣对百夫长说：“你回去吧！照你的信心，给你成全了。”那时，他的仆人就好了。
{Mat 8:14}  And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
{Mat 8:14}  耶稣到了彼得家里，见彼得的岳母害热病躺着。
{Mat 8:15}  He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him.
{Mat 8:15}  耶稣把他的手一摸，热就退了；他就起来服事耶稣。
{Mat 8:16}  That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick.
{Mat 8:16}  到了晚上，有人带着许多被鬼附的来到耶稣跟前，他只用一句话就把鬼都赶出去，并且治好了一切有病的人。
{Mat 8:17}  This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: "He took our illnesses [疾病] and bore our diseases." [病害]
{Mat 8:17}  这是要应验先知以赛亚的话，说：他代替我们的软弱，担当我们的疾病。
{Mat 8:18}  Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side.
{Mat 8:18}  耶稣见许多人围着他，就吩咐渡到那边去。
{Mat 8:19}  And a scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
{Mat 8:19}  有一个文士来，对他说：“夫子，你无论往那里去，我要跟从你。”
{Mat 8:20}  And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
{Mat 8:20}  耶稣说：“狐狸有洞，天空的飞鸟有窝，人子却没有枕头的地方。”
{Mat 8:21}  Another of the disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
{Mat 8:21}  又有一个门徒对耶稣说：“主啊，容我先回去埋葬我的父亲。”
{Mat 8:22}  And Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."
{Mat 8:22}  耶稣说：“任凭死人埋葬他们的死人；你跟从我吧！”
{Mat 8:23}  And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
{Mat 8:23}  耶稣上了船，门徒跟着他。
{Mat 8:24}  And behold, there arose a great storm /storm/[暴风雨] on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped /swamp/[淹盖] by the waves; but he was asleep.
{Mat 8:24}  海里忽然起了暴风，甚至船被波浪掩盖；耶稣却睡着了。
{Mat 8:25}  And they went and woke him, saying, "Save us, Lord; we are perishing."
{Mat 8:25}  门徒来叫醒了他，说：“主啊，救我们，我们丧命啦！”
{Mat 8:26}  And he said to them, "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. /kam/[平静]
{Mat 8:26}  耶稣说：“你们这小信的人哪，为什么胆怯呢？”于是起来，斥责风和海，风和海就大大的平静了。
{Mat 8:27}  And the men marveled, saying, "What sort [种类] of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?"
{Mat 8:27}  众人希奇，说：“这是怎样的人？连风和海也听从他了！”
{Mat 8:28}  And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, /gxdar'rEns/ two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce /fErs/[凶猛] that no one could pass that way.
{Mat 8:28}  耶稣既渡到那边去，来到加大拉人的地方，就有两个被鬼附的人从坟茔里出来迎着他，极其凶猛，甚至没有人能从那条路上经过。
{Mat 8:29}  And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
{Mat 8:29}  他们喊着说：“神的儿子，我们与你有什么相干？时候还没有到，你就上这里来叫我们受苦吗？”
{Mat 8:30}  Now a herd /hcrd/[兽群] of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them.
{Mat 8:30}  离他们很远，有一大群猪吃食。
{Mat 8:31}  And the demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs."
{Mat 8:31}  鬼就央求耶稣，说：“若把我们赶出去，就打发我们进入猪群吧！”
{Mat 8:32}  And he said to them, "Go." So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed /rcS/[匆忙] down the steep /stEp/[陡峭 浸泡] bank into the sea and drowned /draun/[淹死] in the waters.
{Mat 8:32}  耶稣说：“去吧！”鬼就出来，进入猪群。全群忽然闯下山崖，投在海里淹死了。
{Mat 8:33}  The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, especially /es'peSally/[特别地] what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
{Mat 8:33}  放猪的就逃跑进城，将这一切事和被鬼附的人所遭遇的都告诉人。
{Mat 8:34}  And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
{Mat 8:34}  合城的人都出来迎见耶稣，既见了就央求他离开他们的境界。
{Mat 9:1}   And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city.
{Mat 9:1}   耶稣上了船，渡过海，来到自己的城里。
{Mat 9:2}   And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, /pxra'litik/[中风的、半残废] lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven."
{Mat 9:2}   有人用褥子抬着一个瘫子到耶稣跟前来。耶稣见他们的信心，就对瘫子说：“小子，放心吧！你的罪赦了。”
{Mat 9:3}   And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming."
{Mat 9:3}   有几个文士心里说：“这个人说僭妄的话了。”
{Mat 9:4}   But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
{Mat 9:4}   耶稣知道他们的心意，就说：“你们为什么心里怀着恶念呢？
{Mat 9:5}   For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?
{Mat 9:5}   或说：‘你的罪赦了’，或说：‘你起来行走’，那一样容易呢？
{Mat 9:6}   But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"—he then said to the paralytic—"Rise, pick up your bed and go home."
{Mat 9:6}   但要叫你们知道，人子在地上有赦罪的权柄”；就对瘫子说：“起来！拿你的褥子回家去吧。”
{Mat 9:7}   And he rose and went home.
{Mat 9:7}   那人就起来，回家去了。
{Mat 9:8}   When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
{Mat 9:8}   众人看见都惊奇，就归荣耀与神，因为他将这样的权柄赐给人。
{Mat 9:9}   As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, [小亭、货摊] and he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
{Mat 9:9}   耶稣从那里往前走，看见一个人名叫马太，坐在税关上，就对他说：“你跟从我来。”他就起来跟从了耶稣。
{Mat 9:10}  And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples.
{Mat 9:10}  耶稣在屋里坐席的时候，有好些税吏和罪人来，与耶稣和他的门徒一同坐席。
{Mat 9:11}  And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
{Mat 9:11}  法利赛人看见，就对耶稣的门徒说：“你们的先生为什么和税吏并罪人一同吃饭呢？”
{Mat 9:12}  But when he heard it, he said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
{Mat 9:12}  耶稣听见，就说：“康健的人用不着医生，有病的人才用得着。
{Mat 9:13}  Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."
{Mat 9:13}  经上说：‘我喜爱怜恤，不喜爱祭祀。’这句话的意思，你们且去揣摩。我来本不是召义人，乃是召罪人。”
{Mat 9:14}  Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
{Mat 9:14}  那时，约翰的门徒来见耶稣，说：“我们和法利赛人常常禁食，你的门徒倒不禁食，这是为什么呢？”
{Mat 9:15}  And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.
{Mat 9:15}  耶稣对他们说：“新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候，陪伴之人岂能哀恸呢？但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那时候他们就要禁食。
{Mat 9:16}  No one puts a piece of unshrunk /Cn'Srcnk/[不收缩] cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.
{Mat 9:16}  没有人把新布补在旧衣服上；因为所补上的反带坏了那衣服，破的就更大了。
{Mat 9:17}  Neither is new wine put into old wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled /spil/[溢出] and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved." /prE'zcrv/[保藏 < pre预先 serve=save保存 > 预先保存]
{Mat 9:17}  也没有人把新酒装在旧皮袋里；若是这样，皮袋就裂开，酒漏出来，连皮袋也坏了。惟独把新酒装在新皮袋里，两样就都保全了。”
{Mat 9:18}  While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
{Mat 9:18}  耶稣说这话的时候，有一个管会堂的来拜他，说：“我女儿刚才死了，求你去按手在他身上，他就必活了。”
{Mat 9:19}  And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples.
{Mat 9:19}  耶稣便起来跟着他去；门徒也跟了去。
{Mat 9:20}  And behold, a woman who had suffered from a discharge [卸出] of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment,
{Mat 9:20}  有一个女人，患了十二年的血漏，来到耶稣背后，摸他的衣裳䍁子；
{Mat 9:21}  for she said to herself, "If I only touch his garment, I will be made well."
{Mat 9:21}  因为他心里说：“我只摸他的衣裳，就必痊愈。”
{Mat 9:22}  Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And instantly /instantly/[立即] the woman was made well.
{Mat 9:22}  耶稣转过来，看见他，就说：“女儿，放心！你的信救了你。”从那时候，女人就痊愈了。
{Mat 9:23}  And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute /flut/[长笛] players and the crowd making a commotion, /kC'mOSCn/[骚动 < 一起动]
{Mat 9:23}  耶稣到了管会堂的家里，看见有吹手，又有许多人乱嚷，
{Mat 9:24}  he said, "Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping." And they laughed at him.
{Mat 9:24}  就说：“退去吧！这闺女不是死了，是睡着了。”他们就嗤笑他。
{Mat 9:25}  But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
{Mat 9:25}  众人既被撵出，耶稣就进去，拉着闺女的手，闺女便起来了。
{Mat 9:26}  And the report of this went through all that district.
{Mat 9:26}  于是这风声传遍了那地方。
{Mat 9:27}  And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, "Have mercy on us, Son of David."
{Mat 9:27}  耶稣从那里往前走，有两个瞎子跟着他，喊叫说：“大卫的子孙，可怜我们吧！”
{Mat 9:28}  When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."
{Mat 9:28}  耶稣进了房子，瞎子就来到他跟前。耶稣说：“你们信我能做这事吗？”他们说：“主啊，我们信。”
{Mat 9:29}  Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith be it done to you."
{Mat 9:29}  耶稣就摸他们的眼睛，说：“照着你们的信给你们成全了吧。”
{Mat 9:30}  And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly /stcrnly/[切切地] warned them, "See that no one knows about it."
{Mat 9:30}  他们的眼睛就开了。耶稣切切的嘱咐他们说：“你们要小心，不可叫人知道。”
{Mat 9:31}  But they went away and spread his fame through all that district.
{Mat 9:31}  他们出去，竟把他的名声传遍了那地方。
{Mat 9:32}  As they were going away, behold, a demon-oppressed man who was mute was brought to him.
{Mat 9:32}  他们出去的时候，有人将鬼所附的一个哑巴带到耶稣跟前来。
{Mat 9:33}  And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, "Never was anything like this seen in Israel."
{Mat 9:33}  鬼被赶出去，哑巴就说出话来。众人都希奇，说：“在以色列中，从来没有见过这样的事。”
{Mat 9:34}  But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons."
{Mat 9:34}  法利赛人却说：“他是靠着鬼王赶鬼。”
{Mat 9:35}  And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction.
{Mat 9:35}  耶稣走遍各城各乡，在会堂里教训人，宣讲天国的福音，又医治各样的病症。
{Mat 9:36}  When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed /ha'rxs/[困苦] and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
{Mat 9:36}  他看见许多的人，就怜悯他们；因为他们困苦流离，如同羊没有牧人一般。
{Mat 9:37}  Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest [收割] is plentiful, but the laborers are few;
{Mat 9:37}  于是对门徒说：“要收的庄稼多，做工的人少。
{Mat 9:38}  therefore pray earnestly /crnestly/[热心 诚挚] to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
{Mat 9:38}  所以，你们当求庄稼的主打发工人出去收他的庄稼。”
{Mat 10:1}  And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction.
{Mat 10:1}  耶稣叫了十二个门徒来，给他们权柄，能赶逐污鬼，并医治各样的病症。
{Mat 10:2}  The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
{Mat 10:2}  这十二使徒的名：头一个叫西门（又称彼得），还有他兄弟安得烈，西庇太的儿子雅各和雅各的兄弟约翰，

{Mat 10:3}  腓力和巴多罗买，多马和税吏马太，亚勒腓的儿子雅各，和达太，
{Mat 10:4}  Simon the Zealot, /zelct/[狂热者] and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
{Mat 10:4}  奋锐党的西门，还有卖耶稣的加略人犹大。
{Mat 10:5}  These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing /in'strCkt/[教导 < 堆积知识] them, "Go nowhere [无处] among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, /sa'mxritan/
{Mat 10:5}  耶稣差这十二个人去，吩咐他们说：“外邦人的路，你们不要走；撒玛利亚人的城，你们不要进；
{Mat 10:6}  but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
{Mat 10:6}  宁可往以色列家迷失的羊那里去。
{Mat 10:7}  And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
{Mat 10:7}  随走随传，说‘天国近了！’
{Mat 10:8}  Heal the sick, raise /rAs/[举起] the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay.
{Mat 10:8}  医治病人，叫死人复活，叫长大麻疯的洁净，把鬼赶出去。你们白白的得来，也要白白的舍去。
{Mat 10:9}  Acquire /a'kwIr/[取得] no gold or silver or copper for your belts,
{Mat 10:9}  腰袋里不要带金银铜钱。
{Mat 10:10} no bag for your journey, or two tunics or sandals or a staff, for the laborer deserves his food.
{Mat 10:10} 行路不要带口袋；不要带两件褂子，也不要带鞋和拐杖；因为工人得饮食是应当的。
{Mat 10:11} And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart.
{Mat 10:11} 你们无论进哪一城，哪一村，要打听那里谁是好人，就住在他家，直住到走的时候。
{Mat 10:12} As you enter the house, greet it.
{Mat 10:12} 进他家里去，要请他的安。
{Mat 10:13} And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
{Mat 10:13} 那家若配得平安，你们所求的平安就必临到那家；若不配得，你们所求的平安仍归你们。
{Mat 10:14} And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.
{Mat 10:14} 凡不接待你们、不听你们话的人，你们离开那家，或是那城的时候，就把脚上的尘土跺下去。
{Mat 10:15} Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable [可承受的] on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom /sodCm/[所多玛] and Gomorrah /gO'mora/[蛾摩拉] than for that town.
{Mat 10:15} 我实在告诉你们，当审判的日子，所多玛和蛾摩拉所受的，比那城还容易受呢！”
{Mat 10:16} "Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent /incsent/[天真、无知] as doves.
{Mat 10:16} “我差你们去，如同羊进入狼群；所以你们要灵巧像蛇，驯良像鸽子。
{Mat 10:17} Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues,
{Mat 10:17} 你们要防备人；因为他们要把你们交给公会，也要在会堂里鞭打你们，
{Mat 10:18} and you will be dragged /drxg/[拖拉] before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles.
{Mat 10:18} 并且你们要为我的缘故被送到诸侯君王面前，对他们和外邦人作见证。
{Mat 10:19} When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour.
{Mat 10:19} 你们被交的时候，不要思虑怎样说话，或说什么话。到那时候，必赐给你们当说的话；
{Mat 10:20} For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
{Mat 10:20} 因为不是你们自己说的，乃是你们父的灵在你们里头说的。
{Mat 10:21} Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death,
{Mat 10:21} 弟兄要把弟兄，父亲要把儿子，送到死地；儿女要与父母为敌，害死他们；
{Mat 10:22} and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures /en'dwr/[忍耐] to the end will be saved.
{Mat 10:22} 并且你们要为我的名被众人恨恶。惟有忍耐到底的必然得救。
{Mat 10:23} When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
{Mat 10:23} 有人在这城里逼迫你们，就逃到那城里去。我实在告诉你们，以色列的城邑，你们还没有走遍，人子就到了。
{Mat 10:24} "A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
{Mat 10:24} 学生不能高过先生；仆人不能高过主人。
{Mat 10:25} It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign /ma'lIn/[中伤] those of his household.
{Mat 10:25} 学生和先生一样，仆人和主人一样，也就罢了。人既骂家主是别西卜（别西卜：是鬼王的名），何况他的家人呢？”
{Mat 10:26} "So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.
{Mat 10:26} “所以，不要怕他们；因为掩盖的事没有不露出来的，隐藏的事没有不被人知道的。
{Mat 10:27} What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, /wispcr/[耳语] proclaim on the housetops.
{Mat 10:27} 我在暗中告诉你们的，你们要在明处说出来；你们耳中所听的，要在房上宣扬出来。
{Mat 10:28} And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
{Mat 10:28} 那杀身体，不能杀灵魂的，不要怕他们；惟有能把身体和灵魂都灭在地狱里的，正要怕他。
{Mat 10:29} Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
{Mat 10:29} 两个麻雀不是卖一分银子吗？若是你们的父不许，一个也不能掉在地上；
{Mat 10:30} But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
{Mat 10:30} 就是你们的头发也都被数过了。
{Mat 10:31} Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
{Mat 10:31} 所以，不要惧怕，你们比许多麻雀还贵重！”
{Mat 10:32} So everyone who acknowledges /ak'nolEdZ/[承认] me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven,
{Mat 10:32} “凡在人面前认我的，我在我天上的父面前也必认他；
{Mat 10:33} but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.
{Mat 10:33} 凡在人面前不认我的，我在我天上的父面前也必不认他。”
{Mat 10:34} "Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
{Mat 10:34} “你们不要想我来是叫地上太平；我来并不是叫地上太平，乃是叫地上动刀兵。
{Mat 10:35} For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
{Mat 10:35} 因为我来是叫人与父亲生疏，女儿与母亲生疏，媳妇与婆婆生疏。
{Mat 10:36} And a person's enemies will be those of his own household.
{Mat 10:36} 人的仇敌就是自己家里的人。
{Mat 10:37} Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
{Mat 10:37} “爱父母过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；爱儿女过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；
{Mat 10:38} And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
{Mat 10:38} 不背着他的十字架跟从我的，也不配作我的门徒。
{Mat 10:39} Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
{Mat 10:39} 得着生命的，将要失丧生命；为我失丧生命的，将要得着生命。”
{Mat 10:40} "Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.
{Mat 10:40} “人接待你们就是接待我；接待我就是接待那差我来的。
{Mat 10:41} The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward.
{Mat 10:41} 人因为先知的名接待先知，必得先知所得的赏赐；人因为义人的名接待义人，必得义人所得的赏赐。
{Mat 10:42} And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward."
{Mat 10:42} 无论何人，因为门徒的名，只把一杯凉水给这小子里的一个喝，我实在告诉你们，这人不能不得赏赐。”
{Mat 11:1}  When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.
{Mat 11:1}  耶稣吩咐完了十二个门徒，就离开那里，往各城去传道，教训人。
{Mat 11:2}  Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples
{Mat 11:2}  约翰在监里听见基督所做的事，就打发两个门徒去，
{Mat 11:3}  and said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?"
{Mat 11:3}  问他说：“那将要来的是你吗？还是我们等候别人呢？”
{Mat 11:4}  And Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see:
{Mat 11:4}  耶稣回答说：“你们去，把所听见，所看见的事告诉约翰。
{Mat 11:5}  the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.
{Mat 11:5}  就是瞎子看见，瘸子行走，长大麻疯的洁净，聋子听见，死人复活，穷人有福音传给他们。
{Mat 11:6}  And blessed is the one who is not offended /c'fend/[犯错误] by me."
{Mat 11:6}  凡不因我跌倒的就有福了！”
{Mat 11:7}  As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
{Mat 11:7}  他们走的时候，耶稣就对众人讲论约翰说：“你们从前出到旷野是要看什么呢？要看风吹动的芦苇吗？
{Mat 11:8}  What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
{Mat 11:8}  你们出去到底是要看什么？要看穿细软衣服的人吗？那穿细软衣服的人是在王宫里。
{Mat 11:9}  What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
{Mat 11:9}  你们出去究竟是为什么？是要看先知吗？我告诉你们，是的，他比先知大多了。
{Mat 11:10} This is he of whom it is written, "'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
{Mat 11:10} 经上记着说：‘我要差遣我的使者在你前面预备道路’，所说的就是这个人。
{Mat 11:11} Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
{Mat 11:11} 我实在告诉你们，凡妇人所生的，没有一个兴起来大过施洗约翰的；然而天国里最小的比他还大。
{Mat 11:12} From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered /scfcr/[遭受] violence, /vIOlens/[暴力] and the violent take it by force.
{Mat 11:12} 从施洗约翰的时候到如今，天国是努力进入的，努力的人就得着了。
{Mat 11:13} For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied /profesI/[预言] until John,
{Mat 11:13} 因为众先知和律法说预言，到约翰为止。
{Mat 11:14} and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.
{Mat 11:14} 你们若肯领受，这人就是那应当来的以利亚。
{Mat 11:15} He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
{Mat 11:15} 有耳可听的，就应当听！
{Mat 11:16} "But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates, /plAmAt/[玩伴]
{Mat 11:16} 我可用什么比这世代呢？好像孩童坐在街市上招呼同伴，说：
{Mat 11:17} "'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, /dcrdZ/[丧曲] and you did not mourn.'
{Mat 11:17} 我们向你们吹笛，你们不跳舞；我们向你们举哀，你们不捶胸。
{Mat 11:18} For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
{Mat 11:18} 约翰来了，也不吃也不喝，人就说他是被鬼附着的；
{Mat 11:19} The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton /glctcn/[贪吃者] and a drunkard, /drcnkard/[酒鬼] a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds."
{Mat 11:19} 人子来了，也吃也喝，人又说他是贪食好酒的人，是税吏和罪人的朋友。但智慧之子总以智慧为是（有古卷：但智慧在行为上就显为是）。”
{Mat 11:20} Then he began to denounce /dE'nauns/[谴责] the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.
{Mat 11:20} 耶稣在诸城中行了许多异能，那些城的人终不悔改，就在那时候责备他们，说：
{Mat 11:21} "Woe to you, Chorazin! /kOrAzin/ Woe to you, Bethsaida! /beth'sAida/ For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth /sxkloth/[粗麻布衣] and ashes. /xS/[灰]
{Mat 11:21} “哥拉汛哪，你有祸了！伯赛大啊，你有祸了！因为在你们中间所行的异能，若行在推罗、西顿，他们早已披麻蒙灰悔改了。
{Mat 11:22} But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
{Mat 11:22} 但我告诉你们，当审判的日子，推罗、西顿所受的，比你们还容易受呢！
{Mat 11:23} And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted /eg'zalt/[提升] to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. /hAdEs/[阴间] For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
{Mat 11:23} 迦百农啊，你已经升到天上（或作：你将要升到天上吗），将来必坠落阴间；因为在你那里所行的异能，若行在所多玛，他还可以存到今日。
{Mat 11:24} But I tell you that it will be more tolerable /tolcrabl/[可忍受的] on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you."
{Mat 11:24} 但我告诉你们，当审判的日子，所多玛所受的，比你还容易受呢！”
{Mat 11:25} At that time Jesus declared, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children;
{Mat 11:25} 那时，耶稣说：“父啊，天地的主，我感谢你！因为你将这些事向聪明通达人就藏起来，向婴孩就显出来。
{Mat 11:26} yes, Father, for such was your gracious /grAScs/[优雅的、高尚的、美善的] will.
{Mat 11:26} 父啊，是的，因为你的美意本是如此。
{Mat 11:27} All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
{Mat 11:27} 一切所有的，都是我父交付我的；除了父，没有人知道子；除了子和子所愿意指示的，没有人知道父。
{Mat 11:28} Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, /lAd/[装货] and I will give you rest.
{Mat 11:28} 凡劳苦担重担的人可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。
{Mat 11:29} Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle /dZentl/[温雅的] and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
{Mat 11:29} 我心里柔和谦卑，你们当负我的轭，学我的样式；这样，你们心里就必得享安息。
{Mat 11:30} For my yoke is easy, and my burden /bcrden/[负担] is light."
{Mat 11:30} 因为我的轭是容易的，我的担子是轻省的。”
{Mat 12:1}  At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
{Mat 12:1}  那时，耶稣在安息日从麦地经过。他的门徒饿了，就掐起麦穗来吃。
{Mat 12:2}  But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
{Mat 12:2}  法利赛人看见，就对耶稣说：“看哪，你的门徒做安息日不可做的事了！”
{Mat 12:3}  He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him:
{Mat 12:3}  耶稣对他们说：“经上记着大卫和跟从他的人饥饿之时所做的事，你们没有念过吗？
{Mat 12:4}  how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, /prezens/ which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?
{Mat 12:4}  他怎么进了神的殿，吃了陈设饼，这饼不是他和跟从他的人可以吃得，惟独祭司才可以吃。
{Mat 12:5}  Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane /prO'fAn/[不敬] the Sabbath and are guiltless? /gilt/[罪愆]
{Mat 12:5}  再者，律法上所记的，当安息日，祭司在殿里犯了安息日还是没有罪，你们没有念过吗？
{Mat 12:6}  I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
{Mat 12:6}  但我告诉你们，在这里有一人比殿更大。
{Mat 12:7}  And if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless.
{Mat 12:7}  ‘我喜爱怜恤，不喜爱祭祀。’你们若明白这话的意思，就不将无罪的当作有罪的了。
{Mat 12:8}  For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."
{Mat 12:8}  因为人子是安息日的主。”
{Mat 12:9}  He went on from there and entered their synagogue.
{Mat 12:9}  耶稣离开那地方，进了一个会堂。
{Mat 12:10} And a man was there with a withered hand. And they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"—so that they might accuse him.
{Mat 12:10} 那里有一个人枯干了一只手。有人问耶稣说：“安息日治病可以不可以？”意思是要控告他。
{Mat 12:11} He said to them, "Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?
{Mat 12:11} 耶稣说：“你们中间谁有一只羊，当安息日掉在坑里，不把他抓住，拉上来呢？
{Mat 12:12} Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."
{Mat 12:12} 人比羊何等贵重呢！所以，在安息日做善事是可以的。”
{Mat 12:13} Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other.
{Mat 12:13} 于是对那人说：“伸出手来！”他把手一伸，手就复了原，和那只手一样。
{Mat 12:14} But the Pharisees went out and conspired /kCn'spIr/[图谋 < 同声共气] against him, how to destroy him.
{Mat 12:14} 法利赛人出去，商议怎样可以除灭耶稣。
{Mat 12:15} Jesus, aware /a'wAr/[有意识] of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all
{Mat 12:15} 耶稣知道了，就离开那里，有许多人跟着他。他把其中有病的人都治好了；
{Mat 12:16} and ordered them not to make him known.
{Mat 12:16} 又嘱咐他们，不要给他传名。
{Mat 12:17} This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
{Mat 12:17} 这是要应验先知以赛亚的话，说：
{Mat 12:18} "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, /tSOzen/ my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.
{Mat 12:18} 看哪！我的仆人，我所拣选，所亲爱，心里所喜悦的，我要将我的灵赐给他；他必将公理传给外邦。
{Mat 12:19} He will not quarrel /kwarel/[争吵] or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets;
{Mat 12:19} 他不争竞，不喧嚷；街上也没有人听见他的声音。
{Mat 12:20} a bruised /brws/[挫伤] reed he will not break, and a smoldering /smOldcr/[闷烧] wick [灯芯] he will not quench, /kwentS/[熄灭] until he brings justice to victory;
{Mat 12:20} 压伤的芦苇，他不折断；将残的灯火，他不吹灭；等他施行公理，叫公理得胜。
{Mat 12:21} and in his name the Gentiles will hope."
{Mat 12:21} 外邦人都要仰望他的名。
{Mat 12:22} Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw.
{Mat 12:22} 当下，有人将一个被鬼附着、又瞎又哑的人带到耶稣那里，耶稣就医治他，甚至那哑巴又能说话，又能看见。
{Mat 12:23} And all the people were amazed, and said, "Can this be the Son of David?"
{Mat 12:23} 众人都惊奇，说：“这不是大卫的子孙吗？”
{Mat 12:24} But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons."
{Mat 12:24} 但法利赛人听见，就说：“这个人赶鬼，无非是靠着鬼王别西卜啊。”
{Mat 12:25} Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand.
{Mat 12:25} 耶稣知道他们的意念，就对他们说：“凡一国自相分争，就成为荒场；一城一家自相分争，必站立不住；
{Mat 12:26} And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
{Mat 12:26} 若撒但赶逐撒但，就是自相分争，他的国怎能站得住呢？
{Mat 12:27} And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
{Mat 12:27} 我若靠着别西卜赶鬼，你们的子弟赶鬼又靠着谁呢？这样，他们就要断定你们的是非。
{Mat 12:28} But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
{Mat 12:28} 我若靠着神的灵赶鬼，这就是神的国临到你们了。
{Mat 12:29} Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder /plcndcr/[抢夺] his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house.
{Mat 12:29} 人怎能进壮士家里，抢夺他的家具呢？除非先捆住那壮士，才可以抢夺他的家财。
{Mat 12:30} Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
{Mat 12:30} 不与我相合的，就是敌我的；不同我收聚的，就是分散的。”
{Mat 12:31} Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
{Mat 12:31} 所以我告诉你们：“人一切的罪和亵渎的话都可得赦免，惟独亵渎圣灵，总不得赦免。
{Mat 12:32} And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
{Mat 12:32} 凡说话干犯人子的，还可得赦免；惟独说话干犯圣灵的，今世来世总不得赦免。”
{Mat 12:33} "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit.
{Mat 12:33} “你们或以为树好，果子也好；树坏，果子也坏；因为看果子就可以知道树。
{Mat 12:34} You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
{Mat 12:34} 毒蛇的种类！你们既是恶人，怎能说出好话来呢？因为心里所充满的，口里就说出来。
{Mat 12:35} The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil.
{Mat 12:35} 善人从他心里所存的善就发出善来；恶人从他心里所存的恶就发出恶来。
{Mat 12:36} I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak,
{Mat 12:36} 我又告诉你们，凡人所说的闲话，当审判的日子，必要句句供出来；
{Mat 12:37} for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."
{Mat 12:37} 因为要凭你的话定你为义，也要凭你的话定你有罪。”
{Mat 12:38} Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you."
{Mat 12:38} 当时，有几个文士和法利赛人对耶稣说：“夫子，我们愿意你显个神迹给我们看。”
{Mat 12:39} But he answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
{Mat 12:39} 耶稣回答说：“一个邪恶淫乱的世代求看神迹，除了先知约拿的神迹以外，再没有神迹给他们看。
{Mat 12:40} For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
{Mat 12:40} 约拿三日三夜在大鱼肚腹中，人子也要这样三日三夜在地里头。
{Mat 12:41} The men of Nineveh /nineve/ will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
{Mat 12:41} 当审判的时候，尼尼微人要起来定这世代的罪，因为尼尼微人听了约拿所传的就悔改了。看哪，在这里有一人比约拿更大！
{Mat 12:42} The queen /kwEn/[王后 < king变音] of the South /sauth/[南方] will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
{Mat 12:42} 当审判的时候，南方的女王要起来定这世代的罪，因为他从地极而来，要听所罗门的智慧话。看哪！在这里有一人比所罗门更大。”
{Mat 12:43} "When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none.
{Mat 12:43} “污鬼离了人身，就在无水之地过来过去，寻求安歇之处，却寻不着。
{Mat 12:44} Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order.
{Mat 12:44} 于是说：‘我要回到我所出来的屋里去。’到了，就看见里面空闲，打扫干净，修饰好了，
{Mat 12:45} Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation."
{Mat 12:45} 便去另带了七个比自己更恶的鬼来，都进去住在那里。那人末后的景况比先前更不好了。这邪恶的世代也要如此。”
{Mat 12:46} While he was still speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him.
{Mat 12:46} 耶稣还对众人说话的时候，不料他母亲和他弟兄站在外边，要与他说话。
{Mat 12:47} Someone told him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, asking to speak to you"
{Mat 12:47} 有人告诉他说：“看哪，你母亲和你弟兄站在外边，要与你说话。”
{Mat 12:48} But he replied to the man who told him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
{Mat 12:48} 他却回答那人说：“谁是我的母亲？谁是我的弟兄？”
{Mat 12:49} And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
{Mat 12:49} 就伸手指着门徒，说：“看哪，我的母亲，我的弟兄。
{Mat 12:50} For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”
{Mat 12:50} 凡遵行我天父旨意的人，就是我的弟兄姐妹和母亲了。”
{Mat 13:1}  That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.
{Mat 13:1}  当那一天，耶稣从房子里出来，坐在海边。
{Mat 13:2}  And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. /bEtS/[海滩]
{Mat 13:2}  有许多人到他那里聚集，他只得上船坐下，众人都站在岸上。
{Mat 13:3}  And he told them many things in parables, saying: "A sower went out to sow.
{Mat 13:3}  他用比喻对他们讲许多道理，说：“有一个撒种的出去撒种；
{Mat 13:4}  And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.
{Mat 13:4}  撒的时候，有落在路旁的，飞鸟来吃尽了；
{Mat 13:5}  Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil,
{Mat 13:5}  有落在土浅石头地上的，土既不深，发苗最快，
{Mat 13:6}  but when the sun rose they were scorched. /skortS/[烧焦] And since they had no root, they withered away.
{Mat 13:6}  日头出来一晒，因为没有根，就枯干了；
{Mat 13:7}  Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked /tSOk/[窒息] them.
{Mat 13:7}  有落在荆棘里的，荆棘长起来，把他挤住了；
{Mat 13:8}  Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
{Mat 13:8}  又有落在好土里的，就结实，有一百倍的，有六十倍的，有三十倍的。
{Mat 13:9}  He who has ears, let him hear."
{Mat 13:9}  有耳可听的，就应当听！”
{Mat 13:10} Then the disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
{Mat 13:10} 门徒进前来，问耶稣说：“对众人讲话，为什么用比喻呢？”
{Mat 13:11} And he answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.
{Mat 13:11} 耶稣回答说：“因为天国的奥秘只叫你们知道，不叫他们知道。
{Mat 13:12} For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
{Mat 13:12} 凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有余；凡没有的，连他所有的，也要夺去。
{Mat 13:13} This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
{Mat 13:13} 所以我用比喻对他们讲，是因他们看也看不见，听也听不见，也不明白。
{Mat 13:14} Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: "'"You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive." [察觉 < 完全抓住]
{Mat 13:14} 在他们身上，正应了以赛亚的预言，说：你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不晓得；
{Mat 13:15} For this people's heart has grown dull, /dcl/[呆滞] and with their ears they can barely /bAr/[赤裸、仅有] hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'
{Mat 13:15} 因为这百姓油蒙了心，耳朵发沉，眼睛闭着，恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，我就医治他们。
{Mat 13:16} But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
{Mat 13:16} “但你们的眼睛是有福的，因为看见了；你们的耳朵也是有福的，因为听见了。
{Mat 13:17} For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
{Mat 13:17} 我实在告诉你们，从前有许多先知和义人要看你们所看的，却没有看见，要听你们所听的，却没有听见。”
{Mat 13:18} "Hear then the parable of the sower:
{Mat 13:18} “所以，你们当听这撒种的比喻。
{Mat 13:19} When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches /snxtS/[攫取] away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.
{Mat 13:19} 凡听见天国道理不明白的，那恶者就来，把所撒在他心里的夺了去；这就是撒在路旁的了。
{Mat 13:20} As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,
{Mat 13:20} 撒在石头地上的，就是人听了道，当下欢喜领受，
{Mat 13:21} yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation /tribU'lASCn/[苦难] or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away.
{Mat 13:21} 只因心里没有根，不过是暂时的，及至为道遭了患难，或是受了逼迫，立刻就跌倒了。
{Mat 13:22} As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness /dE'sEt/[谎言] of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. [无效果的]
{Mat 13:22} 撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，后来有世上的思虑、钱财的迷惑把道挤住了，不能结实。
{Mat 13:23} As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, /yild/[产量] in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty."
{Mat 13:23} 撒在好地上的，就是人听道明白了，后来结实，有一百倍的，有六十倍的，有三十倍的。”
{Mat 13:24} He put another parable before them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field,
{Mat 13:24} 耶稣又设个比喻对他们说：“天国好像人撒好种在田里，
{Mat 13:25} but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds /wEd/[野草] among the wheat and went away.
{Mat 13:25} 及至人睡觉的时候，有仇敌来，将稗子撒在麦子里就走了。
{Mat 13:26} So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.
{Mat 13:26} 到长苗吐穗的时候，稗子也显出来。
{Mat 13:27} And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?'
{Mat 13:27} 田主的仆人来告诉他说：‘主啊，你不是撒好种在田里吗？从那里来的稗子呢？’
{Mat 13:28} He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, 'Then do you want us to go and gather them?'
{Mat 13:28} 主人说：‘这是仇敌做的。’仆人说：‘你要我们去薅出来吗？’
{Mat 13:29} But he said, 'No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them.
{Mat 13:29} 主人说：‘不必，恐怕薅稗子，连麦子也拔出来。
{Mat 13:30} Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, /rEp/[收割] Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles /bcndl/[捆] to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'"
{Mat 13:30} 容这两样一齐长，等着收割。当收割的时候，我要对收割的人说，先将稗子薅出来，捆成捆，留着烧；惟有麦子要收在仓里。’”
{Mat 13:31} He put another parable before them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. /fEld/
{Mat 13:31} 他又设个比喻对他们说：“天国好像一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在田里。
{Mat 13:32} It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches."
{Mat 13:32} 这原是百种里最小的，等到长起来，却比各样的菜都大，且成了树，天上的飞鸟来宿在他的枝上。”
{Mat 13:33} He told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, /flaur/[面粉] till it was all leavened."
{Mat 13:33} 他又对他们讲个比喻说：“天国好像面酵，有妇人拿来，藏在三斗面里，直等全团都发起来。”
{Mat 13:34} All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable.
{Mat 13:34} 这都是耶稣用比喻对众人说的话；若不用比喻，就不对他们说什么。
{Mat 13:35} This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world."
{Mat 13:35} 这是要应验先知的话，说：我要开口用比喻，把创世以来所隐藏的事发明出来。
{Mat 13:36} Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain /ek'splAn/[解释] to us the parable of the weeds of the field."
{Mat 13:36} 当下，耶稣离开众人，进了房子。他的门徒进前来，说：“请把田间稗子的比喻讲给我们听。”
{Mat 13:37} He answered, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
{Mat 13:37} 他回答说：“那撒好种的就是人子；
{Mat 13:38} The field is the world, and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,
{Mat 13:38} 田地就是世界；好种就是天国之子；稗子就是那恶者之子；
{Mat 13:39} and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
{Mat 13:39} 撒稗子的仇敌就是魔鬼；收割的时候就是世界的末了；收割的人就是天使。
{Mat 13:40} Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age.
{Mat 13:40} 将稗子薅出来用火焚烧，世界的末了也要如此。
{Mat 13:41} The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, [违法者]
{Mat 13:41} 人子要差遣使者，把一切叫人跌倒的和作恶的，从他国里挑出来，
{Mat 13:42} and throw them into the fiery /fIry/[火的] furnace. /fcrnas/[炉子] In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
{Mat 13:42} 丢在火炉里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。
{Mat 13:43} Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.
{Mat 13:43} 那时，义人在他们父的国里，要发出光来，像太阳一样。有耳可听的，就应当听！”
{Mat 13:44} "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
{Mat 13:44} “天国好像宝贝藏在地里，人遇见了就把他藏起来，欢欢喜喜的去变卖一切所有的，买这块地。
{Mat 13:45} "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant /mcrtSant/[买卖人] in search of fine pearls,
{Mat 13:45} 天国又好像买卖人寻找好珠子，
{Mat 13:46} who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.
{Mat 13:46} 遇见一颗重价的珠子，就去变卖他一切所有的，买了这颗珠子。
{Mat 13:47} "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.
{Mat 13:47} 天国又好像网撒在海里，聚拢各样水族，
{Mat 13:48} When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted /sort/[分类] the good into containers /kCn'tAncr/[容器] but threw away the bad.
{Mat 13:48} 网既满了，人就拉上岸来，坐下，拣好的收在器具里，将不好的丢弃了。
{Mat 13:49} So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous
{Mat 13:49} 世界的末了也要这样。天使要出来，从义人中把恶人分别出来，
{Mat 13:50} and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
{Mat 13:50} 丢在火炉里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。”
{Mat 13:51} "Have you understood all these things?" They said to him, "Yes."
{Mat 13:51} 耶稣说：“这一切的话你们都明白了吗？”他们说：“我们明白了。”
{Mat 13:52} And he said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been trained /trAn/[训练] for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."
{Mat 13:52} 他说：“凡文士受教作天国的门徒，就像一个家主从他库里拿出新旧的东西来。”
{Mat 13:53} And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there,
{Mat 13:53} 耶稣说完了这些比喻，就离开那里，
{Mat 13:54} and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?
{Mat 13:54} 来到自己的家乡，在会堂里教训人，甚至他们都希奇，说：“这人从那里有这等智慧和异能呢？
{Mat 13:55} Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
{Mat 13:55} 这不是木匠的儿子吗？他母亲不是叫马利亚吗？他弟兄们不是叫雅各、约西（有古卷：约瑟）、西门、犹大吗？
{Mat 13:56} And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?"
{Mat 13:56} 他妹妹们不是都在我们这里吗？这人从那里有这一切的事呢？”
{Mat 13:57} And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household."
{Mat 13:57} 他们就厌弃他（厌弃他：原文作因他跌倒）。耶稣对他们说：“大凡先知，除了本地本家之外，没有不被人尊敬的。”
{Mat 13:58} And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.
{Mat 13:58} 耶稣因为他们不信，就在那里不多行异能了。
{Mat 14:1}  At that time Herod the tetrarch [分封的王] heard about the fame of Jesus,
{Mat 14:1}  那时，分封的王希律听见耶稣的名声，
{Mat 14:2}  and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous /mi'rxkUlcs/[奇迹的] powers are at work in him."
{Mat 14:2}  就对臣仆说：“这是施洗的约翰从死里复活，所以这些异能从他里面发出来。”
{Mat 14:3}  For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,
{Mat 14:3}  起先，希律为他兄弟腓力的妻子希罗底的缘故，把约翰拿住，锁在监里。
{Mat 14:4}  because John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
{Mat 14:4}  因为约翰曾对他说：“你娶这妇人是不合理的。”
{Mat 14:5}  And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.
{Mat 14:5}  希律就想要杀他，只是怕百姓，因为他们以约翰为先知。
{Mat 14:6}  But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod,
{Mat 14:6}  到了希律的生日，希罗底的女儿在众人面前跳舞，使希律欢喜。
{Mat 14:7}  so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
{Mat 14:7}  希律就起誓，应许随他所求的给他。
{Mat 14:8}  Prompted /prompt/[提示] by her mother, she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."
{Mat 14:8}  女儿被母亲所使，就说：“请把施洗约翰的头放在盘子里，拿来给我。”
{Mat 14:9}  And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given.
{Mat 14:9}  王便忧愁，但因他所起的誓，又因同席的人，就吩咐给他；
{Mat 14:10} He sent and had John beheaded in the prison,
{Mat 14:10} 于是打发人去，在监里斩了约翰，
{Mat 14:11} and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
{Mat 14:11} 把头放在盘子里，拿来给了女子；女子拿去给他母亲。
{Mat 14:12} And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.
{Mat 14:12} 约翰的门徒来，把尸首领去埋葬了，就去告诉耶稣。
{Mat 14:13} Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
{Mat 14:13} 耶稣听见了，就上船从那里独自退到野地里去。众人听见，就从各城里步行跟随他。
{Mat 14:14} When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
{Mat 14:14} 耶稣出来，见有许多的人，就怜悯他们，治好了他们的病人。
{Mat 14:15} Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
{Mat 14:15} 天将晚的时候，门徒进前来，说：“这是野地，时候已经过了，请叫众人散开，他们好往村子里去，自己买吃的。”
{Mat 14:16} But Jesus said, "They need not go away; you give them something to eat."
{Mat 14:16} 耶稣说：“不用他们去，你们给他们吃吧！”
{Mat 14:17} They said to him, "We have only five loaves here and two fish."
{Mat 14:17} 门徒说：“我们这里只有五个饼，两条鱼。”
{Mat 14:18} And he said, "Bring them here to me."
{Mat 14:18} 耶稣说：“拿过来给我。”
{Mat 14:19} Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
{Mat 14:19} 于是吩咐众人坐在草地上，就拿着这五个饼，两条鱼，望着天祝福，擘开饼，递给门徒，门徒又递给众人。
{Mat 14:20} And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
{Mat 14:20} 他们都吃，并且吃饱了；把剩下的零碎收拾起来，装满了十二个篮子。
{Mat 14:21} And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
{Mat 14:21} 吃的人，除了妇女孩子，约有五千。
{Mat 14:22} Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed /dis'mis/[解散] the crowds.
{Mat 14:22} 耶稣随即催门徒上船，先渡到那边去，等他叫众人散开。
{Mat 14:23} And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,
{Mat 14:23} 散了众人以后，他就独自上山去祷告。到了晚上，只有他一人在那里。
{Mat 14:24} but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them.
{Mat 14:24} 那时船在海中，因风不顺，被浪摇撼。
{Mat 14:25} And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.
{Mat 14:25} 夜里四更天，耶稣在海面上走，往门徒那里去。
{Mat 14:26} But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!" and they cried out in fear.
{Mat 14:26} 门徒看见他在海面上走，就惊慌了，说：“是个鬼怪！”便害怕，喊叫起来。
{Mat 14:27} But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid."
{Mat 14:27} 耶稣连忙对他们说：“你们放心！是我，不要怕！”
{Mat 14:28} And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
{Mat 14:28} 彼得说：“主，如果是你，请叫我从水面上走到你那里去。”
{Mat 14:29} He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.
{Mat 14:29} 耶稣说：“你来吧。”彼得就从船上下去，在水面上走，要到耶稣那里去；
{Mat 14:30} But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink /sink/[下沉] he cried out, "Lord, save me."
{Mat 14:30} 只因见风甚大，就害怕，将要沉下去，便喊着说：“主啊，救我！”
{Mat 14:31} Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?" /daut/[怀疑]
{Mat 14:31} 耶稣赶紧伸手拉住他，说：“你这小信的人哪，为什么疑惑呢？”
{Mat 14:32} And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
{Mat 14:32} 他们上了船，风就住了。
{Mat 14:33} And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."
{Mat 14:33} 在船上的人都拜他，说：“你真是神的儿子了。”
{Mat 14:34} And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. /dZene'saret/
{Mat 14:34} 他们过了海，来到革尼撒勒地方。
{Mat 14:35} And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick
{Mat 14:35} 那里的人一认出是耶稣，就打发人到周围地方去，把所有的病人带到他那里，
{Mat 14:36} and implored /im'plor/[恳求] him that they might only touch the fringe /frindZ/[边缘] of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.
{Mat 14:36} 只求耶稣准他们摸他的衣裳䍁子；摸着的人就都好了。
{Mat 15:1}  Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,
{Mat 15:1}  那时，有法利赛人和文士从耶路撒冷来见耶稣，说：
{Mat 15:2}  "Why do your disciples break the tradition /tra'diSCn/[传统] of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat."
{Mat 15:2}  “你的门徒为什么犯古人的遗传呢？因为吃饭的时候，他们不洗手。”
{Mat 15:3}  He answered them, "And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
{Mat 15:3}  耶稣回答说：“你们为什么因着你们的遗传犯神的诫命呢？
{Mat 15:4}  For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.'
{Mat 15:4}  神说：‘当孝敬父母’；又说：‘咒骂父母的，必治死他。’
{Mat 15:5}  But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother, "What you would have gained from me is given to God,"
{Mat 15:5}  你们倒说：‘无论何人对父母说：我所当奉给你的已经作了供献，
{Mat 15:6}  he need not honor his father.' So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God.
{Mat 15:6}  他就可以不孝敬父母。’这就是你们藉着遗传，废了神的诫命。
{Mat 15:7}  You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:
{Mat 15:7}  假冒为善的人哪，以赛亚指着你们说的预言是不错的。他说：
{Mat 15:8}  "'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;
{Mat 15:8}  这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我；
{Mat 15:9}  in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines /doktrin/[教条] the commandments of men.'"
{Mat 15:9}  他们将人的吩咐当作道理教导人，所以拜我也是枉然。”
{Mat 15:10} And he called the people to him and said to them, "Hear and understand:
{Mat 15:10} 耶稣就叫了众人来，对他们说：“你们要听，也要明白。
{Mat 15:11} it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles /dE'fIl/[弄脏] a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person."
{Mat 15:11} 入口的不能污秽人，出口的乃能污秽人。”
{Mat 15:12} Then the disciples came and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"
{Mat 15:12} 当时，门徒进前来对他说：“法利赛人听见这话，不服（原文作跌倒），你知道吗？”
{Mat 15:13} He answered, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.
{Mat 15:13} 耶稣回答说：“凡栽种的物，若不是我天父栽种的，必要拔出来。
{Mat 15:14} Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."
{Mat 15:14} 任凭他们吧！他们是瞎眼领路的；若是瞎子领瞎子，两个人都要掉在坑里。”
{Mat 15:15} But Peter said to him, "Explain the parable to us."
{Mat 15:15} 彼得对耶稣说：“请将这比喻讲给我们听。”
{Mat 15:16} And he said, "Are you also still without understanding?
{Mat 15:16} 耶稣说：“你们到如今还不明白吗？
{Mat 15:17} Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled? /ek'spel/[排出]
{Mat 15:17} 岂不知凡入口的，是运到肚子里，又落在茅厕里吗？
{Mat 15:18} But what comes out of the mouth proceeds /prO'sEd/[进行] from the heart, and this defiles a person.
{Mat 15:18} 惟独出口的，是从心里发出来的，这才污秽人。
{Mat 15:19} For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander. /slxndcr/[诽谤]
{Mat 15:19} 因为从心里发出来的，有恶念、凶杀、奸淫、苟合、偷盗、妄证、谤渎。
{Mat 15:20} These are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone."
{Mat 15:20} 这都是污秽人的；至于不洗手吃饭，那却不污秽人。”
{Mat 15:21} And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
{Mat 15:21} 耶稣离开那里，退到推罗、西顿的境内去。
{Mat 15:22} And behold, a Canaanite /kAnanIt/ woman from that region came out and was crying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely /sE'vEr/[严重的] oppressed by a demon."
{Mat 15:22} 有一个迦南妇人，从那地方出来，喊着说：“主啊，大卫的子孙，可怜我！我女儿被鬼附得甚苦。”
{Mat 15:23} But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us."
{Mat 15:23} 耶稣却一言不答。门徒进前来，求他说：“这妇人在我们后头喊叫，请打发他走吧。”
{Mat 15:24} He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
{Mat 15:24} 耶稣说：“我奉差遣不过是到以色列家迷失的羊那里去。”
{Mat 15:25} But she came and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, help me."
{Mat 15:25} 那妇人来拜他，说：“主啊，帮助我！”
{Mat 15:26} And he answered, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
{Mat 15:26} 他回答说：“不好拿儿女的饼丢给狗吃。”
{Mat 15:27} She said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs /krCm/[面包碎] that fall from their masters' table."
{Mat 15:27} 妇人说：“主啊，不错；但是狗也吃他主人桌子上掉下来的碎渣儿。”
{Mat 15:28} Then Jesus answered her, "O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed instantly. [即刻]
{Mat 15:28} 耶稣说：“妇人，你的信心是大的！照你所要的，给你成全了吧。”从那时候，他女儿就好了。
{Mat 15:29} Jesus went on from there and walked beside the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain and sat down there.
{Mat 15:29} 耶稣离开那地方，来到靠近加利利的海边，就上山坐下。
{Mat 15:30} And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, /kripl/[伤残] the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them,
{Mat 15:30} 有许多人到他那里，带着瘸子、瞎子、哑巴、有残疾的，和好些别的病人，都放在他脚前；他就治好了他们。
{Mat 15:31} so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
{Mat 15:31} 甚至众人都希奇；因为看见哑巴说话，残疾的痊愈，瘸子行走，瞎子看见，他们就归荣耀给以色列的神。
{Mat 15:32} Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
{Mat 15:32} 耶稣叫门徒来，说：“我怜悯这众人，因为他们同我在这里已经三天，也没有吃的了。我不愿意叫他们饿着回去，恐怕在路上困乏。”
{Mat 15:33} And the disciples said to him, "Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?"
{Mat 15:33} 门徒说：“我们在这野地，那里有这么多的饼叫这许多人吃饱呢？”
{Mat 15:34} And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
{Mat 15:34} 耶稣说：“你们有多少饼？”他们说：“有七个，还有几条小鱼。”
{Mat 15:35} And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground,
{Mat 15:35} 他就吩咐众人坐在地上，
{Mat 15:36} he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
{Mat 15:36} 拿着这七个饼和几条鱼，祝谢了，擘开，递给门徒；门徒又递给众人。
{Mat 15:37} And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
{Mat 15:37} 众人都吃，并且吃饱了，收拾剩下的零碎，装满了七个筐子。
{Mat 15:38} Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
{Mat 15:38} 吃的人，除了妇女孩子，共有四千。
{Mat 15:39} And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan. /mxga'dxn/
{Mat 15:39} 耶稣叫众人散去，就上船，来到马加丹的境界。
{Mat 16:1}  And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
{Mat 16:1}  法利赛人和撒都该人来试探耶稣，请他从天上显个神迹给他们看。
{Mat 16:2}  He answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair /fAr/[睛朗的、公正的、美好的事物] weather, for the sky is red.'
{Mat 16:2}  耶稣回答说：“晚上天发红，你们就说：‘天必要晴。’
{Mat 16:3}  And in the morning, 'It will be stormy /stormy/[暴风雨] today, for the sky is red and threatening.' /threten/[威胁] You know how to interpret /in'tcrpret/[翻译] the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.
{Mat 16:3}  早晨天发红，又发黑，你们就说：‘今日必有风雨。”你们知道分辨天上的气色，倒不能分辨这时候的神迹。
{Mat 16:4}  An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." So he left them and departed.
{Mat 16:4}  一个邪恶淫乱的世代求神迹，除了约拿的神迹以外，再没有神迹给他看。”耶稣就离开他们去了。
{Mat 16:5}  When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread.
{Mat 16:5}  门徒渡到那边去，忘了带饼。
{Mat 16:6}  Jesus said to them, "Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
{Mat 16:6}  耶稣对他们说：“你们要谨慎，防备法利赛人和撒都该人的酵。”
{Mat 16:7}  And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, "We brought no bread."
{Mat 16:7}  门徒彼此议论说：“这是因为我们没有带饼吧。”
{Mat 16:8}  But Jesus, aware of this, said, "O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?
{Mat 16:8}  耶稣看出来，就说：“你们这小信的人，为什么因为没有饼彼此议论呢？
{Mat 16:9}  Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?
{Mat 16:9}  你们还不明白吗？不记得那五个饼分给五千人、又收拾了多少篮子的零碎吗？
{Mat 16:10} Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?
{Mat 16:10} 也不记得那七个饼分给四千人、又收拾了多少筐子的零碎吗？
{Mat 16:11} How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
{Mat 16:11} 我对你们说：‘要防备法利赛人和撒都该人的酵’，这话不是指着饼说的，你们怎么不明白呢？”
{Mat 16:12} Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
{Mat 16:12} 门徒这才晓得他说的不是叫他们防备饼的酵，乃是防备法利赛人和撒都该人的教训。
{Mat 16:13} Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea /sAsa'rEa/ Philippi, /filipI/ he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
{Mat 16:13} 耶稣到了该撒利亚腓立比的境内，就问门徒说：“人说我（有古卷没有我字），人子是谁？”
{Mat 16:14} And they said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
{Mat 16:14} 他们说：“有人说是施洗的约翰；有人说是以利亚；又有人说是耶利米或是先知里的一位。”
{Mat 16:15} He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
{Mat 16:15} 耶稣说：“你们说我是谁？”
{Mat 16:16} Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
{Mat 16:16} 西门彼得回答说：“你是基督，是永生神的儿子。”
{Mat 16:17} And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
{Mat 16:17} 耶稣对他说：“西门巴约拿，你是有福的！因为这不是属血肉的指示你的，乃是我在天上的父指示的。
{Mat 16:18} And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail /prE'vAl/[胜过 < 在前面动] against it.
{Mat 16:18} 我还告诉你，你是彼得，我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上；阴间的权柄（权柄：原文作门），不能胜过他。
{Mat 16:19} I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
{Mat 16:19} 我要把天国的钥匙给你，凡你在地上所捆绑的，在天上也要捆绑；凡你在地上所释放的，在天上也要释放。”
{Mat 16:20} Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.
{Mat 16:20} 当下，耶稣嘱咐门徒，不可对人说他是基督。
{Mat 16:21} From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
{Mat 16:21} 从此，耶稣才指示门徒，他必须上耶路撒冷去，受长老、祭司长、文士许多的苦，并且被杀，第三日复活。
{Mat 16:22} And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you."
{Mat 16:22} 彼得就拉着他，劝他说：“主啊，万不可如此！这事必不临到你身上。”
{Mat 16:23} But he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance /hind,rans/[阻碍物] to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
{Mat 16:23} 耶稣转过来，对彼得说：“撒但，退我后边去吧！你是绊我脚的；因为你不体贴神的意思，只体贴人的意思。”
{Mat 16:24} Then Jesus told his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
{Mat 16:24} 于是耶稣对门徒说：“若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我。
{Mat 16:25} For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
{Mat 16:25} 因为，凡要救自己生命（生命：译灵魂；下同）的，必丧掉生命；凡为我丧掉生命的，必得着生命。
{Mat 16:26} For what will it profit /profit/[利益] a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits /forfit/[丧失] his soul? Or what shall a man give in [phr.v. 给入] return for his soul?
{Mat 16:26} 人若赚得全世界，赔上自己的生命，有什么益处呢？人还能拿什么换生命呢？
{Mat 16:27} For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay /rE'pA/[付还] each person according to what he has done.
{Mat 16:27} 人子要在他父的荣耀里同着众使者降临；那时候，他要照各人的行为报应各人。
{Mat 16:28} Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
{Mat 16:28} 我实在告诉你们，站在这里的，有人在没尝死味以前必看见人子降临在他的国里。”
{Mat 17:1}  And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
{Mat 17:1}  过了六天，耶稣带着彼得、雅各，和雅各的兄弟约翰，暗暗的上了高山，
{Mat 17:2}  And he was transfigured /trxns'figUr/[美化] before them, and his face shone /Son/ like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
{Mat 17:2}  就在他们面前变了形像，脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白如光。
{Mat 17:3}  And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.
{Mat 17:3}  忽然，有摩西、以利亚向他们显现，同耶稣说话。
{Mat 17:4}  And Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."
{Mat 17:4}  彼得对耶稣说：“主啊，我们在这里真好！你若愿意，我就在这里搭三座棚，一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。”
{Mat 17:5}  He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him."
{Mat 17:5}  说话之间，忽然有一朵光明的云彩遮盖他们，且有声音从云彩里出来，说：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。你们要听他！”
{Mat 17:6}  When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified.
{Mat 17:6}  门徒听见，就俯伏在地，极其害怕。
{Mat 17:7}  But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Rise, and have no fear."
{Mat 17:7}  耶稣进前来，摸他们，说：“起来，不要害怕！”
{Mat 17:8}  And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.
{Mat 17:8}  他们举目不见一人，只见耶稣在那里。
{Mat 17:9}  And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, "Tell no one the vision, /viZCn/ until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
{Mat 17:9}  下山的时候，耶稣吩咐他们说：“人子还没有从死里复活，你们不要将所看见的告诉人。”
{Mat 17:10} And the disciples asked him, "Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?"
{Mat 17:10} 门徒问耶稣说：“文士为什么说以利亚必须先来？”
{Mat 17:11} He answered, "Elijah does come, and he will restore all things.
{Mat 17:11} 耶稣回答说：“以利亚固然先来，并要复兴万事；
{Mat 17:12} But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands."
{Mat 17:12} 只是我告诉你们，以利亚已经来了，人却不认识他，竟任意待他。人子也将要这样受他们的害。”
{Mat 17:13} Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.
{Mat 17:13} 门徒这才明白耶稣所说的是指着施洗的约翰。
{Mat 17:14} And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and, kneeling before him,
{Mat 17:14} 耶稣和门徒到了众人那里，有一个人来见耶稣，跪下，
{Mat 17:15} said, "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.
{Mat 17:15} 说：“主啊，怜悯我的儿子。他害癫痫的病很苦，屡次跌在火里，屡次跌在水里。
{Mat 17:16} And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him."
{Mat 17:16} 我带他到你门徒那里，他们却不能医治他。”
{Mat 17:17} And Jesus answered, "O faithless and twisted [扭] generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me."
{Mat 17:17} 耶稣说：“嗳！这又不信又悖谬的世代啊，我在你们这里要到几时呢？我忍耐你们要到几时呢？把他带到我这里来吧！”
{Mat 17:18} And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly.
{Mat 17:18} 耶稣斥责那鬼，鬼就出来；从此孩子就痊愈了。
{Mat 17:19} Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"
{Mat 17:19} 门徒暗暗的到耶稣跟前，说：“我们为什么不能赶出那鬼呢？”
{Mat 17:20} He said to them, "Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you."
{Mat 17:20} 耶稣说：“是因你们的信心小。我实在告诉你们，你们若有信心，像一粒芥菜种，就是对这座山说：‘你从这边挪到那边。’他也必挪去；并且你们没有一件不能做的事了。
{Mat 17:21} But this kind never comes out except by prayer and fasting.
{Mat 17:21} 至于这一类的鬼，若不祷告、禁食，他就不出来（或作：不能赶他出来）。”
{Mat 17:22} As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,
{Mat 17:22} 他们还住在加利利的时候，耶稣对门徒说：“人子将要被交在人手里。
{Mat 17:23} and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day." And they were greatly distressed. [忧伤]
{Mat 17:23} 他们要杀害他，第三日他要复活。”门徒就大大的忧愁。
{Mat 17:24} When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma /drxkma/ tax went up to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the tax?"
{Mat 17:24} 到了迦百农，有收丁税的人来见彼得，说：“你们的先生不纳丁税（丁税约有半块钱）吗？”
{Mat 17:25} He said, "Yes." And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll /tOl/[通行费] or tax? From their sons or from others?"
{Mat 17:25} 彼得说：“纳。”他进了屋子，耶稣先向他说：“西门，你的意思如何？世上的君王向谁徵收关税、丁税？是向自己的儿子呢？是向外人呢？”
{Mat 17:26} And when he said, "From others," Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are free.
{Mat 17:26} 彼得说：“是向外人。”耶稣说：“既然如此，儿子就可以免税了。
{Mat 17:27} However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.”
{Mat 17:27} 但恐怕触犯（触犯：原文作绊倒）他们，你且往海边去钓鱼，把先钓上来的鱼拿起来，开了他的口，必得一块钱，可以拿去给他们，作你我的税银。”
{Mat 18:1}  At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
{Mat 18:1}  当时，门徒进前来，问耶稣说：“天国里谁是最大的？”
{Mat 18:2}  And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them
{Mat 18:2}  耶稣便叫一个小孩子来，使他站在他们当中，
{Mat 18:3}  and said, "Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
{Mat 18:3}  说：“我实在告诉你们，你们若不回转，变成小孩子的样式，断不得进天国。
{Mat 18:4}  Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
{Mat 18:4}  所以，凡自己谦卑像这小孩子的，他在天国里就是最大的。
{Mat 18:5}  "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me,
{Mat 18:5}  凡为我的名接待一个像这小孩子的，就是接待我。”
{Mat 18:6}  but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone /milstOn/[磨石] fastened /fxsen/[系紧] around his neck and to be drowned /draun/[淹死] in the depth of the sea.
{Mat 18:6}  “凡使这信我的一个小子跌倒的，倒不如把大磨石拴在这人的颈项上，沉在深海里。
{Mat 18:7}  "Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary /'nesesxry/[必需的] that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes!
{Mat 18:7}  这世界有祸了，因为将人绊倒；绊倒人的事是免不了的，但那绊倒人的有祸了！
{Mat 18:8}  And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire.
{Mat 18:8}  倘若你一只手，或是一只脚，叫你跌倒，就砍下来丢掉。你缺一只手，或是一只脚，进入永生，强如有两手两脚被丢在永火里。
{Mat 18:9}  And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.
{Mat 18:9}  倘若你一只眼叫你跌倒，就把他剜出来丢掉。你只有一只眼进入永生，强如有两只眼被丢在地狱的火里。”
{Mat 18:10} "See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
{Mat 18:10} “你们要小心，不可轻看这小子里的一个；我告诉你们，他们的使者在天上，常见我天父的面。（有古卷在此有
{Mat 18:11} For the Son of Man came to save the lost.
{Mat 18:11} 人子来，为要拯救失丧的人。）
{Mat 18:12} What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, /a'strA/[迷途] does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?
{Mat 18:12} 一个人若有一百只羊，一只走迷了路，你们的意思如何？他岂不撇下这九十九只，往山里去找那只迷路的羊吗？
{Mat 18:13} And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray.
{Mat 18:13} 若是找着了，我实在告诉你们，他为这一只羊欢喜，比为那没有迷路的九十九只欢喜还大呢！
{Mat 18:14} So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
{Mat 18:14} 你们在天上的父也是这样，不愿意这小子里失丧一个。”
{Mat 18:15} "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, /folt/[过错] between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
{Mat 18:15} “倘若你的弟兄得罪你，你就去，趁着只有他和你在一处的时候，指出他的错来。他若听你，你便得了你的弟兄；
{Mat 18:16} But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established /E'stxbliS/[确立] by the evidence /evidens/[证词、迹象 < 明显的事物] of two or three witnesses.
{Mat 18:16} 他若不听，你就另外带一两个人同去，要凭两三个人的口作见证，句句都可定准。
{Mat 18:17} If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
{Mat 18:17} 若是不听他们，就告诉教会；若是不听教会，就看他像外邦人和税吏一样。
{Mat 18:18} Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
{Mat 18:18} 我实在告诉你们，凡你们在地上所捆绑的，在天上也要捆绑；凡你们在地上所释放的，在天上也要释放。
{Mat 18:19} Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
{Mat 18:19} 我又告诉你们，若是你们中间有两个人在地上同心合意的求什么事，我在天上的父必为他们成全。
{Mat 18:20} For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." [完全倒装]
{Mat 18:20} 因为无论在那里，有两三个人奉我的名聚会，那里就有我在他们中间。”
{Mat 18:21} Then Peter came up and said to him, "Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?"
{Mat 18:21} 那时，彼得进前来，对耶稣说：“主啊，我弟兄得罪我，我当饶恕他几次呢？到七次可以吗？”
{Mat 18:22} Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.
{Mat 18:22} 耶稣说：“我对你说，不是到七次，乃是到七十个七次。
{Mat 18:23} "Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared /kCm'pAr/[比较] to a king who wished to settle [安放] accounts with his servants.
{Mat 18:23} 天国好像一个王要和他仆人算账。
{Mat 18:24} When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. /txlent/[才能]
{Mat 18:24} 才算的时候，有人带了一个欠一千万银子的来。
{Mat 18:25} And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.
{Mat 18:25} 因为他没有什么偿还之物，主人吩咐把他和他妻子儿女，并一切所有的都卖了偿还。
{Mat 18:26} So the servant fell on his knees, imploring /im'plor/[哀求] him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.'
{Mat 18:26} 那仆人就俯伏拜他，说：‘主啊，宽容我，将来我都要还清。’
{Mat 18:27} And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.
{Mat 18:27} 那仆人的主人就动了慈心，把他释放了，并且免了他的债。
{Mat 18:28} But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, 'Pay what you owe.' /O/[欠]
{Mat 18:28} “那仆人出来，遇见他的一个同伴欠他十两银子，便揪着他，掐住他的喉咙，说：‘你把所欠的还我！’
{Mat 18:29} So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded /plEd/[央求] with him, 'Have patience /pASens/[耐心] with me, and I will pay you.'
{Mat 18:29} 他的同伴就俯伏央求他，说：‘宽容我吧，将来我必还清。’
{Mat 18:30} He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt.
{Mat 18:30} 他不肯，竟去把他下在监里，等他还了所欠的债。
{Mat 18:31} When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place.
{Mat 18:31} 众同伴看见他所做的事就甚忧愁，去把这事都告诉了主人。
{Mat 18:32} Then his master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked /wiked/[邪恶的] servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
{Mat 18:32} 于是主人叫了他来，对他说：‘你这恶奴才！你央求我，我就把你所欠的都免了，
{Mat 18:33} And should not you have had mercy on your fellow /fellO/[同伴] servant, as I had mercy on you?'
{Mat 18:33} 你不应当怜恤你的同伴，像我怜恤你吗？’
{Mat 18:34} And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, /jAlcr/[狱卒] until he should pay all his debt.
{Mat 18:34} 主人就大怒，把他交给掌刑的，等他还清了所欠的债。
{Mat 18:35} So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”
{Mat 18:35} 你们各人若不从心里饶恕你的弟兄，我天父也要这样待你们了。”
{Mat 19:1}  Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
{Mat 19:1}  耶稣说完了这些话，就离开加利利，来到犹太的境界约但河外。
{Mat 19:2}  And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
{Mat 19:2}  有许多人跟着他，他就在那里把他们的病人治好了。
{Mat 19:3}  And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?"
{Mat 19:3}  有法利赛人来试探耶稣，说：“人无论什么缘故都可以休妻吗？”
{Mat 19:4}  He answered, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female,
{Mat 19:4}  耶稣回答说：“那起初造人的，是造男造女，
{Mat 19:5}  and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?
{Mat 19:5}  并且说：‘因此，人要离开父母，与妻子连合，二人成为一体。’这经你们没有念过吗？
{Mat 19:6}  So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined /dZoind/[连接] together, let not man separate."
{Mat 19:6}  既然如此，夫妻不再是两个人，乃是一体的了。所以，神配合的，人不可分开。”
{Mat 19:7}  They said to him, "Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?"
{Mat 19:7}  法利赛人说：“这样，摩西为什么吩咐给妻子休书，就可以休他呢？”
{Mat 19:8}  He said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
{Mat 19:8}  耶稣说：“摩西因为你们的心硬，所以许你们休妻，但起初并不是这样。
{Mat 19:9}  And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."
{Mat 19:9}  我告诉你们，凡休妻另娶的，若不是为淫乱的缘故，就是犯奸淫了；有人娶那被休的妇人，也是犯奸淫了。”
{Mat 19:10} The disciples said to him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."
{Mat 19:10} 门徒对耶稣说：“人和妻子既是这样，倒不如不娶。”
{Mat 19:11} But he said to them, "Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.
{Mat 19:11} 耶稣说：“这话不是人都能领受的，惟独赐给谁，谁才能领受。
{Mat 19:12} For there are eunuchs /Unck/[太监] who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it."
{Mat 19:12} 因为有生来是阉人，也有被人阉的，并有为天国的缘故自阉的。这话谁能领受就可以领受。”
{Mat 19:13} Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people,
{Mat 19:13} 那时，有人带着小孩子来见耶稣，要耶稣给他们按手祷告，门徒就责备那些人。
{Mat 19:14} but Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
{Mat 19:14} 耶稣说：“让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们；因为在天国的，正是这样的人。”
{Mat 19:15} And he laid his hands on them and went away.
{Mat 19:15} 耶稣给他们按手，就离开那地方去了。
{Mat 19:16} And behold, a man came up to him, saying, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
{Mat 19:16} 有一个人来见耶稣，说：“夫子（有古卷：良善的夫子），我该做什么善事才能得永生？”
{Mat 19:17} And he said to him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments."
{Mat 19:17} 耶稣对他说：“你为什么以善事问我呢？只有一位是善的（有古卷：你为什么称我是良善的？除了神以外，没有一个良善的）。你若要进入永生，就当遵守诫命。”
{Mat 19:18} He said to him, "Which ones?" And Jesus said, "You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,
{Mat 19:18} 他说：“什么诫命？”耶稣说：“就是不可杀人；不可奸淫；不可偷盗；不可作假见证；
{Mat 19:19} Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
{Mat 19:19} 当孝敬父母，又当爱人如己。”
{Mat 19:20} The young man said to him, "All these I have kept. What do I still lack?"
{Mat 19:20} 那少年人说：“这一切我都遵守了，还缺少什么呢？”
{Mat 19:21} Jesus said to him, "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
{Mat 19:21} 耶稣说：“你若愿意作完全人，可去变卖你所有的，分给穷人，就必有财宝在天上；你还要来跟从我。”
{Mat 19:22} When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
{Mat 19:22} 那少年人听见这话，就忧忧愁愁的走了，因为他的产业很多。
{Mat 19:23} And Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty [困难] will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven.
{Mat 19:23} 耶稣对门徒说：“我实在告诉你们，财主进天国是难的。
{Mat 19:24} Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
{Mat 19:24} 我又告诉你们，骆驼穿过针的眼，比财主进神的国还容易呢！”
{Mat 19:25} When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"
{Mat 19:25} 门徒听见这话，就希奇得很，说：“这样谁能得救呢？”
{Mat 19:26} But Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
{Mat 19:26} 耶稣看着他们，说：“在人这是不能的，在神凡事都能。”
{Mat 19:27} Then Peter said in reply, "See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?"
{Mat 19:27} 彼得就对他说：“看哪，我们已经撇下所有的跟从你，将来我们要得什么呢？”
{Mat 19:28} Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, /thrOn/[王位、宝座] you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes /trIb/[部落] of Israel.
{Mat 19:28} 耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们，你们这跟从我的人，到复兴的时候，人子坐在他荣耀的宝座上，你们也要坐在十二个宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。
{Mat 19:29} And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.
{Mat 19:29} 凡为我的名撇下房屋，或是弟兄、姐妹、父亲、母亲、（有古卷加：妻子）儿女、田地的，必要得着百倍，并且承受永生。
{Mat 19:30} But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
{Mat 19:30} 然而，有许多在前的，将要在后；在后的，将要在前。”
{Mat 20:1}  "For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
{Mat 20:1}  “因为天国好像家主清早去雇人进他的葡萄园做工，
{Mat 20:2}  After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
{Mat 20:2}  和工人讲定一天一钱银子，就打发他们进葡萄园去。
{Mat 20:3}  And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle /Idl/[无所事事] in the marketplace,
{Mat 20:3}  约在巳初出去，看见市上还有闲站的人，
{Mat 20:4}  and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.'
{Mat 20:4}  就对他们说：‘你们也进葡萄园去，所当给的，我必给你们。’他们也进去了。
{Mat 20:5}  So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same.
{Mat 20:5}  约在午正和申初又出去，也是这样行。
{Mat 20:6}  And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?'
{Mat 20:6}  约在酉初出去，看见还有人站在那里，就问他们说：‘你们为什么整天在这里闲站呢？’
{Mat 20:7}  They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.'
{Mat 20:7}  他们说：‘因为没有人雇我们。’他说：‘你们也进葡萄园去。’
{Mat 20:8}  And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, /forman/[领班 工头] 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, /wAdZ/[工资] beginning with the last, up to the first.'
{Mat 20:8}  到了晚上，园主对管事的说：‘叫工人都来，给他们工钱，从后来的起，到先来的为止。
{Mat 20:9}  And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius.
{Mat 20:9}  约在酉初雇的人来了，各人得了一钱银子。
{Mat 20:10} Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius.
{Mat 20:10} 及至那先雇的来了，他们以为必要多得；谁知也是各得一钱。
{Mat 20:11} And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house,
{Mat 20:11} 他们得了，就埋怨家主说：
{Mat 20:12} saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden /bcrden/[重担] of the day and the scorching heat.' /hEt/[热度]
{Mat 20:12} ‘我们整天劳苦受热，那后来的只做了一小时，你竟叫他们和我们一样吗？’
{Mat 20:13} But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
{Mat 20:13} 家主回答其中的一人说：‘朋友，我不亏负你，你与我讲定的不是一钱银子吗？
{Mat 20:14} Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you.
{Mat 20:14} 拿你的走吧！我给那后来的和给你一样，这是我愿意的。
{Mat 20:15} Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge /bE'grcdZ/[妒忌、吝惜] my generosity?' /dZene'rosity/[慷慨大方]
{Mat 20:15} 我的东西难道不可随我的意思用吗？因为我作好人，你就红了眼吗？’
{Mat 20:16} So the last will be first, and the first last."
{Mat 20:16} 这样，那在后的，将要在前；在前的，将要在后了。（有古卷加：因为被召的人多，选上的人少。）”
{Mat 20:17} And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
{Mat 20:17} 耶稣上耶路撒冷去的时候，在路上把十二个门徒带到一边，对他们说：
{Mat 20:18} "See, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death
{Mat 20:18} “看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，人子要被交给祭司长和文士。他们要定他死罪，
{Mat 20:19} and deliver him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day."
{Mat 20:19} 又交给外邦人，将他戏弄，鞭打，钉在十字架上；第三日他要复活。”
{Mat 20:20} Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something.
{Mat 20:20} 那时，西庇太儿子的母亲同他两个儿子上前来拜耶稣，求他一件事。
{Mat 20:21} And he said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Say that these two sons of mine are to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom."
{Mat 20:21} 耶稣说：“你要什么呢？”他说：“愿你叫我这两个儿子在你国里，一个坐在你右边，一个坐在你左边。”
{Mat 20:22} Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?" They said to him, "We are able."
{Mat 20:22} 耶稣回答说：“你们不知道所求的是什么；我将要喝的杯，你们能喝吗？”他们说：“我们能。”
{Mat 20:23} He said to them, "You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, /grxnt/[授权] but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
{Mat 20:23} 耶稣说：“我所喝的杯，你们必要喝；只是坐在我的左右，不是我可以赐的，乃是我父为谁预备的，就赐给谁。”
{Mat 20:24} And when the ten heard it, they were indignant /in'dignant/[愤慨] at the two brothers.
{Mat 20:24} 那十个门徒听见，就恼怒他们弟兄二人。
{Mat 20:25} But Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over [phr.v. 主导它上方] them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
{Mat 20:25} 耶稣叫了他们来，说：“你们知道外邦人有君王为主治理他们，有大臣操权管束他们。
{Mat 20:26} It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant,
{Mat 20:26} 只是在你们中间，不可这样；你们中间谁愿为大，就必作你们的用人；
{Mat 20:27} and whoever would be first among you must be your slave,
{Mat 20:27} 谁愿为首，就必作你们的仆人。
{Mat 20:28} even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom /rxnsCm/[赎金] for many."
{Mat 20:28} 正如人子来，不是要受人的服事，乃是要服事人，并且要舍命，作多人的赎价。”
{Mat 20:29} And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
{Mat 20:29} 他们出耶利哥的时候，有极多的人跟随他。
{Mat 20:30} And behold, there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
{Mat 20:30} 有两个瞎子坐在路旁，听说是耶稣经过，就喊着说：“主啊，大卫的子孙，可怜我们吧！”
{Mat 20:31} The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
{Mat 20:31} 众人责备他们，不许他们作声；他们却越发喊着说：“主啊，大卫的子孙，可怜我们吧！”
{Mat 20:32} And stopping, Jesus called them and said, "What do you want me to do for you?"
{Mat 20:32} 耶稣就站住，叫他们来，说：“要我为你们做什么？”
{Mat 20:33} They said to him, "Lord, let our eyes be opened."
{Mat 20:33} 他们说：“主啊，要我们的眼睛能看见！”
{Mat 20:34} And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight and followed him.
{Mat 20:34} 耶稣就动了慈心，把他们的眼睛一摸，他们立刻看见，就跟从了耶稣。
{Mat 21:1}  Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, /beth'fadZ/ to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
{Mat 21:1}  耶稣和门徒将近耶路撒冷，到了伯法其，在橄榄山那里。
{Mat 21:2}  saying to them, "Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.
{Mat 21:2}  耶稣就打发两个门徒，对他们说：“你们往对面村子里去，必看见一匹驴拴在那里，还有驴驹同在一处；你们解开，牵到我这里来。
{Mat 21:3}  If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and he will send them at once."
{Mat 21:3}  若有人对你们说什么，你们就说：‘主要用他。’那人必立时让你们牵来。
{Mat 21:4}  This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,
{Mat 21:4}  这事成就是要应验先知的话，说：
{Mat 21:5}  "Say to the daughter of Zion, /zICn/ 'Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal /fOl/[驹] of a beast /bEst/[畜生] of burden.'"
{Mat 21:5}  要对锡安的居民（原文作女子）说：看哪，你的王来到你这里，是温柔的，又骑着驴，就是骑着驴驹子。”
{Mat 21:6}  The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
{Mat 21:6}  门徒就照耶稣所吩咐的去行，
{Mat 21:7}  They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them.
{Mat 21:7}  牵了驴和驴驹来，把自己的衣服搭在上面，耶稣就骑上。
{Mat 21:8}  Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
{Mat 21:8}  众人多半把衣服铺在路上；还有人砍下树枝来铺在路上。
{Mat 21:9}  And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, "Hosanna /hO'zxnna/ to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
{Mat 21:9}  前行后随的众人喊着说：和散那（原有求救的意思，在此是称颂的话）归于大卫的子孙！奉主名来的是应当称颂的！高高在上和散那！”
{Mat 21:10} And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, "Who is this?"
{Mat 21:10} 耶稣既进了耶路撒冷，合城都惊动了，说：“这是谁？”
{Mat 21:11} And the crowds said, "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee."
{Mat 21:11} 众人说：“这是加利利拿撒勒的先知耶稣。”
{Mat 21:12} And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought /bot/ in the temple, and he overturned [翻倒] the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons.
{Mat 21:12} 耶稣进了神的殿，赶出殿里一切做买卖的人，推倒兑换银钱之人的桌子，和卖鸽子之人的凳子；
{Mat 21:13} He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' /prAr/[祈祷者] but you make it a den [兽穴] of robbers."
{Mat 21:13} 对他们说：“经上记着说：我的殿必称为祷告的殿，你们倒使他成为贼窝了。”
{Mat 21:14} And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
{Mat 21:14} 在殿里有瞎子、瘸子到耶稣跟前，他就治好了他们。
{Mat 21:15} But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant,
{Mat 21:15} 祭司长和文士看见耶稣所行的奇事，又见小孩子在殿里喊着说：“和散那归于大卫的子孙！”就甚恼怒，
{Mat 21:16} and they said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes; have you never read, "'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?"
{Mat 21:16} 对他说：“这些人所说的，你听见了吗？”耶稣说：“是的。经上说‘你从婴孩和吃奶的口中完全了赞美’的话，你们没有念过吗？”
{Mat 21:17} And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged /lodZ/[寄宿] there.
{Mat 21:17} 于是离开他们，出城到伯大尼去，在那里住宿。
{Mat 21:18} In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry.
{Mat 21:18} 早晨回城的时候，他饿了，
{Mat 21:19} And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, "May no fruit ever come from you again!" And the fig tree withered at once.
{Mat 21:19} 看见路旁有一棵无花果树，就走到跟前，在树上找不着什么，不过有叶子，就对树说：“从今以后，你永不结果子。”那无花果树就立刻枯干了。
{Mat 21:20} When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree wither at once?"
{Mat 21:20} 门徒看见了，便希奇说：“无花果树怎么立刻枯干了呢？”
{Mat 21:21} And Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen.
{Mat 21:21} 耶稣回答说：“我实在告诉你们，你们若有信心，不疑惑，不但能行无花果树上所行的事，就是对这座山说：‘你挪开此地，投在海里！’也必成就。
{Mat 21:22} And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith."
{Mat 21:22} 你们祷告，无论求什么，只要信，就必得着。”
{Mat 21:23} And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"
{Mat 21:23} 耶稣进了殿，正教训人的时候，祭司长和民间的长老来问他说：“你仗着什么权柄做这些事？给你这权柄的是谁呢？”
{Mat 21:24} Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.
{Mat 21:24} 耶稣回答说：“我也要问你们一句话，你们若告诉我，我就告诉你们我仗着什么权柄做这些事。
{Mat 21:25} The baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man?" And they discussed it among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
{Mat 21:25} 约翰的洗礼是从那里来的？是从天上来的？是从人间来的呢？”他们彼此商议说：“我们若说‘从天上来，’他必对我们说：‘这样，你们为什么不信他呢？’
{Mat 21:26} But if we say, 'From man,' we are afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was a prophet."
{Mat 21:26} 若说‘从人间来’，我们又怕百姓，因为他们都以约翰为先知。”
{Mat 21:27} So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
{Mat 21:27} 于是回答耶稣说：“我们不知道。”耶稣说：“我也不告诉你们我仗着什么权柄做这些事。”
{Mat 21:28} "What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'
{Mat 21:28} 又说：“一个人有两个儿子。他来对大儿子说：‘我儿，你今天到葡萄园里去做工。’
{Mat 21:29} And he answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind and went.
{Mat 21:29} 他回答说：‘我不去’，以后自己懊悔，就去了。
{Mat 21:30} And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, 'I go, sir,' but did not go.
{Mat 21:30} 又来对小儿子也是这样说。他回答说：‘父啊，我去’，他却不去。
{Mat 21:31} Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes /prostitut/[娼妓 < 放在前面当出售品] go into the kingdom of God before you.
{Mat 21:31} 你们想，这两个儿子是那一个遵行父命呢？”他们说：“大儿子。”耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们，税吏和娼妓倒比你们先进神的国。
{Mat 21:32} For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.
{Mat 21:32} 因为约翰遵着义路到你们这里来，你们却不信他；税吏和娼妓倒信他。你们看见了，后来还是不懊悔去信他。”
{Mat 21:33} "Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence [栅栏] around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased /lEs/[出租] it to tenants, and went into another country.
{Mat 21:33} “你们再听一个比喻：有个家主栽了一个葡萄园，周围圈上篱笆，里面挖了一个压酒池，盖了一座楼，租给园户，就往外国去了。
{Mat 21:34} When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit.
{Mat 21:34} 收果子的时候近了，就打发仆人到园户那里去收果子。
{Mat 21:35} And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.
{Mat 21:35} 园户拿住仆人，打了一个，杀了一个，用石头打死一个。
{Mat 21:36} Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them.
{Mat 21:36} 主人又打发别的仆人去，比先前更多；园户还是照样待他们。
{Mat 21:37} Finally he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
{Mat 21:37} 后来打发他的儿子到他们那里去，意思说：‘他们必尊敬我的儿子。’
{Mat 21:38} But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir. /Ar/[继承者] Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.'
{Mat 21:38} 不料，园户看见他儿子，就彼此说：（这是承受产业的。来吧，我们杀他，占他的产业！’
{Mat 21:39} And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
{Mat 21:39} 他们就拿住他，推出葡萄园外，杀了。
{Mat 21:40} When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?"
{Mat 21:40} 园主来的时候要怎样处治这些园户呢？”
{Mat 21:41} They said to him, "He will put those wretches /retS/[卑鄙者] to a miserable /mizcrabl/[悲惨的] death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons."
{Mat 21:41} 他们说：“要下毒手除灭那些恶人，将葡萄园另租给那按着时候交果子的园户。”
{Mat 21:42} Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: "'The stone that the builders rejected /rE'dZekt/[拒绝、抵制、驳回] has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous /marvelCs/ in our eyes'?
{Mat 21:42} 耶稣说：“经上写着：匠人所弃的石头已作了房角的头块石头。这是主所做的，在我们眼中看为希奇。这经你们没有念过吗？
{Mat 21:43} Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits.
{Mat 21:43} 所以我告诉你们，神的国必从你们夺去，赐给那能结果子的百姓。
{Mat 21:44} And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him."
{Mat 21:44} 谁掉在这石头上，必要跌碎；这石头掉在谁的身上，就要把谁砸得稀烂。”
{Mat 21:45} When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them.
{Mat 21:45} 祭司长和法利赛人听见他的比喻，就看出他是指着他们说的。
{Mat 21:46} And although /al'dhO/ they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet.
{Mat 21:46} 他们想要捉拿他，只是怕众人，因为众人以他为先知。
{Mat 22:1}  And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying,
{Mat 22:1}  耶稣又用比喻对他们说：
{Mat 22:2}  "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son,
{Mat 22:2}  “天国好比一个王为他儿子摆设娶亲的筵席，
{Mat 22:3}  and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.
{Mat 22:3}  就打发仆人去，请那些被召的人来赴席，他们却不肯来。
{Mat 22:4}  Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen /oksen/ and my fat calves /kxf/[小牛] have been slaughtered, /slotcr/[屠杀] and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast."'
{Mat 22:4}  王又打发别的仆人，说：‘你们告诉那被召的人，我的筵席已经预备好了，牛和肥畜已经宰了，各样都齐备，请你们来赴席。’
{Mat 22:5}  But they paid no attention /a'tenSCn/[注意力] and went off, one to his farm, another to his business,
{Mat 22:5}  那些人不理就走了；一个到自己田里去；一个做买卖去；
{Mat 22:6}  while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.
{Mat 22:6}  其余的拿住仆人，凌辱他们，把他们杀了。
{Mat 22:7}  The king was angry, and he sent his troops /trwp/[成群军队] and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
{Mat 22:7}  王就大怒，发兵除灭那些凶手，烧毁他们的城。
{Mat 22:8}  Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.
{Mat 22:8}  于是对仆人说：‘喜筵已经齐备，只是所召的人不配。
{Mat 22:9}  Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.'
{Mat 22:9}  所以你们要往岔路口上去，凡遇见的，都召来赴席。’
{Mat 22:10} And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall /hal/[大厅] was filled with guests.
{Mat 22:10} 那些仆人就出去，到大路上，凡遇见的，不论善恶都召聚了来，筵席上就坐满了客。
{Mat 22:11} "But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment.
{Mat 22:11} 王进来观看宾客，见那里有一个没有穿礼服的，
{Mat 22:12} And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. /spEtSles/[无话说]
{Mat 22:12} 就对他说：‘朋友，你到这里来怎么不穿礼服呢？’那人无言可答。
{Mat 22:13} Then the king said to the attendants, /a'tend/[随入] 'Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
{Mat 22:13} 于是王对使唤的人说：‘捆起他的手脚来，把他丢在外边的黑暗里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。’
{Mat 22:14} For many are called, but few are chosen."
{Mat 22:14} 因为被召的人多，选上的人少。”
{Mat 22:15} Then the Pharisees went and plotted /plot/[密谋] how to entangle /en'txngl/[纠缠] him in his words.
{Mat 22:15} 当时，法利赛人出去商议，怎样就着耶稣的话陷害他，
{Mat 22:16} And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are true /tru/ and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, /C'piniCn/[主张意见] for you are not swayed /swA/[摇摆] by appearances.
{Mat 22:16} 就打发他们的门徒同希律党的人去见耶稣，说：“夫子，我们知道你是诚实人，并且诚诚实实传神的道，什么人你都不徇情面，因为你不看人的外貌。
{Mat 22:17} Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
{Mat 22:17} 请告诉我们，你的意见如何？纳税给该撒可以不可以？”
{Mat 22:18} But Jesus, aware of their malice, /mxlis/[恶意] said, "Why put me to the test, you hypocrites?
{Mat 22:18} 耶稣看出他们的恶意，就说：“假冒为善的人哪，为什么试探我？
{Mat 22:19} Show me the coin for the tax." And they brought him a denarius.
{Mat 22:19} 拿一个上税的钱给我看！”他们就拿一个银钱来给他。
{Mat 22:20} And Jesus said to them, "Whose likeness [样像] and inscription is this?"
{Mat 22:20} 耶稣说：“这像和这号是谁的？”
{Mat 22:21} They said, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
{Mat 22:21} 他们说：“是该撒的。”耶稣说：“这样，该撒的物当归给该撒；神的物当归给神。”
{Mat 22:22} When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away.
{Mat 22:22} 他们听见就希奇，离开他走了。
{Mat 22:23} The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question,
{Mat 22:23} 撒都该人常说没有复活的事。那天，他们来问耶稣说：
{Mat 22:24} saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.'
{Mat 22:24} “夫子，摩西说：‘人若死了，没有孩子，他兄弟当娶他的妻，为哥哥生子立后。’
{Mat 22:25} Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother.
{Mat 22:25} 从前，在我们这里有弟兄七人，第一个娶了妻，死了，没有孩子，撇下妻子给兄弟。
{Mat 22:26} So too the second and third, down to the seventh.
{Mat 22:26} 第二、第三、直到第七个，都是如此。
{Mat 22:27} After them all, the woman died.
{Mat 22:27} 末后，妇人也死了。
{Mat 22:28} In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her."
{Mat 22:28} 这样，当复活的时候，他是七个人中那一个的妻子呢？因为他们都娶过他。”
{Mat 22:29} But Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.
{Mat 22:29} 耶稣回答说：“你们错了；因为不明白圣经，也不晓得神的大能。
{Mat 22:30} For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
{Mat 22:30} 当复活的时候，人也不娶也不嫁，乃像天上的使者一样。
{Mat 22:31} And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God:
{Mat 22:31} 论到死人复活，神在经上向你们所说的，你们没有念过吗？
{Mat 22:32} 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living."
{Mat 22:32} 他说：‘我是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。’神不是死人的神，乃是活人的神。”
{Mat 22:33} And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
{Mat 22:33} 众人听见这话，就希奇他的教训。
{Mat 22:34} But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
{Mat 22:34} 法利赛人听见耶稣堵住了撒都该人的口，他们就聚集。
{Mat 22:35} And one of them, a lawyer, /loycr/ asked him a question to test him.
{Mat 22:35} 内中有一个人是律法师，要试探耶稣，就问他说：
{Mat 22:36} "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"
{Mat 22:36} “夫子，律法上的诫命，那一条是最大的呢？”
{Mat 22:37} And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
{Mat 22:37} 耶稣对他说：“你要尽心、尽性、尽意爱主你的神。
{Mat 22:38} This is the great and first commandment.
{Mat 22:38} 这是诫命中的第一，且是最大的。
{Mat 22:39} And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
{Mat 22:39} 其次也相仿，就是要爱人如己。
{Mat 22:40} On these two commandments depend /dE'pend/[依赖 < 悬挂在] all the Law and the Prophets."
{Mat 22:40} 这两条诫命是律法和先知一切道理的总纲。”
{Mat 22:41} Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
{Mat 22:41} 法利赛人聚集的时候，耶稣问他们说：
{Mat 22:42} saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David."
{Mat 22:42} “论到基督，你们的意见如何？他是谁的子孙呢？”他们回答说：“是大卫的子孙。”
{Mat 22:43} He said to them, "How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,
{Mat 22:43} 耶稣说：“这样，大卫被圣灵感动，怎么还称他为主，说：
{Mat 22:44} "'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet"'?
{Mat 22:44} 主对我主说：你坐在我的右边，等我把你仇敌放在你的脚下。
{Mat 22:45} If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
{Mat 22:45} 大卫既称他为主，他怎么又是大卫的子孙呢？”
{Mat 22:46} And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.
{Mat 22:46} 他们没有一个人能回答一言。从那日以后，也没有人敢再问他什么。
{Mat 23:1}  Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,
{Mat 23:1}  那时，耶稣对众人和门徒讲论，
{Mat 23:2}  "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat,
{Mat 23:2}  说：“文士和法利赛人坐在摩西的位上，
{Mat 23:3}  so do and observe /Cb'zcrv/[观测] whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice. /prxktis/[实行]
{Mat 23:3}  凡他们所吩咐你们的，你们都要谨守遵行；但不要效法他们的行为；因为他们能说，不能行。
{Mat 23:4}  They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger.
{Mat 23:4}  他们把难担的重担捆起来，搁在人的肩上，但自己一个指头也不肯动。
{Mat 23:5}  They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries /fi'lxktcry/[经文匣] broad /brod/[宽广的] and their fringes long,
{Mat 23:5}  他们一切所做的事都是要叫人看见，所以将佩戴的经文做宽了，衣裳的䍁子做长了，
{Mat 23:6}  and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues
{Mat 23:6}  喜爱筵席上的首座，会堂里的高位，
{Mat 23:7}  and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi /rxbI/ by others.
{Mat 23:7}  又喜爱人在街市上问他安，称呼他拉比（拉比就是夫子）。
{Mat 23:8}  But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers.
{Mat 23:8}  但你们不要受拉比的称呼，因为只有一位是你们的夫子；你们都是弟兄。
{Mat 23:9}  And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
{Mat 23:9}  也不要称呼地上的人为父，因为只有一位是你们的父，就是在天上的父。
{Mat 23:10} Neither be called instructors, /in'strCktcr/[教导者] for you have one instructor, the Christ.
{Mat 23:10} 也不要受师尊的称呼，因为只有一位是你们的师尊，就是基督。
{Mat 23:11} The greatest among you shall be your servant.
{Mat 23:11} 你们中间谁为大，谁就要作你们的用人。
{Mat 23:12} Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
{Mat 23:12} 凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。
{Mat 23:13} "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
{Mat 23:13} “你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们正当人前，把天国的门关了，自己不进去，正要进去的人，你们也不容他们进去。（有古卷在此有
{Mat 23:14} Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation.
{Mat 23:14} 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们侵吞寡妇的家产，假意做很长的祷告，所以要受更重的刑罚。）
{Mat 23:15} Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel /trxvel/[游历] across sea and land to make a single proselyte, /proselIt/[改变宗教信仰者] and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
{Mat 23:15} “你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们走遍洋海陆地，勾引一个人入教，既入了教，却使他作地狱之子，比你们还加倍。
{Mat 23:16} "Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.'
{Mat 23:16} “你们这瞎眼领路的有祸了！你们说：‘凡指着殿起誓的，这算不得什么；只是凡指着殿中金子起誓的，他就该谨守。’
{Mat 23:17} You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? /sAcred/[神圣的]
{Mat 23:17} 你们这无知瞎眼的人哪，什么是大的？是金子呢？还是叫金子成圣的殿呢？
{Mat 23:18} And you say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.'
{Mat 23:18} 你们又说：‘凡指着坛起誓的，这算不得什么；只是凡指着坛上礼物起誓的，他就该谨守。’
{Mat 23:19} You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
{Mat 23:19} 你们这瞎眼的人哪，什么是大的？是礼物呢？还是叫礼物成圣的坛呢？
{Mat 23:20} So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
{Mat 23:20} 所以，人指着坛起誓，就是指着坛和坛上一切所有的起誓；
{Mat 23:21} And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it.
{Mat 23:21} 人指着殿起誓，就是指着殿和那住在殿里的起誓；
{Mat 23:22} And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.
{Mat 23:22} 人指着天起誓，就是指着神的宝座和那坐在上面的起誓。
{Mat 23:23} "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe /tIdh/[十一奉献] mint [薄荷] and dill [洋茴香] and cumin, /kUmin/[莳萝] and have neglected /nE'glekt/[忽视 < 没有捡起] the weightier /wAt/[重量] matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
{Mat 23:23} “你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们将薄荷、茴香、芹菜，献上十分之一，那律法上更重的事，就是公义、怜悯、信实，反倒不行了。这更重的是你们当行的；那也是不可不行的。
{Mat 23:24} You blind guides, straining /strAn/[接紧] out a gnat /nxt/ and swallowing /swallO/[吞下] a camel!
{Mat 23:24} 你们这瞎眼领路的，蠓虫你们就滤出来，骆驼你们倒吞下去。
{Mat 23:25} "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed /grEd/[贪心] and self-indulgence. /in'dcldZ/[放任]
{Mat 23:25} “你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们洗净杯盘的外面，里面却盛满了勒索和放荡。
{Mat 23:26} You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean.
{Mat 23:26} 你这瞎眼的法利赛人，先洗净杯盘的里面，好叫外面也干净了。
{Mat 23:27} "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, /twm/ which outwardly [外表地] appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.
{Mat 23:27} “你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们好像粉饰的坟墓，外面好看，里面却装满了死人的骨头和一切的污秽。
{Mat 23:28} So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy /hi'pokrisy/ and lawlessness.
{Mat 23:28} 你们也是如此，在人前，外面显出公义来，里面却装满了假善和不法的事。
{Mat 23:29} "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate /dekOrAt/[修饰] the monuments /monUment/[纪念物] of the righteous,
{Mat 23:29} “你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们建造先知的坟，修饰义人的墓，说：
{Mat 23:30} saying, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding /Sed/[流出] the blood of the prophets.'
{Mat 23:30} ‘若是我们在我们祖宗的时候，必不和他们同流先知的血。’
{Mat 23:31} Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.
{Mat 23:31} 这就是你们自己证明是杀害先知者的子孙了。
{Mat 23:32} Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.
{Mat 23:32} 你们去充满你们祖宗的恶贯吧！
{Mat 23:33} You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape /es'kAp/[逃脱] being sentenced [判刑 < 划上句号] to hell?
{Mat 23:33} 你们这些蛇类、毒蛇之种啊，怎能逃脱地狱的刑罚呢？
{Mat 23:34} Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town,
{Mat 23:34} 所以我差遣先知和智慧人并文士到你们这里来，有的你们要杀害，要钉十字架；有的你们要在会堂里鞭打，从这城追逼到那城，
{Mat 23:35} so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, /bxra'kIa/ whom you murdered between the sanctuary /sxnktSUary/[圣所] and the altar.
{Mat 23:35} 叫世上所流义人的血都归到你们身上，从义人亚伯的血起，直到你们在殿和坛中间所杀的巴拉加的儿子撒迦利亚的血为止。
{Mat 23:36} Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.
{Mat 23:36} 我实在告诉你们，这一切的罪都要归到这世代了。”
{Mat 23:37} "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!
{Mat 23:37} “耶路撒冷啊，耶路撒冷啊，你常杀害先知，又用石头打死那奉差遣到你这里来的人。我多次愿意聚集你的儿女，好像母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下，只是你们不愿意。
{Mat 23:38} See, your house is left to you desolate.
{Mat 23:38} 看哪，你们的家成为荒场留给你们。
{Mat 23:39} For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"
{Mat 23:39} 我告诉你们，从今以后，你们不得再见我，直等到你们说：‘奉主名来的是应当称颂的。’”
{Mat 24:1}  Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
{Mat 24:1}  耶稣出了圣殿，正走的时候，门徒进前来，把殿宇指给他看。
{Mat 24:2}  But he answered them, "You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down."
{Mat 24:2}  耶稣对他们说：“你们不是看见这殿宇吗？我实在告诉你们，将来在这里没有一块石头留在石头上，不被拆毁了。”
{Mat 24:3}  As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
{Mat 24:3}  耶稣在橄榄山上坐着，门徒暗暗的来说：“请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事？你降临和世界的末了有什么预兆呢？”
{Mat 24:4}  And Jesus answered them, "See that no one leads you astray.
{Mat 24:4}  耶稣回答说：“你们要谨慎，免得有人迷惑你们。
{Mat 24:5}  For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray.
{Mat 24:5}  因为将来有好些人冒我的名来，说：‘我是基督’，并且要迷惑许多人。
{Mat 24:6}  And you will hear of wars and rumors /rumcr/[风声] of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet.
{Mat 24:6}  你们也要听见打仗和打仗的风声，总不要惊慌；因为这些事是必须有的，只是末期还没有到。
{Mat 24:7}  For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
{Mat 24:7}  民要攻打民，国要攻打国；多处必有饥荒、地震。
{Mat 24:8}  All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.
{Mat 24:8}  这都是灾难（灾难：原文作生产之难）的起头。
{Mat 24:9}  "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation [患难] and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
{Mat 24:9}  那时，人要把你们陷在患难里，也要杀害你们；你们又要为我的名被万民恨恶。
{Mat 24:10} And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another.
{Mat 24:10} 那时，必有许多人跌倒，也要彼此陷害，彼此恨恶；
{Mat 24:11} And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
{Mat 24:11} 且有好些假先知起来，迷惑多人。
{Mat 24:12} And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold.
{Mat 24:12} 只因不法的事增多，许多人的爱心才渐渐冷淡了。
{Mat 24:13} But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
{Mat 24:13} 惟有忍耐到底的，必然得救。
{Mat 24:14} And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
{Mat 24:14} 这天国的福音要传遍天下，对万民作见证，然后末期才来到。”
{Mat 24:15} "So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
{Mat 24:15} “你们看见先知但以理所说的‘那行毁坏可憎的’站在圣地（读这经的人须要会意）。
{Mat 24:16} then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
{Mat 24:16} 那时，在犹太的，应当逃到山上；
{Mat 24:17} Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house,
{Mat 24:17} 在房上的，不要下来拿家里的东西；
{Mat 24:18} and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.
{Mat 24:18} 在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳。
{Mat 24:19} And alas /a'lxs/ for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days!
{Mat 24:19} 当那些日子，怀孕的和奶孩子的有祸了。
{Mat 24:20} Pray that your flight [飞行、逃走] may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
{Mat 24:20} 你们应当祈求，叫你们逃走的时候，不遇见冬天或是安息日。
{Mat 24:21} For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.
{Mat 24:21} 因为那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难，后来也必没有。
{Mat 24:22} And if those days had not been cut short, no human being [存在之人] would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.
{Mat 24:22} 若不减少那日子，凡有血气的总没有一个得救的；只是为选民，那日子必减少了。
{Mat 24:23} Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it.
{Mat 24:23} 那时，若有人对你们说：‘基督在这里’，或说：‘基督在那里’，你们不要信！
{Mat 24:24} For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
{Mat 24:24} 因为假基督、假先知将要起来，显大神迹、大奇事，倘若能行，连选民也就迷惑了。
{Mat 24:25} See, I have told you beforehand.
{Mat 24:25} 看哪，我预先告诉你们了。
{Mat 24:26} So, if they say to you, 'Look, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out. If they say, 'Look, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
{Mat 24:26} 若有人对你们说：‘看哪，基督在旷野里’，你们不要出去！或说：‘看哪，基督在内屋中’，你们不要信！
{Mat 24:27} For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
{Mat 24:27} 闪电从东边发出，直照到西边。人子降临，也要这样。
{Mat 24:28} Wherever the corpse /korps/[尸体] is, there the vultures /vcltScr/[秃鹰] will gather.
{Mat 24:28} 尸首在那里，鹰也必聚在那里。”
{Mat 24:29} "Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
{Mat 24:29} “那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落，天势都要震动。
{Mat 24:30} Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes /trIb/[部族] of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
{Mat 24:30} 那时，人子的兆头要显在天上，地上的万族都要哀哭。他们要看见人子，有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临。
{Mat 24:31} And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
{Mat 24:31} 他要差遣使者，用号筒的大声，将他的选民，从四方（方：原文作风），从天这边到天那边，都招聚了来。”
{Mat 24:32} "From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender [娇嫩] and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.
{Mat 24:32} “你们可以从无花果树学个比方：当树枝发嫩长叶的时候，你们就知道夏天近了。
{Mat 24:33} So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates.
{Mat 24:33} 这样，你们看见这一切的事，也该知道人子近了，正在门口了。
{Mat 24:34} Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
{Mat 24:34} 我实在告诉你们，这世代还没有过去，这些事都要成就。
{Mat 24:35} Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
{Mat 24:35} 天地要废去，我的话却不能废去。”
{Mat 24:36} "But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.
{Mat 24:36} “那日子，那时辰，没有人知道，连天上的使者也不知道，子也不知道，惟独父知道。
{Mat 24:37} For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
{Mat 24:37} 挪亚的日子怎样，人子降临也要怎样。
{Mat 24:38} For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark,
{Mat 24:38} 当洪水以前的日子，人照常吃喝嫁娶，直到挪亚进方舟的那日；
{Mat 24:39} and they were unaware /cna'wAr/[没有察觉] until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
{Mat 24:39} 不知不觉洪水来了，把他们全都冲去。人子降临也要这样。
{Mat 24:40} Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left.
{Mat 24:40} 那时，两个人在田里，取去一个，撇下一个。
{Mat 24:41} Two women will be grinding at the mill; [磨坊] one will be taken and one left.
{Mat 24:41} 两个女人推磨，取去一个，撇下一个。
{Mat 24:42} Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.
{Mat 24:42} 所以，你们要警醒，因为不知道你们的主是那一天来到。
{Mat 24:43} But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief /thEf/[小偷] was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.
{Mat 24:43} 家主若知道几更天有贼来，就必警醒，不容人挖透房屋；这是你们所知道的。
{Mat 24:44} Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. /ek'spekt/
{Mat 24:44} 所以，你们也要预备，因为你们想不到的时候，人子就来了。”
{Mat 24:45} "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper /propcr/[专属的] time?
{Mat 24:45} “谁是忠心有见识的仆人，为主人所派，管理家里的人，按时分粮给他们呢？
{Mat 24:46} Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.
{Mat 24:46} 主人来到，看见他这样行，那仆人就有福了。
{Mat 24:47} Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.
{Mat 24:47} 我实在告诉你们，主人要派他管理一切所有的。
{Mat 24:48} But if that wicked servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed,' /dE'lA/
{Mat 24:48} 倘若那恶仆心里说：‘我的主人必来得迟’，
{Mat 24:49} and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards,
{Mat 24:49} 就动手打他的同伴，又和酒醉的人一同吃喝。
{Mat 24:50} the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know
{Mat 24:50} 在想不到的日子，不知道的时辰，那仆人的主人要来，
{Mat 24:51} and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
{Mat 24:51} 重重的处治他（或作：把他腰斩了），定他和假冒为善的人同罪；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。”
{Mat 25:1}  "Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins /vcrdZin/[童贞] who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
{Mat 25:1}  “那时，天国好比十个童女拿着灯出去迎接新郎。
{Mat 25:2}  Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
{Mat 25:2}  其中有五个是愚拙的，五个是聪明的。
{Mat 25:3}  For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them,
{Mat 25:3}  愚拙的拿着灯，却不预备油；
{Mat 25:4}  but the wise took flasks /flxsk/[细瓶] of oil with their lamps.
{Mat 25:4}  聪明的拿着灯，又预备油在器皿里。
{Mat 25:5}  As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy /drauzy/[瞌睡] and slept.
{Mat 25:5}  新郎迟延的时候，他们都打盹，睡着了。
{Mat 25:6}  But at midnight there was a cry, 'Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.'
{Mat 25:6}  半夜有人喊着说：‘新郎来了，你们出来迎接他！’
{Mat 25:7}  Then all those virgins rose and trimmed /trim/[收拾收拾] their lamps.
{Mat 25:7}  那些童女就都起来收拾灯。
{Mat 25:8}  And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
{Mat 25:8}  愚拙的对聪明的说：‘请分点油给我们，因为我们的灯要灭了。’
{Mat 25:9}  But the wise answered, saying, 'Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers /dElcr/[商人] and buy for yourselves.'
{Mat 25:9}  聪明的回答说：‘恐怕不够你我用的；不如你们自己到卖油的那里去买吧。’
{Mat 25:10} And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
{Mat 25:10} 他们去买的时候，新郎到了。那预备好了的，同他进去坐席，门就关了。
{Mat 25:11} Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, lord, open to us.'
{Mat 25:11} 其余的童女随后也来了，说：‘主啊，主啊，给我们开门！’
{Mat 25:12} But he answered, 'Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.'
{Mat 25:12} 他却回答说：‘我实在告诉你们，我不认识你们。’
{Mat 25:13} Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.
{Mat 25:13} 所以，你们要警醒；因为那日子，那时辰，你们不知道。”
{Mat 25:14} "For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. [财产]
{Mat 25:14} “天国又好比一个人要往外国去，就叫了仆人来，把他的家业交给他们，
{Mat 25:15} To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. /a'bility/[能力] Then he went away.
{Mat 25:15} 按着各人的才干给他们银子：一个给了五千，一个给了二千，一个给了一千，就往外国去了。
{Mat 25:16} He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more.
{Mat 25:16} 那领五千的随即拿去做买卖，另外赚了五千。
{Mat 25:17} So also he who had the two talents made two talents more.
{Mat 25:17} 那领二千的也照样另赚了二千。
{Mat 25:18} But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.
{Mat 25:18} 但那领一千的去掘开地，把主人的银子埋藏了。
{Mat 25:19} Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled [安顿] accounts with them.
{Mat 25:19} 过了许久，那些仆人的主人来了，和他们算账。
{Mat 25:20} And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.'
{Mat 25:20} 那领五千银子的又带着那另外的五千来，说：‘主啊，你交给我五千银子。请看，我又赚了五千。’
{Mat 25:21} His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.'
{Mat 25:21} 主人说：‘好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，你在不多的事上有忠心，我要把许多事派你管理；可以进来享受你主人的快乐。’
{Mat 25:22} And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.'
{Mat 25:22} 那领二千的也来，说：‘主啊，你交给我二千银子。请看，我又赚了二千。’
{Mat 25:23} His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.'
{Mat 25:23} 主人说：‘好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，你在不多的事上有忠心，我要把许多事派你管理；可以进来享受你主人的快乐。’
{Mat 25:24} He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed,
{Mat 25:24} 那领一千的也来，说：‘主啊，我知道你是忍心的人，没有种的地方要收割，没有散的地方要聚敛，
{Mat 25:25} so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.'
{Mat 25:25} 我就害怕，去把你的一千银子埋藏在地里。请看，你的原银子在这里。’
{Mat 25:26} But his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful /sloth/[懒惰 < slow] servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed?
{Mat 25:26} 主人回答说：‘你这又恶又懒的仆人，你既知道我没有种的地方要收割，没有散的地方要聚敛，
{Mat 25:27} Then you ought to have invested /in'vest/[投资] my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. /in'trest/[兴趣、利息 < 存在中间有关系的]
{Mat 25:27} 就当把我的银子放给兑换银钱的人，到我来的时候，可以连本带利收回。
{Mat 25:28} So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.
{Mat 25:28} 夺过他这一千来，给那有一万的。
{Mat 25:29} For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
{Mat 25:29} 因为凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有余；没有的，连他所有的也要夺过来。
{Mat 25:30} And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
{Mat 25:30} 把这无用的仆人丢在外面黑暗里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。’”
{Mat 25:31} "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.
{Mat 25:31} “当人子在他荣耀里，同着众天使降临的时候，要坐在他荣耀的宝座上。
{Mat 25:32} Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
{Mat 25:32} 万民都要聚集在他面前。他要把他们分别出来，好像牧羊的分别绵羊山羊一般，
{Mat 25:33} And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.
{Mat 25:33} 把绵羊安置在右边，山羊在左边。
{Mat 25:34} Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
{Mat 25:34} 于是王要向那右边的说：‘你们这蒙我父赐福的，可来承受那创世以来为你们所预备的国；
{Mat 25:35} For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me,
{Mat 25:35} 因为我饿了，你们给我吃，渴了，你们给我喝；我作客旅，你们留我住；
{Mat 25:36} I was naked /nAked/[裸体] and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.'
{Mat 25:36} 我赤身露体，你们给我穿；我病了、你们看顾我；我在监里，你们来看我。’
{Mat 25:37} Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?
{Mat 25:37} 义人就回答说：‘主啊，我们什么时候见你饿了，给你吃，渴了，给你喝？
{Mat 25:38} And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?
{Mat 25:38} 什么时候见你作客旅，留你住，或是赤身露体，给你穿？
{Mat 25:39} And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?'
{Mat 25:39} 又什么时候见你病了，或是在监里，来看你呢？’
{Mat 25:40} And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'
{Mat 25:40} 王要回答说：‘我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既做在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是做在我身上了。’
{Mat 25:41} "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
{Mat 25:41} 王又要向那左边的说：‘你们这被咒诅的人，离开我！进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去！
{Mat 25:42} For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,
{Mat 25:42} 因为我饿了，你们不给我吃，渴了，你们不给我喝；
{Mat 25:43} I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.'
{Mat 25:43} 我作客旅，你们不留我住；我赤身露体，你们不给我穿；我病了，我在监里，你们不来看顾我。’
{Mat 25:44} Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?'
{Mat 25:44} 他们也要回答说：‘主啊，我们什么时候见你饿了，或渴了，或作客旅，或赤身露体，或病了，或在监里，不伺候你呢？’
{Mat 25:45} Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.'
{Mat 25:45} 王要回答说：‘我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既不做在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是不做在我身上了。’
{Mat 25:46} And these will go away into eternal punishment, [惩罚] but the righteous into eternal life."
{Mat 25:46} 这些人要往永刑里去；那些义人要往永生里去。”
{Mat 26:1}  When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,
{Mat 26:1}  耶稣说完了这一切的话，就对门徒说：
{Mat 26:2}  "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
{Mat 26:2}  “你们知道，过两天是逾越节，人子将要被交给人，钉在十字架上。”
{Mat 26:3}  Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace /pxlas/[豪宅] of the high priest, whose /hus/ name was Caiaphas, /kAafas/
{Mat 26:3}  那时，祭司长和民间的长老聚集在大祭司称为该亚法的院里。
{Mat 26:4}  and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth /stelth/[偷偷] and kill him.
{Mat 26:4}  大家商议要用诡计拿住耶稣，杀他，
{Mat 26:5}  But they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people."
{Mat 26:5}  只是说：“当节的日子不可，恐怕民间生乱。”
{Mat 26:6}  Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
{Mat 26:6}  耶稣在伯大尼长大麻疯的西门家里，
{Mat 26:7}  a woman came up to him with an alabaster /xlabxstcr/ flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table.
{Mat 26:7}  有一个女人拿着一玉瓶极贵的香膏来，趁耶稣坐席的时候，浇在他的头上。
{Mat 26:8}  And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?
{Mat 26:8}  门徒看见就很不喜悦，说：“何用这样的枉费呢！
{Mat 26:9}  For this could have been sold for a large sum /sCm/[总额] and given to the poor."
{Mat 26:9}  这香膏可以卖许多钱，周济穷人。”
{Mat 26:10} But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me.
{Mat 26:10} 耶稣看出他们的意思，就说：“为什么难为这女人呢？他在我身上做的是一件美事。
{Mat 26:11} For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
{Mat 26:11} 因为常有穷人和你们同在；只是你们不常有我。
{Mat 26:12} In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial. [葬礼]
{Mat 26:12} 他将这香膏浇在我身上是为我安葬做的。
{Mat 26:13} Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."
{Mat 26:13} 我实在告诉你们，普天之下，无论在什么地方传这福音，也要述说这女人所行的，作个纪念。”
{Mat 26:14} Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
{Mat 26:14} 当下，十二门徒里有一个称为加略人犹大的，去见祭司长，说：
{Mat 26:15} and said, "What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
{Mat 26:15} “我把他交给你们，你们愿意给我多少钱？”他们就给了他三十块钱。
{Mat 26:16} And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.
{Mat 26:16} 从那时候，他就找机会要把耶稣交给他们。
{Mat 26:17} Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
{Mat 26:17} 除酵节的第一天，门徒来问耶稣说：“你吃逾越节的筵席，要我们在那里给你预备？”
{Mat 26:18} He said, "Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
{Mat 26:18} 耶稣说：“你们进城去，到某人那里，对他说：‘夫子说：我的时候快到了，我与门徒要在你家里守逾越节。’”
{Mat 26:19} And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
{Mat 26:19} 门徒遵着耶稣所吩咐的就去预备了逾越节的筵席。
{Mat 26:20} When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve.
{Mat 26:20} 到了晚上，耶稣和十二个门徒坐席。
{Mat 26:21} And as they were eating, he said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me."
{Mat 26:21} 正吃的时候，耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们，你们中间有一个人要卖我了。”
{Mat 26:22} And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, "Is it I, Lord?"
{Mat 26:22} 他们就甚忧愁，一个一个的问他说：“主，是我吗？”
{Mat 26:23} He answered, "He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me.
{Mat 26:23} 耶稣回答说：“同我蘸手在盘子里的，就是他要卖我。
{Mat 26:24} The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."
{Mat 26:24} 人子必要去世，正如经上指着他所写的；但卖人子的人有祸了！那人不生在世上倒好。”
{Mat 26:25} Judas, who would betray him, answered, "Is it I, Rabbi?" He said to him, "You have said so."
{Mat 26:25} 卖耶稣的犹大问他说：“拉比，是我吗？”耶稣说：“你说的是。”
{Mat 26:26} Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."
{Mat 26:26} 他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝福，就擘开，递给门徒，说：“你们拿着吃，这是我的身体”；
{Mat 26:27} And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, "Drink of it, all of you,
{Mat 26:27} 又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，说：“你们都喝这个；
{Mat 26:28} for this is my blood of the covenant, /kovenant/[盟约] which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
{Mat 26:28} 因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。
{Mat 26:29} I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
{Mat 26:29} 但我告诉你们，从今以后，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直到我在我父的国里同你们喝新的那日子。”
{Mat 26:30} And when they had sung a hymn, /him/ they went out to the Mount of Olives.
{Mat 26:30} 他们唱了诗，就出来往橄榄山去。
{Mat 26:31} Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock /flok/[羊群] will be scattered.'
{Mat 26:31} 那时，耶稣对他们说：“今夜，你们为我的缘故都要跌倒。因为经上记着说：我要击打牧人，羊就分散了。
{Mat 26:32} But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."
{Mat 26:32} 但我复活以后，要在你们以先往加利利去。”
{Mat 26:33} Peter answered him, "Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away."
{Mat 26:33} 彼得说：“众人虽然为你的缘故跌倒，我却永不跌倒。”
{Mat 26:34} Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
{Mat 26:34} 耶稣说：“我实在告诉你，今夜鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。”
{Mat 26:35} Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!" And all the disciples said the same.
{Mat 26:35} 彼得说：“我就是必须和你同死，也总不能不认你。”众门徒都是这样说。
{Mat 26:36} Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, /geth'semanE/ and he said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go over there and pray."
{Mat 26:36} 耶稣同门徒来到一个地方，名叫客西马尼，就对他们说：“你们坐在这里，等我到那边去祷告。”
{Mat 26:37} And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
{Mat 26:37} 于是带着彼得和西庇太的两个儿子同去，就忧愁起来，极其难过，
{Mat 26:38} Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me."
{Mat 26:38} 便对他们说：“我心里甚是忧伤，几乎要死；你们在这里等候，和我一同警醒。”
{Mat 26:39} And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
{Mat 26:39} 他就稍往前走，俯伏在地，祷告说：“我父啊，倘若可行，求你叫这杯离开我。然而，不要照我的意思，只要照你的意思。”
{Mat 26:40} And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me one hour?
{Mat 26:40} 来到门徒那里，见他们睡着了，就对彼得说：“怎么样？你们不能同我警醒片时吗？
{Mat 26:41} Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
{Mat 26:41} 总要警醒祷告，免得入了迷惑。你们心灵固然愿意，肉体却软弱了。”
{Mat 26:42} Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done."
{Mat 26:42} 第二次又去祷告说：“我父啊，这杯若不能离开我，必要我喝，就愿你的意旨成全。”
{Mat 26:43} And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
{Mat 26:43} 又来，见他们睡着了，因为他们的眼睛困倦。
{Mat 26:44} So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again.
{Mat 26:44} 耶稣又离开他们去了。第三次祷告，说的话还是与先前一样。
{Mat 26:45} Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
{Mat 26:45} 于是来到门徒那里，对他们说：“现在你们仍然睡觉安歇吧（吧：或作吗？）！时候到了，人子被卖在罪人手里了。
{Mat 26:46} Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."
{Mat 26:46} 起来！我们走吧。看哪，卖我的人近了。”
{Mat 26:47} While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords /sord/ and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
{Mat 26:47} 说话之间，那十二个门徒里的犹大来了，并有许多人带着刀棒，从祭司长和民间的长老那里与他同来。
{Mat 26:48} Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I will kiss is the man; seize him."
{Mat 26:48} 那卖耶稣的给了他们一个暗号，说：“我与谁亲嘴，谁就是他。你们可以拿住他。”
{Mat 26:49} And he came up to Jesus at once and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" And he kissed him.
{Mat 26:49} 犹大随即到耶稣跟前，说：“请拉比安”，就与他亲嘴。
{Mat 26:50} Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you came to do." Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.
{Mat 26:50} 耶稣对他说：“朋友，你来要做的事，就做吧。”于是那些人上前，下手拿住耶稣。
{Mat 26:51} And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
{Mat 26:51} 有跟随耶稣的一个人伸手拔出刀来，将大祭司的仆人砍了一刀，削掉了他一个耳朵。
{Mat 26:52} Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
{Mat 26:52} 耶稣对他说：“收刀入鞘吧！凡动刀的，必死在刀下。
{Mat 26:53} Do you think that I cannot appeal /a'pEl/[请求] to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions /lEdZicn/[军团] of angels?
{Mat 26:53} 你想，我不能求我父现在为我差遣十二营多天使来吗？
{Mat 26:54} But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?"
{Mat 26:54} 若是这样，经上所说，事情必须如此的话怎么应验呢？”
{Mat 26:55} At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture /kxptScr/[抓捕] me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.
{Mat 26:55} 当时，耶稣对众人说：“你们带着刀棒出来拿我，如同拿强盗吗？我天天坐在殿里教训人，你们并没有拿我。
{Mat 26:56} But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled.
{Mat 26:56} 但这一切的事成就了，为要应验先知书上的话。”当下，门徒都离开他逃走了。
{Mat 26:57} Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
{Mat 26:57} 拿耶稣的人把他带到大祭司该亚法那里去；文士和长老已经在那里聚会。
{Mat 26:58} And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end.
{Mat 26:58} 彼得远远的跟着耶稣，直到大祭司的院子，进到里面，就和差役同坐，要看这事到底怎样。
{Mat 26:59} Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,
{Mat 26:59} 祭司长和全公会寻找假见证控告耶稣，要治死他。
{Mat 26:60} but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward
{Mat 26:60} 虽有好些人来作假见证，总得不着实据，末后有两个人前来，说：
{Mat 26:61} and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.'"
{Mat 26:61} “这个人曾说：‘我能拆毁神的殿，三日内又建造起来。’”
{Mat 26:62} And the high priest stood up and said, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"
{Mat 26:62} 大祭司就站起来，对耶稣说：“你什么都不回答吗？这些人作见证告你的是什么呢？”
{Mat 26:63} But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, "I adjure /a'dZUr/[严令] you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
{Mat 26:63} 耶稣却不言语。大祭司对他说：“我指着永生神叫你起誓告诉我们，你是神的儿子基督不是？”
{Mat 26:64} Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."
{Mat 26:64} 耶稣对他说：“你说的是。然而，我告诉你们，后来你们要看见人子坐在那权能者的右边，驾着天上的云降临。”
{Mat 26:65} Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has uttered blasphemy. /blxsfemy/ What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy.
{Mat 26:65} 大祭司就撕开衣服，说：“他说了僭妄的话，我们何必再用见证人呢？这僭妄的话，现在你们都听见了。
{Mat 26:66} What is your judgment?" They answered, "He deserves death."
{Mat 26:66} 你们的意见如何？”他们回答说：“他是该死的。”
{Mat 26:67} Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him,
{Mat 26:67} 他们就吐唾沫在他脸上，用拳头打他；也有用手掌打他的，说：
{Mat 26:68} saying, "Prophesy /profesI/[预告] to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?"
{Mat 26:68} “基督啊！你是先知，告诉我们打你的是谁？”
{Mat 26:69} Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
{Mat 26:69} 彼得在外面院子里坐着，有一个使女前来，说：“你素来也是同那加利利人耶稣一夥的。”
{Mat 26:70} But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."
{Mat 26:70} 彼得在众人面前却不承认，说：“我不知道你说的是什么！”
{Mat 26:71} And when he went out to the entrance, /entrans/ another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
{Mat 26:71} 既出去，到了门口，又有一个使女看见他，就对那里的人说：“这个人也是同拿撒勒人耶稣一夥的。”
{Mat 26:72} And again he denied it with an oath: "I do not know the man."
{Mat 26:72} 彼得又不承认，并且起誓说：“我不认得那个人。”
{Mat 26:73} After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent /xk'sent/[口音] betrays you."
{Mat 26:73} 过了不多的时候，旁边站着的人前来，对彼得说：“你真是他们一党的，你的口音把你露出来了。”
{Mat 26:74} Then he began to invoke /in'vOk/[召换] a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know the man." And immediately the rooster crowed.
{Mat 26:74} 彼得就发咒起誓的说：“我不认得那个人。”立时，鸡就叫了。
{Mat 26:75} And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly. [痛苦地]
{Mat 26:75} 彼得想起耶稣所说的话：“鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。”他就出去痛哭。
{Mat 27:1}  When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel /kaunsl/[商议] against Jesus to put him to death.
{Mat 27:1}  到了早晨，众祭司长和民间的长老大家商议要治死耶稣，
{Mat 27:2}  And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.
{Mat 27:2}  就把他捆绑，解去，交给巡抚彼拉多。
{Mat 27:3}  Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
{Mat 27:3}  这时候，卖耶稣的犹大看见耶稣已经定了罪，就后悔，把那三十块钱拿回来给祭司长和长老，说：
{Mat 27:4}  saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself."
{Mat 27:4}  “我卖了无辜之人的血是有罪了。”他们说：“那与我们有什么相干？你自己承当吧！”
{Mat 27:5}  And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself.
{Mat 27:5}  犹大就把那银钱丢在殿里，出去吊死了。
{Mat 27:6}  But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, /treZcry/[财库] since it is blood money."
{Mat 27:6}  祭司长拾起银钱来，说：“这是血价，不可放在库里。”
{Mat 27:7}  So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's /pot/[陶器匠] field as a burial place for strangers.
{Mat 27:7}  他们商议，就用那银钱买了窑户的一块田，为要埋葬外乡人。
{Mat 27:8}  Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
{Mat 27:8}  所以那块田直到今日还叫做“血田”。
{Mat 27:9}  Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,
{Mat 27:9}  这就应验了先知耶利米的话，说：“他们用那三十块钱，就是被估定之人的价钱，是以色列人中所估定的，
{Mat 27:10} and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."
{Mat 27:10} 买了窑户的一块田；这是照着主所吩咐我的。”
{Mat 27:11} Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so."
{Mat 27:11} 耶稣站在巡抚面前；巡抚问他说：“你是犹太人的王吗？”耶稣说：“你说的是。”
{Mat 27:12} But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer.
{Mat 27:12} 他被祭司长和长老控告的时候，什么都不回答。
{Mat 27:13} Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
{Mat 27:13} 彼拉多就对他说：“他们作见证告你这么多的事，你没有听见吗？”
{Mat 27:14} But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
{Mat 27:14} 耶稣仍不回答，连一句话也不说，以致巡抚甚觉希奇。
{Mat 27:15} Now at the feast the governor was accustomed /a'kCstCm/[习俗于] to release for the crowd any one prisoner /prisCncr/ whom they wanted.
{Mat 27:15} 巡抚有一个常例，每逢这节期，随众人所要的释放一个囚犯给他们。
{Mat 27:16} And they had then a notorious /nO'torics/[臭名昭著的] prisoner called Barabbas.
{Mat 27:16} 当时有一个出名的囚犯叫巴拉巴。
{Mat 27:17} So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
{Mat 27:17} 众人聚集的时候，彼拉多就对他们说：“你们要我释放那一个给你们？是巴拉巴呢？是称为基督的耶稣呢？’
{Mat 27:18} For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up.
{Mat 27:18} 巡抚原知道他们是因为嫉妒才把他解了来。
{Mat 27:19} Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream."
{Mat 27:19} 正坐堂的时候，他的夫人打发人来说：“这义人的事，你一点不可管，因为我今天在梦中为他受了许多的苦。”
{Mat 27:20} Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded /pcr'swAd/[说服] the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
{Mat 27:20} 祭司长和长老挑唆众人，求释放巴拉巴，除灭耶稣。
{Mat 27:21} The governor again said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas."
{Mat 27:21} 巡抚对众人说：“这两个人，你们要我释放那一个给你们呢？”他们说：“巴拉巴。”
{Mat 27:22} Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let him be crucified!"
{Mat 27:22} 彼拉多说：“这样，那称为基督的耶稣我怎么办他呢？”他们都说：“把他钉十字架！”
{Mat 27:23} And he said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Let him be crucified!"
{Mat 27:23} 巡抚说：“为什么呢？他做了什么恶事呢？”他们便极力的喊着说：“把他钉十字架！”
{Mat 27:24} So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot /rIct/[生乱] was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
{Mat 27:24} 彼拉多见说也无济于事，反要生乱，就拿水在众人面前洗手，说：“流这义人的血，罪不在我，你们承当吧。”
{Mat 27:25} And all the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"
{Mat 27:25} 众人都回答说：“他的血归到我们和我们的子孙身上。”
{Mat 27:26} Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged /skcrdZ/[鞭打] Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.
{Mat 27:26} 于是彼拉多释放巴拉巴给他们，把耶稣鞭打了，交给人钉十字架。
{Mat 27:27} Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion /ba'txliCn/[军营] before him.
{Mat 27:27} 巡抚的兵就把耶稣带进衙门，叫全营的兵都聚集在他那里。
{Mat 27:28} And they stripped him and put a scarlet /skarlet/[朱红色] robe on him,
{Mat 27:28} 他们给他脱了衣服，穿上一件朱红色袍子，
{Mat 27:29} and twisting together a crown /kraun/ of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
{Mat 27:29} 用荆棘编做冠冕，戴在他头上，拿一根苇子放在他右手里，跪在他面前，戏弄他，说：“恭喜，犹太人的王啊！”
{Mat 27:30} And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head.
{Mat 27:30} 又吐唾沫在他脸上，拿苇子打他的头。
{Mat 27:31} And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.
{Mat 27:31} 戏弄完了，就给他脱了袍子，仍穿上他自己的衣服，带他出去，要钉十字架。
{Mat 27:32} As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross.
{Mat 27:32} 他们出来的时候，遇见一个古利奈人，名叫西门，就勉强他同去，好背着耶稣的十字架。
{Mat 27:33} And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),
{Mat 27:33} 到了一个地方名叫各各他，意思就是“髑髅地”。
{Mat 27:34} they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, /gal/[胆汁] but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.
{Mat 27:34} 兵丁拿苦胆调和的酒给耶稣喝。他尝了，就不肯喝。
{Mat 27:35} And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
{Mat 27:35} 他们既将他钉在十字架上，就拈阄分他的衣服，
{Mat 27:36} Then they sat down and kept watch over him there.
{Mat 27:36} 又坐在那里看守他。
{Mat 27:37} And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
{Mat 27:37} 在他头以上安一个牌子，写着他的罪状，说：“这是犹太人的王耶稣。”
{Mat 27:38} Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.
{Mat 27:38} 当时，有两个强盗和他同钉十字架，一个在右边，一个在左边。
{Mat 27:39} And those who passed by derided /dE'rId/[讥诮] him, wagging /wxg/[摇摆] their heads
{Mat 27:39} 从那里经过的人讥诮他，摇着头，说：
{Mat 27:40} and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
{Mat 27:40} “你这拆毁圣殿、三日又建造起来的，可以救自己吧！你如果是神的儿子，就从十字架上下来吧！”
{Mat 27:41} So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,
{Mat 27:41} 祭司长和文士并长老也是这样戏弄他，说：
{Mat 27:42} "He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
{Mat 27:42} “他救了别人，不能救自己。他是以色列的王，现在可以从十字架上下来，我们就信他。
{Mat 27:43} He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
{Mat 27:43} 他倚靠神，神若喜悦他，现在可以救他；因为他曾说：‘我是神的儿子。’”
{Mat 27:44} And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.
{Mat 27:44} 那和他同钉的强盗也是这样的讥诮他。
{Mat 27:45} Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
{Mat 27:45} 从午正到申初，遍地都黑暗了。
{Mat 27:46} And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, /ElI/ Eli, lema /lema/ sabachthani?" /sabxkthanI/ that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken /for'sAk/[抛弃] me?"
{Mat 27:46} 约在申初，耶稣大声喊着说：“以利！以利！拉马撒巴各大尼？”就是说：“我的神！我的神！为什么离弃我？”
{Mat 27:47} And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, "This man is calling Elijah."
{Mat 27:47} 站在那里的人，有的听见就说：“这个人呼叫以利亚呢！”
{Mat 27:48} And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour /saur/[酸] wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.
{Mat 27:48} 内中有一个人赶紧跑去，拿海绒蘸满了醋，绑在苇子上，送给他喝。
{Mat 27:49} But the others said, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."
{Mat 27:49} 其余的人说：“且等着，看以利亚来救他不来。”
{Mat 27:50} And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.
{Mat 27:50} 耶稣又大声喊叫，气就断了。
{Mat 27:51} And behold, the curtain /kcrtan/[帐幕] of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, /Suk/[shake震动] and the rocks were split. [裂开]
{Mat 27:51} 忽然，殿里的幔子从上到下裂为两半，地也震动，磐石也崩裂，
{Mat 27:52} The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,
{Mat 27:52} 坟墓也开了，已睡圣徒的身体多有起来的。
{Mat 27:53} and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many.
{Mat 27:53} 到耶稣复活以后，他们从坟墓里出来，进了圣城，向许多人显现。
{Mat 27:54} When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe /o/[畏惧] and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
{Mat 27:54} 百夫长和一同看守耶稣的人看见地震并所经历的事，就极其害怕，说：“这真是神的儿子了！”
{Mat 27:55} There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,
{Mat 27:55} 有好些妇女在那里，远远的观看；他们是从加利利跟随耶稣来服事他的。
{Mat 27:56} among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
{Mat 27:56} 内中有抹大拉的马利亚，又有雅各和约西的母亲马利亚，并有西庇太两个儿子的母亲。
{Mat 27:57} When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, /xrimathEa/ named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus.
{Mat 27:57} 到了晚上，有一个财主，名叫约瑟，是亚利马太来的，他也是耶稣的门徒。
{Mat 27:58} He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
{Mat 27:58} 这人去见彼拉多，求耶稣的身体；彼拉多就吩咐给他。
{Mat 27:59} And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen /linen/[亚麻布] shroud
{Mat 27:59} 约瑟取了身体，用干净细麻布裹好，
{Mat 27:60} and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.
{Mat 27:60} 安放在自己的新坟墓里，就是他凿在磐石里的。他又把大石头辊到墓门口，就去了。
{Mat 27:61} Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite /opCzit/ the tomb.
{Mat 27:61} 有抹大拉的马利亚和那个马利亚在那里，对着坟墓坐着。
{Mat 27:62} The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, /prepa'rASCn/[预备] the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
{Mat 27:62} 次日，就是预备日的第二天，祭司长和法利赛人聚集来见彼拉多，说：
{Mat 27:63} and said, "Sir, we remember how that impostor /im'postcr/[冒名者] said, while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.'
{Mat 27:63} “大人，我们记得那诱惑人的还活着的时候曾说：‘三日后我要复活。’
{Mat 27:64} Therefore order the tomb to be made secure /sE'kUr/[安全] until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last fraud /frod/[骗局] will be worse than the first."
{Mat 27:64} 因此，请吩咐人将坟墓把守妥当，直到第三日，恐怕他的门徒来，把他偷了去，就告诉百姓说：‘他从死里复活了。’这样，那后来的迷惑比先前的更利害了！”
{Mat 27:65} Pilate said to them, "You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can."
{Mat 27:65} 彼拉多说：“你们有看守的兵，去吧！尽你们所能的把守妥当。”
{Mat 27:66} So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing /sEl/[封 < 小印章] the stone /stOn/ and setting a guard.
{Mat 27:66} 他们就带着看守的兵同去，封了石头，将坟墓把守妥当。
{Mat 28:1}  Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
{Mat 28:1}  安息日将尽，七日的头一日，天快亮的时候，抹大拉的马利亚和那个马利亚来看坟墓。
{Mat 28:2}  And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
{Mat 28:2}  忽然，地大震动；因为有主的使者从天上下来，把石头辊开，坐在上面。
{Mat 28:3}  His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. /snO/[雪]
{Mat 28:3}  他的像貌如同闪电，衣服洁白如雪。
{Mat 28:4}  And for fear of him the guards trembled /trembl/[发抖] and became like dead men.
{Mat 28:4}  看守的人就因他吓得浑身乱战，甚至和死人一样。
{Mat 28:5}  But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
{Mat 28:5}  天使对妇女说：“不要害怕！我知道你们是寻找那钉十字架的耶稣。
{Mat 28:6}  He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
{Mat 28:6}  他不在这里，照他所说的，已经复活了。你们来看安放主的地方。
{Mat 28:7}  Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you."
{Mat 28:7}  快去告诉他的门徒，说他从死里复活了，并且在你们以先往加利利去，在那里你们要见他。看哪，我已经告诉你们了。”
{Mat 28:8}  So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
{Mat 28:8}  妇女们就急忙离开坟墓，又害怕，又大大的欢喜，跑去要报给他的门徒。
{Mat 28:9}  And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
{Mat 28:9}  忽然，耶稣遇见他们，说：“愿你们平安！”他们就上前抱住他的脚拜他。
{Mat 28:10} Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."
{Mat 28:10} 耶稣对他们说：“不要害怕！你们去告诉我的弟兄，叫他们往加利利去，在那里必见我。”
{Mat 28:11} While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place.
{Mat 28:11} 他们去的时候，看守的兵有几个进城去，将所经历的事都报给祭司长。
{Mat 28:12} And when they had assembled /a'sembl/[集合] with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers
{Mat 28:12} 祭司长和长老聚集商议，就拿许多银钱给兵丁，说：
{Mat 28:13} and said, "Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole /stOl/[steal] him away while we were asleep.'
{Mat 28:13} “你们要这样说：‘夜间我们睡觉的时候，他的门徒来，把他偷去了。’
{Mat 28:14} And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."
{Mat 28:14} 倘若这话被巡抚听见，有我们劝他，保你们无事。”
{Mat 28:15} So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.
{Mat 28:15} 兵丁受了银钱，就照所嘱咐他们的去行。这话就传说在犹太人中间，直到今日。
{Mat 28:16} Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.
{Mat 28:16} 十一个门徒往加利利去，到了耶稣约定的山上。
{Mat 28:17} And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. /daut/
{Mat 28:17} 他们见了耶稣就拜他，然而还有人疑惑。
{Mat 28:18} And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
{Mat 28:18} 耶稣进前来，对他们说：“天上地下所有的权柄都赐给我了。
{Mat 28:19} Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
{Mat 28:19} 所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗（或作：给他们施洗，归于父、子、圣灵的名）。
{Mat 28:20} teaching them to observe /Cb'zcrv/[遵守、注意、观测] all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."
{Mat 28:20} 凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。”
