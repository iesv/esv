{Num 1:48}  因为耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 1:49}  "Only the tribe of Levi you shall not list, and you shall not take a census of them among the people of Israel.
{Num 1:49}  “惟独利未支派你不可数点，也不可在以色列人中计算他们的总数。
{Num 1:50}  But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it and shall camp around the tabernacle.
{Num 1:50}  只要派利未人管法柜的帐幕和其中的器具，并属乎帐幕的；他们要抬（或作：搬运）帐幕和其中的器具，并要办理帐幕的事，在帐幕的四围安营。
{Num 1:51}  When the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down, and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. And if any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death.

{Num 1:52}  The people of Israel shall pitch their tents by their companies, each man in his own camp and each man by his own standard.
{Num 1:52}  以色列人支搭帐棚，要照他们的军队，各归本营，各归本纛。
{Num 1:53}  But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the people of Israel. And the Levites shall keep guard over the tabernacle of the testimony."
{Num 1:53}  但利未人要在法柜帐幕的四围安营，免得忿怒临到以色列会众；利未人并要谨守法柜的帐幕。”
{Num 1:54}  Thus did the people of Israel; they did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.

{Num 2:33}  惟独利未人没有数在以色列人中，是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的。
{Num 2:34}  Thus did the people of Israel. According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they camped by their standards, and so they set out, each one in his clan, according to his fathers' house.
{Num 2:34}  以色列人就这样行，各人照他们的家室、宗族归于本纛，安营起行，都是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的。
{Num 3:1}   These are the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
{Num 3:1}   耶和华在西乃山晓谕摩西的日子，亚伦和摩西的后代如下：
{Num 3:2}   These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
{Num 3:2}   亚伦的儿子，长子名叫拿答，还有亚比户、以利亚撒、以他玛。
{Num 3:3}   These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to serve as priests.
{Num 3:3}   这是亚伦儿子的名字，都是受膏的祭司，是摩西叫他们承接圣职供祭司职分的。
{Num 3:4}   But Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of Aaron their father.
{Num 3:4}   拿答、亚比户在西乃的旷野向耶和华献凡火的时候就死在耶和华面前了。他们也没有儿子。以利亚撒、以他玛在他们的父亲亚伦面前供祭司的职分。
{Num 3:5}   And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 3:5}   耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 3:6}   "Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him.
{Num 3:6}   “你使利未支派近前来，站在祭司亚伦面前好服事他，
{Num 3:7}   They shall keep guard over him and over the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, as they minister at the tabernacle.
{Num 3:7}   替他和会众在会幕前守所吩咐的，办理帐幕的事。
{Num 3:8}   They shall guard all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, and keep guard over the people of Israel as they minister at the tabernacle.
{Num 3:8}   又要看守会幕的器具，并守所吩咐以色列人的，办理帐幕的事。
{Num 3:9}   And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the people of Israel.
{Num 3:9}   你要将利未人给亚伦和他的儿子，因为他们是从以色列人中选出来给他的。
{Num 3:10}  And you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall guard their priesthood. But if any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death."
{Num 3:10}  你要嘱咐亚伦和他的儿子谨守自己祭司的职任。近前来的外人必被治死。”
{Num 3:11}  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 3:11}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 3:12}  "Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the people of Israel. The Levites shall be mine,
{Num 3:12}  “我从以色列人中拣选了利未人，代替以色列人一切头生的；利未人要归我。
{Num 3:13}  for all the firstborn are mine. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for my own all the firstborn in Israel, both of man and of beast. They shall be mine: I am the LORD."
{Num 3:13}  因为凡头生的是我的；我在埃及地击杀一切头生的那日就把以色列中一切头生的，连人带牲畜都分别为圣归我；他们定要属我。我是耶和华。”
{Num 3:14}  And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
{Num 3:14}  耶和华在西乃的旷野晓谕摩西说：
{Num 3:15}  "List the sons of Levi, by fathers' houses and by clans; every male from a month old and upward you shall list."
{Num 3:15}  “你要照利未人的宗族、家室数点他们。凡一个月以外的男子都要数点。”
{Num 3:16}  So Moses listed them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded.
{Num 3:16}  于是摩西照耶和华所吩咐的数点他们。
{Num 3:17}  And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon and Kohath and Merari.
{Num 3:17}  利未众子的名字是革顺、哥辖、米拉利。
{Num 3:18}  And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans: Libni and Shimei.
{Num 3:18}  革顺的儿子，按着家室，是立尼、示每。
{Num 3:19}  And the sons of Kohath by their clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
{Num 3:19}  哥辖的儿子，按着家室，是暗兰、以斯哈、希伯伦、乌薛。
{Num 3:20}  And the sons of Merari by their clans: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites, by their fathers' houses.
{Num 3:20}  米拉利的儿子，按着家室，是抹利、母示。这些按着宗族是利未人的家室。
{Num 3:21}  To Gershon belonged the clan of the Libnites and the clan of the Shimeites; these were the clans of the Gershonites.
{Num 3:21}  属革顺的，有立尼族、示每族。这是革顺的二族。
{Num 3:22}  Their listing according to the number of all the males from a month old and upward was 7,500.
{Num 3:22}  其中被数、从一个月以外所有的男子共有七千五百名。
{Num 3:23}  The clans of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle on the west,
{Num 3:23}  这革顺的二族要在帐幕后西边安营。
{Num 3:24}  with Eliasaph, the son of Lael as chief of the fathers' house of the Gershonites.
{Num 3:24}  拉伊勒的儿子以利雅萨作革顺人宗族的首领。
{Num 3:25}  And the guard duty of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting involved the tabernacle, the tent with its covering, the screen for the entrance of the tent of meeting,

{Num 3:41}  And you shall take the Levites for me--I am the LORD--instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the people of Israel."

{Num 4:5}   起营的时候，亚伦和他儿子要进去摘下遮掩柜的幔子，用以蒙盖法柜，

{Num 4:15}  And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, as the camp sets out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry these, but they must not touch the holy things, lest they die. These are the things of the tent of meeting that the sons of Kohath are to carry.
{Num 4:15}  将要起营的时候，亚伦和他儿子把圣所和圣所的一切器具遮盖完了，哥辖的子孙就要来抬，只是不可摸圣物，免得他们死亡。会幕里这些物件是哥辖子孙所当抬的。

{Num 5:1}   耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 5:2}   "Command the people of Israel that they put out of the camp everyone who is leprous or has a discharge and everyone who is unclean through contact with the dead.
{Num 5:2}   “你吩咐以色列人，使一切长大麻疯的，患漏症的，并因死尸不洁净的，都出营外去。
{Num 5:3}   You shall put out both male and female, putting them outside the camp, that they may not defile their camp, in the midst of which I dwell."
{Num 5:3}   无论男女都要使他们出到营外，免得污秽他们的营；这营是我所住的。”
{Num 5:4}   And the people of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp; as the LORD said to Moses, so the people of Israel did.
{Num 5:4}   以色列人就这样行，使他们出到营外。耶和华怎样吩咐摩西，以色列人就怎样行了。
{Num 5:5}   And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 5:5}   耶和华对摩西说：
{Num 5:6}   "Speak to the people of Israel, When a man or woman commits any of the sins that people commit by breaking faith with the LORD, and that person realizes his guilt,
{Num 5:6}   “你晓谕以色列人说：无论男女，若犯了人所常犯的罪，以致干犯耶和华，那人就有了罪。
{Num 5:7}   he shall confess his sin that he has committed. And he shall make full restitution for his wrong, adding a fifth to it and giving it to him to whom he did the wrong.
{Num 5:7}   他要承认所犯的罪，将所亏负人的，如数赔还，另外加上五分之一，也归与所亏负的人。
{Num 5:8}   But if the man has no next of kin to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for wrong shall go to the LORD for the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement with which atonement is made for him.
{Num 5:8}   那人若没有亲属可受所赔还的，那所赔还的就要归与服事耶和华的祭司；至于那为他赎罪的公羊是在外。
{Num 5:9}   And every contribution, all the holy donations of the people of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.
{Num 5:9}   以色列人一切的圣物中，所奉给祭司的举祭都要归与祭司。
{Num 5:10}  Each one shall keep his holy donations: whatever anyone gives to the priest shall be his."
{Num 5:10}  各人所分别为圣的物，无论是什么，都要归给祭司。”
{Num 5:11}  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 5:11}  耶和华对摩西说：
{Num 5:12}  "Speak to the people of Israel, If any man's wife goes astray and breaks faith with him,
{Num 5:12}  “你晓谕以色列人说：人的妻若有邪行，得罪他丈夫，
{Num 5:13}  if a man lies with her sexually, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she is undetected though she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her, since she was not taken in the act,
{Num 5:13}  有人与他行淫，事情严密，瞒过他丈夫，而且他被玷污，没有作见证的人，当他行淫的时候也没有被捉住，
{Num 5:14}  and if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife who has defiled herself, or if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife, though she has not defiled herself,
{Num 5:14}  他丈夫生了疑恨的心，疑恨他，他是被玷污，或是他丈夫生了疑恨的心，疑恨他，他并没有被玷污，
{Num 5:15}  then the man shall bring his wife to the priest and bring the offering required of her, a tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
{Num 5:15}  这人就要将妻送到祭司那里，又为他带着大麦面伊法十分之一作供物，不可浇上油，也不可加上乳香；因为这是疑恨的素祭，是思念的素祭，使人思念罪孽。
{Num 5:16}  "And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the LORD.
{Num 5:16}  “祭司要使那妇人近前来，站在耶和华面前。
{Num 5:17}  And the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.
{Num 5:17}  祭司要把圣水盛在瓦器里，又从帐幕的地上取点尘土，放在水中。
{Num 5:18}  And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD and unbind the hair of the woman's head and place in her hands the grain offering of remembrance, which is the grain offering of jealousy. And in his hand the priest shall have the water of bitterness that brings the curse.
{Num 5:18}  祭司要叫那妇人蓬头散发，站在耶和华面前，把思念的素祭，就是疑恨的素祭，放在他手中。祭司手里拿着致咒诅的苦水，
{Num 5:19}  Then the priest shall make her take an oath, saying, 'If no man has lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while you were under your husband's authority, be free from this water of bitterness that brings the curse.
{Num 5:19}  要叫妇人起誓，对他说：‘若没有人与你行淫，也未曾背着丈夫做污秽的事，你就免受这致咒诅苦水的灾。
{Num 5:20}  But if you have gone astray, though you are under your husband's authority, and if you have defiled yourself, and some man other than your husband has lain with you,
{Num 5:20}  你若背着丈夫行了污秽的事，在你丈夫以外有人与你行淫，
{Num 5:21}  then' (let the priest make the woman take the oath of the curse, and say to the woman) 'the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD makes your thigh fall away and your body swell.
{Num 5:21}  （祭司叫妇人发咒起誓），愿耶和华叫你大腿消瘦，肚腹发胀，使你在你民中被人咒诅，成了誓语；
{Num 5:22}  May this water that brings the curse pass into your bowels and make your womb swell and your thigh fall away.' And the woman shall say, 'Amen, Amen.'
{Num 5:22}  并且这致咒诅的水入你的肠中，要叫你的肚腹发胀，大腿消瘦。’妇人要回答说：‘阿们，阿们。’
{Num 5:23}  "Then the priest shall write these curses in a book and wash them off into the water of bitterness.
{Num 5:23}  “祭司要写这咒诅的话，将所写的字抹在苦水里，
{Num 5:24}  And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain.
{Num 5:24}  又叫妇人喝这致咒诅的苦水；这水要进入他里面变苦了。
{Num 5:25}  And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand and shall wave the grain offering before the LORD and bring it to the altar.
{Num 5:25}  祭司要从妇人的手中取那疑恨的素祭，在耶和华面前摇一摇，拿到坛前；
{Num 5:26}  And the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering, as its memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
{Num 5:26}  又要从素祭中取出一把，作为这事的纪念，烧在坛上，然后叫妇人喝这水。
{Num 5:27}  And when he has made her drink the water, then, if she has defiled herself and has broken faith with her husband, the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain, and her womb shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away, and the woman shall become a curse among her people.
{Num 5:27}  叫他喝了以后，他若被玷污，得罪了丈夫，这致咒诅的水必进入他里面变苦了，他的肚腹就要发胀，大腿就要消瘦，那妇人便要在他民中被人咒诅。
{Num 5:28}  But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.
{Num 5:28}  若妇人没有被玷污，却是清洁的，就要免受这灾，且要怀孕。
{Num 5:29}  "This is the law in cases of jealousy, when a wife, though under her husband's authority, goes astray and defiles herself,
{Num 5:29}  “妻子背着丈夫行了污秽的事，
{Num 5:30}  or when the spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife. Then he shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall carry out for her all this law.
{Num 5:30}  或是人生了疑恨的心，疑恨他的妻，就有这疑恨的条例。那时他要叫妇人站在耶和华面前，祭司要在他身上照这条例而行。
{Num 5:31}  The man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman shall bear her iniquity."
{Num 5:31}  男人就为无罪，妇人必担当自己的罪孽。”
{Num 6:1}   And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 6:1}   耶和华对摩西说：
{Num 6:2}   "Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When either a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to the LORD,
{Num 6:2}   “你晓谕以色列人说：无论男女许了特别的愿，就是拿细耳人的愿（拿细耳就是归主的意思；下同），要离俗归耶和华。
{Num 6:3}   he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar made from wine or strong drink and shall not drink any juice of grapes or eat grapes, fresh or dried.
{Num 6:3}   他就要远离清酒浓酒，也不可喝什么清酒浓酒做的醋；不可喝什么葡萄汁，也不可吃鲜葡萄和干葡萄。
{Num 6:4}   All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grapevine, not even the seeds or the skins.
{Num 6:4}   在一切离俗的日子，凡葡萄树上结的，自核至皮所做的物，都不可吃。
{Num 6:5}   "All the days of his vow of separation, no razor shall touch his head. Until the time is completed for which he separates himself to the LORD, he shall be holy. He shall let the locks of hair of his head grow long.
{Num 6:5}   “在他一切许愿离俗的日子，不可用剃头刀剃头，要由发绺长长了。他要圣洁，直到离俗归耶和华的日子满了。
{Num 6:6}   "All the days that he separates himself to the LORD he shall not go near a dead body.
{Num 6:6}   在他离俗归耶和华的一切日子，不可挨近死尸。
{Num 6:7}   Not even for his father or for his mother, for brother or sister, if they die, shall he make himself unclean, because his separation to God is on his head.
{Num 6:7}   他的父母或是弟兄姊妹死了的时候，他不可因他们使自己不洁净，因为那离俗归神的凭据是在他头上。
{Num 6:8}   All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.
{Num 6:8}   在他一切离俗的日子是归耶和华为圣。
{Num 6:9}   "And if any man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.
{Num 6:9}   “若在他旁边忽然有人死了，以致沾染了他离俗的头，他要在第七日，得洁净的时候，剃头。
{Num 6:10}  On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to the priest to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
{Num 6:10}  第八日，他要把两只斑鸠或两只雏鸽带到会幕门口，交给祭司。
{Num 6:11}  and the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead body. And he shall consecrate his head that same day
{Num 6:11}  祭司要献一只作赎罪祭，一只作燔祭，为他赎那因死尸而有的罪，并要当日使他的头成为圣洁。
{Num 6:12}  and separate himself to the LORD for the days of his separation and bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering. But the previous period shall be void, because his separation was defiled.
{Num 6:12}  他要另选离俗归耶和华的日子，又要牵一只一岁的公羊羔来作赎愆祭；但先前的日子要归徒然，因为他在离俗之间被玷污了。
{Num 6:13}  "And this is the law for the Nazirite, when the time of his separation has been completed: he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
{Num 6:13}  “拿细耳人满了离俗的日子乃有这条例：人要领他到会幕门口，
{Num 6:14}  and he shall bring his gift to the LORD, one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish as a sin offering, and one ram without blemish as a peace offering,
{Num 6:14}  他要将供物奉给耶和华，就是一只没有残疾、一岁的公羊羔作燔祭，一只没有残疾、一岁的母羊羔作赎罪祭，和一只没有残疾的公绵羊作平安祭，
{Num 6:15}  and a basket of unleavened bread, loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and their grain offering and their drink offerings.
{Num 6:15}  并一筐子无酵调油的细面饼，与抹油的无酵薄饼，并同献的素祭和奠祭。
{Num 6:16}  And the priest shall bring them before the LORD and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering,
{Num 6:16}  祭司要在耶和华面前献那人的赎罪祭和燔祭；
{Num 6:17}  and he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offering to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also its grain offering and its drink offering.
{Num 6:17}  也要把那只公羊和那筐无酵饼献给耶和华作平安祭，又要将同献的素祭和奠祭献上。
{Num 6:18}  And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the entrance of the tent of meeting and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of the peace offering.
{Num 6:18}  拿细耳人要在会幕门口剃离俗的头，把离俗头上的发放在平安祭下的火上。
{Num 6:19}  And the priest shall take the shoulder of the ram, when it is boiled, and one unleavened loaf out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaved the hair of his consecration,
{Num 6:19}  他剃了以后，祭司就要取那已煮的公羊一条前腿，又从筐子里取一个无酵饼和一个无酵薄饼，都放在他手上。
{Num 6:20}  and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. They are a holy portion for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed. And after that the Nazirite may drink wine.
{Num 6:20}  祭司要拿这些作为摇祭，在耶和华面前摇一摇；这与所摇的胸、所举的腿同为圣物，归给祭司。然后拿细耳人可以喝酒。
{Num 6:21}  "This is the law of the Nazirite. But if he vows an offering to the LORD above his Nazirite vow, as he can afford, in exact accordance with the vow that he takes, then he shall do in addition to the law of the Nazirite."
{Num 6:21}  “许愿的拿细耳人为离俗所献的供物，和他以外所能得的献给耶和华，就有这条例。他怎样许愿就当照离俗的条例行。”
{Num 6:22}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 6:22}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 6:23}  "Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the people of Israel: you shall say to them,
{Num 6:23}  “你告诉亚伦和他儿子说：你们要这样为以色列人祝福，说：
{Num 6:24}  The LORD bless you and keep you;
{Num 6:24}  ‘愿耶和华赐福给你，保护你。
{Num 6:25}  the LORD make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;
{Num 6:25}  愿耶和华使他的脸光照你，赐恩给你。
{Num 6:26}  the LORD lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.
{Num 6:26}  愿耶和华向你仰脸，赐你平安。’
{Num 6:27}  "So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them."
{Num 6:27}  他们要如此奉我的名为以色列人祝福；我也要赐福给他们。”
{Num 7:1}   On the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and consecrated it with all its furnishings and had anointed and consecrated the altar with all its utensils,
{Num 7:1}   摩西立完了帐幕，就把帐幕用膏抹了，使他成圣，又把其中的器具和坛，并坛上的器具，都抹了，使他成圣。
{Num 7:2}   the chiefs of Israel, heads of their fathers' houses, who were the chiefs of the tribes, who were over those who were listed, approached
{Num 7:2}   当天，以色列的众首领，就是各族的族长，都来奉献。他们是各支派的首领，管理那些被数的人。
{Num 7:3}   and brought their offerings before the LORD, six wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two of the chiefs, and for each one an ox. They brought them before the tabernacle.
{Num 7:3}   他们把自己的供物送到耶和华面前，就是六辆篷子车和十二只公牛。每两个首领奉献一辆车，每首领奉献一只牛。他们把这些都奉到帐幕前。
{Num 7:4}   Then the LORD said to Moses,
{Num 7:4}   耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 7:5}   "Accept these from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service."
{Num 7:5}   “你要收下这些，好作会幕的使用，都要照利未人所办的事交给他们。”
{Num 7:6}   So Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
{Num 7:6}   于是摩西收了车和牛，交给利未人，
{Num 7:7}   Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service.
{Num 7:7}   把两辆车，四只牛，照革顺子孙所办的事交给他们，
{Num 7:8}   And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
{Num 7:8}   又把四辆车，八只牛，照米拉利子孙所办的事交给他们；他们都在祭司亚伦的儿子以他玛手下。
{Num 7:9}   But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because they were charged with the service of the holy things that had to be carried on the shoulder.
{Num 7:9}   但车与牛都没有交给哥辖子孙；因为他们办的是圣所的事，在肩头上抬圣物。
{Num 7:10}  And the chiefs offered offerings for the dedication of the altar on the day it was anointed; and the chiefs offered their offering before the altar.
{Num 7:10}  用膏抹坛的日子，首领都来行奉献坛的礼，众首领就在坛前献供物。
{Num 7:11}  And the LORD said to Moses, "They shall offer their offerings, one chief each day, for the dedication of the altar."
{Num 7:11}  耶和华对摩西说：“众首领为行奉献坛的礼，要每天一个首领来献供物。”

{Num 7:89}  And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim; and it spoke to him.
{Num 7:89}  摩西进会幕要与耶和华说话的时候，听见法柜的施恩座以上、二基路伯中间有与他说话的声音，就是耶和华与他说话。
{Num 8:1}   Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 8:1}   耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 8:2}   "Speak to Aaron and say to him, When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand."
{Num 8:2}   “你告诉亚伦说：点灯的时候，七盏灯都要向灯台前面发光。”
{Num 8:3}   And Aaron did so: he set up its lamps in front of the lampstand, as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Num 8:3}   亚伦便这样行。他点灯台上的灯，使灯向前发光，是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的。
{Num 8:4}   And this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was hammered work; according to the pattern that the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.
{Num 8:4}   这灯台的做法是用金子锤出来的，连座带花都是锤出来的。摩西制造灯台，是照耶和华所指示的样式。
{Num 8:5}   And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 8:5}   耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 8:6}   "Take the Levites from among the people of Israel and cleanse them.
{Num 8:6}   “你从以色列人中选出利未人来，洁净他们。
{Num 8:7}   Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them go with a razor over all their body, and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves.
{Num 8:7}   洁净他们当这样行：用除罪水弹在他们身上，又叫他们用剃头刀刮全身，洗衣服，洁净自己。
{Num 8:8}   Then let them take a bull from the herd and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another bull from the herd for a sin offering.
{Num 8:8}   然后叫他们取一只公牛犊，并同献的素祭，就是调油的细面；你要另取一只公牛犊作赎罪祭。
{Num 8:9}   And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting and assemble the whole congregation of the people of Israel.
{Num 8:9}   将利未人奉到会幕前，招聚以色列全会众。
{Num 8:10}  When you bring the Levites before the LORD, the people of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites,
{Num 8:10}  将利未人奉到耶和华面前，以色列人要按手在他们头上。
{Num 8:11}  and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the people of Israel, that they may do the service of the LORD.
{Num 8:11}  亚伦也将他们奉到耶和华面前，为以色列人当作摇祭，使他们好办耶和华的事。
{Num 8:12}  Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD to make atonement for the Levites.
{Num 8:12}  利未人要按手在那两只牛的头上；你要将一只作赎罪祭，一只作燔祭，献给耶和华，为利未人赎罪。
{Num 8:13}  And you shall set the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and shall offer them as a wave offering to the LORD.
{Num 8:13}  你也要使利未人站在亚伦和他儿子面前，将他们当作摇祭奉给耶和华。
{Num 8:14}  "Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the people of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.
{Num 8:14}  “这样，你从以色列人中将利未人分别出来，利未人便要归我。
{Num 8:15}  And after that the Levites shall go in to serve at the tent of meeting, when you have cleansed them and offered them as a wave offering.
{Num 8:15}  此后利未人要进去办会幕的事，你要洁净他们，将他们当作摇祭奉上；
{Num 8:16}  For they are wholly given to me from among the people of Israel. Instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the people of Israel, I have taken them for myself.
{Num 8:16}  因为他们是从以色列人中全然给我的，我拣选他们归我，是代替以色列人中一切头生的。
{Num 8:17}  For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself,
{Num 8:17}  以色列人中一切头生的，连人带牲畜，都是我的。我在埃及地击杀一切头生的那天，将他们分别为圣归我。
{Num 8:18}  and I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel.
{Num 8:18}  我拣选利未人代替以色列人中一切头生的。
{Num 8:19}  And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the people of Israel, to do the service for the people of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the people of Israel, that there may be no plague among the people of Israel when the people of Israel come near the sanctuary."
{Num 8:19}  我从以色列人中将利未人当作赏赐给亚伦和他的儿子，在会幕中办以色列人的事，又为以色列人赎罪，免得他们挨近圣所，有灾殃临到他们中间。”
{Num 8:20}  Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the people of Israel to the Levites. According to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, the people of Israel did to them.
{Num 8:20}  摩西、亚伦，并以色列全会众便向利未人如此行。凡耶和华指着利未人所吩咐摩西的，以色列人就向他们这样行。
{Num 8:21}  And the Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes, and Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the LORD, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
{Num 8:21}  于是利未人洁净自己，除了罪，洗了衣服；亚伦将他们当作摇祭奉到耶和华面前，又为他们赎罪，洁净他们。
{Num 8:22}  And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.
{Num 8:22}  然后利未人进去，在亚伦和他儿子面前，在会幕中办事。耶和华指着利未人怎样吩咐摩西，以色列人就怎样向他们行了。
{Num 8:23}  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 8:23}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 8:24}  "This applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall come to do duty in the service of the tent of meeting.
{Num 8:24}  “利未人是这样：从二十五岁以外，他们要前来任职，办会幕的事。
{Num 8:25}  And from the age of fifty years they shall withdraw from the duty of the service and serve no more.
{Num 8:25}  到了五十岁要停工退任，不再办事，
{Num 8:26}  They minister to their brothers in the tent of meeting by keeping guard, but they shall do no service. Thus shall you do to the Levites in assigning their duties."
{Num 8:26}  只要在会幕里，和他们的弟兄一同伺候，谨守所吩咐的，不再办事了。至于所吩咐利未人的，你要这样向他们行。”
{Num 9:1}   And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
{Num 9:1}   以色列人出埃及地以后，第二年正月，耶和华在西乃的旷野吩咐摩西说：
{Num 9:2}   "Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time.
{Num 9:2}   “以色列人应当在所定的日期守逾越节，
{Num 9:3}   On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it."
{Num 9:3}   就是本月十四日黄昏的时候，你们要在所定的日期守这节，要按这节的律例典章而守。”
{Num 9:4}   So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover.
{Num 9:4}   于是摩西吩咐以色列人守逾越节。
{Num 9:5}   And they kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did.
{Num 9:5}   他们就在西乃的旷野，正月十四日黄昏的时候，守逾越节。凡耶和华所吩咐摩西的，以色列人都照样行了。
{Num 9:6}   And there were certain men who were unclean through touching a dead body, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
{Num 9:6}   有几个人因死尸而不洁净，不能在那日守逾越节。当日他们到摩西、亚伦面前，
{Num 9:7}   And those men said to him, "We are unclean through touching a dead body. Why are we kept from bringing the LORD's offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?"
{Num 9:7}   说：“我们虽因死尸而不洁净，为何被阻止、不得同以色列人在所定的日期献耶和华的供物呢？”
{Num 9:8}   And Moses said to them, "Wait, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you."
{Num 9:8}   摩西对他们说：“你们暂且等候，我可以去听耶和华指着你们是怎样吩咐的。”
{Num 9:9}   The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 9:9}   耶和华对摩西说：
{Num 9:10}  "Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is on a long journey, he shall still keep the Passover to the LORD.
{Num 9:10}  “你晓谕以色列人说：你们和你们后代中，若有人因死尸而不洁净，或在远方行路，还要向耶和华守逾越节。
{Num 9:11}  In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
{Num 9:11}  他们要在二月十四日黄昏的时候，守逾越节。要用无酵饼与苦菜，和逾越节的羊羔同吃。
{Num 9:12}  They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break any of its bones; according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it.
{Num 9:12}  一点不可留到早晨；羊羔的骨头一根也不可折断。他们要照逾越节的一切律例而守。
{Num 9:13}  But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover, that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the LORD's offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.
{Num 9:13}  那洁净而不行路的人若推辞不守逾越节，那人要从民中剪除；因为他在所定的日期不献耶和华的供物，应该担当他的罪。
{Num 9:14}  And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native."
{Num 9:14}  若有外人寄居在你们中间，愿意向耶和华守逾越节，他要照逾越节的律例典章行，不管是寄居的是本地人，同归一例。”
{Num 9:15}  On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony. And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning.
{Num 9:15}  立起帐幕的那日，有云彩遮盖帐幕，就是法柜的帐幕；从晚上到早晨，云彩在其上，形状如火。
{Num 9:16}  So it was always: the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night.
{Num 9:16}  常是这样，云彩遮盖帐幕，夜间形状如火。
{Num 9:17}  And whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped.
{Num 9:17}  云彩几时从帐幕收上去，以色列人就几时起行；云彩在那里停住，以色列人就在那里安营。
{Num 9:18}  At the command of the LORD the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the LORD they camped. As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.
{Num 9:18}  以色列人遵耶和华的吩咐起行，也遵耶和华的吩咐安营。云彩在帐幕上停住几时，他们就住营几时。
{Num 9:19}  Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and did not set out.
{Num 9:19}  云彩在帐幕上停留许多日子，以色列人就守耶和华所吩咐的不起行。
{Num 9:20}  Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the LORD they remained in camp; then according to the command of the LORD they set out.
{Num 9:20}  有时云彩在帐幕上几天，他们就照耶和华的吩咐住营，也照耶和华的吩咐起行。
{Num 9:21}  And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning. And when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they set out.
{Num 9:21}  有时从晚上到早晨，有这云彩在帐幕上；早晨云彩收上去，他们就起行。有时昼夜云彩停在帐幕上，收上去的时候，他们就起行。
{Num 9:22}  Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel remained in camp and did not set out, but when it lifted they set out.
{Num 9:22}  云彩停留在帐幕上，无论是两天，是一月，是一年，以色列人就住营不起行；但云彩收上去，他们就起行。
{Num 9:23}  At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out. They kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD by Moses.
{Num 9:23}  他们遵耶和华的吩咐安营，也遵耶和华的吩咐起行。他们守耶和华所吩咐的，都是凭耶和华吩咐摩西的。
{Num 10:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 10:1}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 10:2}  "Make two silver trumpets. Of hammered work you shall make them, and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for breaking camp.
{Num 10:2}  “你要用银子做两枝号，都要锤出来的，用以招聚会众，并叫众营起行。
{Num 10:3}  And when both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
{Num 10:3}  吹这号的时候，全会众要到你那里，聚集在会幕门口。
{Num 10:4}  But if they blow only one, then the chiefs, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.
{Num 10:4}  若单吹一枝，众首领，就是以色列军中的统领，要聚集到你那里。
{Num 10:5}  When you blow an alarm, the camps that are on the east side shall set out.
{Num 10:5}  吹出大声的时候，东边安的营都要起行。
{Num 10:6}  And when you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out.
{Num 10:6}  二次吹出大声的时候，南边安的营都要起行。他们将起行，必吹出大声。
{Num 10:7}  But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow a long blast, but you shall not sound an alarm.
{Num 10:7}  但招聚会众的时候，你们要吹号，却不要吹出大声。
{Num 10:8}  And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. The trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
{Num 10:8}  亚伦子孙作祭司的要吹这号；这要作你们世世代代永远的定例。
{Num 10:9}  And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.
{Num 10:9}  你们在自己的地，与欺压你们的敌人打仗，就要用号吹出大声，便在耶和华你们的神面前得蒙纪念，也蒙拯救脱离仇敌。
{Num 10:10} On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings. They shall be a reminder of you before your God: I am the LORD your God."
{Num 10:10} 在你们快乐的日子和节期，并月朔，献燔祭和平安祭，也要吹号，这都要在你们的神面前作为纪念。我是耶和华你们的神。”
{Num 10:11} In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony,
{Num 10:11} 第二年二月二十日，云彩从法柜的帐幕收上去。
{Num 10:12} and the people of Israel set out by stages from the wilderness of Sinai. And the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.
{Num 10:12} 以色列人就按站往前行，离开西乃的旷野，云彩停住在巴兰的旷野。

{Num 10:29} And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us, and we will do good to you, for the LORD has promised good to Israel."
{Num 10:29} 摩西对他岳父（或作：内兄）米甸人流珥的儿子何巴说：“我们要行路，往耶和华所应许之地去；他曾说：‘我要将这地赐给你们。’现在求你和我们同去，我们必厚待你，因为耶和华指着以色列人已经应许给好处。”
{Num 10:30} But he said to him, "I will not go. I will depart to my own land and to my kindred."
{Num 10:30} 何巴回答说：“我不去；我要回本地本族那里去。”
{Num 10:31} And he said, "Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us.

{Num 10:32} And if you do go with us, whatever good the LORD will do to us, the same will we do to you."
{Num 10:32} 你若和我们同去，将来耶和华有什么好处待我们，我们也必以什么好处待你。”
{Num 10:33} So they set out from the mount of the LORD three days' journey. And the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them.
{Num 10:33} 以色列人离开耶和华的山，往前行了三天的路程；耶和华的约柜在前头行了三天的路程，为他们寻找安歇的地方。

{Num 10:36} 约柜停住的时候，他就说：“耶和华啊，求你回到以色列的千万人中！”
{Num 11:1}  And the people complained in the hearing of the LORD about their misfortunes, and when the LORD heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed some outlying parts of the camp.
{Num 11:1}  众百姓发怨言，他们的恶语达到耶和华的耳中。耶和华听见了就怒气发作，使火在他们中间焚烧，直烧到营的边界。
{Num 11:2}  Then the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down.
{Num 11:2}  百姓向摩西哀求，摩西祈求耶和华，火就熄了。
{Num 11:3}  So the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them.
{Num 11:3}  那地方便叫做他备拉，因为耶和华的火烧在他们中间。
{Num 11:4}  Now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving. And the people of Israel also wept again and said, "Oh that we had meat to eat!
{Num 11:4}  他们中间的闲杂人大起贪欲的心；以色列人又哭号说：“谁给我们肉吃呢？
{Num 11:5}  We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.
{Num 11:5}  我们记得，在埃及的时候不花钱就吃鱼，也记得有黄瓜、西瓜、韭菜、葱、蒜。
{Num 11:6}  But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at."
{Num 11:6}  现在我们的心血枯竭了，除这吗哪以外，在我们眼前并没有别的东西。”
{Num 11:7}  Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.
{Num 11:7}  （这吗哪彷佛芫荽子，又好像珍珠。
{Num 11:8}  The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.
{Num 11:8}  百姓周围行走，把吗哪收起来，或用磨推，或用臼捣，煮在锅中，又做成饼，滋味好像新油。
{Num 11:9}  When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.
{Num 11:9}  夜间露水降在营中，吗哪也随着降下。）
{Num 11:10} Moses heard the people weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And the anger of the LORD blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased.
{Num 11:10} 摩西听见百姓各在各家的帐棚门口哭号。耶和华的怒气便大发作，摩西就不喜悦。
{Num 11:11} Moses said to the LORD, "Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?
{Num 11:11} 摩西对耶和华说：“你为何苦待仆人？我为何不在你眼前蒙恩，竟把这管理百姓的重任加在我身上呢？
{Num 11:12} Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, 'Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing child,' to the land that you swore to give their fathers?
{Num 11:12} 这百姓岂是我怀的胎，岂是我生下来的呢？你竟对我说：‘把他们抱在怀里，如养育之父抱吃奶的孩子，直抱到你起誓应许给他们祖宗的地去。’
{Num 11:13} Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, 'Give us meat, that we may eat.'
{Num 11:13} 我从那里得肉给这百姓吃呢？他们都向我哭号说：‘你给我们肉吃吧！’
{Num 11:14} I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me.
{Num 11:14} 管理这百姓的责任太重了，我独自担当不起。
{Num 11:15} If you will treat me like this, kill me at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness."
{Num 11:15} 你这样待我，我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你立时将我杀了，不叫我见自己的苦情。”
{Num 11:16} Then the LORD said to Moses, "Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you.
{Num 11:16} 耶和华对摩西说：“你从以色列的长老中招聚七十个人，就是你所知道作百姓的长老和官长的，到我这里来，领他们到会幕前，使他们和你一同站立。
{Num 11:17} And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone.
{Num 11:17} 我要在那里降临，与你说话，也要把降于你身上的灵分赐他们，他们就和你同当这管百姓的重任，免得你独自担当。
{Num 11:18} And say to the people, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD, saying, "Who will give us meat to eat? For it was better for us in Egypt." Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat.
{Num 11:18} 又要对百姓说：‘你们应当自洁，预备明天吃肉，因为你们哭号说：谁给我们肉吃！我们在埃及很好。这声音达到了耶和华的耳中，所以他必给你们肉吃。
{Num 11:19} You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,
{Num 11:19} 你们不止吃一天、两天、五天、十天、二十天，
{Num 11:20} but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before him, saying, "Why did we come out of Egypt?"'"
{Num 11:20} 要吃一个整月，甚至肉从你们鼻孔里喷出来，使你们厌恶了，因为你们厌弃住在你们中间的耶和华，在他面前哭号说：我们为何出了埃及呢！’”
{Num 11:21} But Moses said, "The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot, and you have said, 'I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!'
{Num 11:21} 摩西对耶和华说：“这与我同住的百姓、步行的男人有六十万，你还说：‘我要把肉给他们，使他们可以吃一个整月。’
{Num 11:22} Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, and be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, and be enough for them?"
{Num 11:22} 难道给他们宰了羊群牛群，或是把海中所有的鱼都聚了来，就够他们吃吗？”
{Num 11:23} And the LORD said to Moses, "Is the LORD's hand shortened? Now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not."
{Num 11:23} 耶和华对摩西说：“耶和华的膀臂岂是缩短了吗？现在要看我的话向你应验不应验。”
{Num 11:24} So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent.
{Num 11:24} 摩西出去，将耶和华的话告诉百姓，又招聚百姓的长老中七十个人来，使他们站在会幕的四围。
{Num 11:25} Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they did not continue doing it.
{Num 11:25} 耶和华在云中降临，对摩西说话，把降与他身上的灵分赐那七十个长老。灵停在他们身上的时候，他们就受感说话，以后却没有再说。
{Num 11:26} Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.
{Num 11:26} 但有两个人仍在营里，一个名叫伊利达，一个名叫米达。他们本是在那些被录的人中，却没有到会幕那里去。灵停在他们身上，他们就在营里说预言。
{Num 11:27} And a young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."
{Num 11:27} 有个少年人跑来告诉摩西说：“伊利达、米达在营里说预言。”
{Num 11:28} And Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth, said, "My lord Moses, stop them."
{Num 11:28} 摩西的帮手，嫩的儿子约书亚，就是摩西所拣选的一个人，说：“请我主摩西禁止他们。”
{Num 11:29} But Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the LORD's people were prophets, that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!"
{Num 11:29} 摩西对他说：“你为我的缘故嫉妒人吗？惟愿耶和华的百姓都受感说话！愿耶和华把他的灵降在他们身上！”
{Num 11:30} And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
{Num 11:30} 于是，摩西和以色列的长老都回到营里去。
{Num 11:31} Then a wind from the LORD sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the ground.
{Num 11:31} 有风从耶和华那里刮起，把鹌鹑由海面刮来，飞散在营边和营的四围；这边约有一天的路程，那边约有一天的路程，离地面约有二肘。
{Num 11:32} And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
{Num 11:32} 百姓起来，终日终夜，并次日一整天，捕取鹌鹑；至少的也取了十贺梅珥，为自己摆列在营的四围。
{Num 11:33} While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck down the people with a very great plague.
{Num 11:33} 肉在他们牙齿之间尚未嚼烂，耶和华的怒气就向他们发作，用最重的灾殃击杀了他们。
{Num 11:34} Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving.
{Num 11:34} 那地方便叫做基博罗哈他瓦（就是贪欲之人的坟墓），因为他们在那里葬埋那起贪欲之心的人。
{Num 11:35} From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.
{Num 11:35} 百姓从基博罗哈他瓦走到哈洗录，就住在哈洗录。
{Num 12:1}  Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.
{Num 12:1}  摩西娶了古实女子为妻。米利暗和亚伦因他所娶的古实女子就毁谤他，
{Num 12:2}  And they said, "Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" And the LORD heard it.
{Num 12:2}  说：“难道耶和华单与摩西说话，不也与我们说话吗？”这话耶和华听见了。
{Num 12:3}  Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth.
{Num 12:3}  （摩西为人极其谦和，胜过世上的众人。）
{Num 12:4}  And suddenly the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, "Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting." And the three of them came out.
{Num 12:4}  耶和华忽然对摩西、亚伦、米利暗说：“你们三个人都出来，到会幕这里。”他们三个人就出来了。
{Num 12:5}  And the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward.
{Num 12:5}  耶和华在云柱中降临，站在会幕门口，召亚伦和米利暗，二人就出来了。
{Num 12:6}  And he said, "Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD make myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream.
{Num 12:6}  耶和华说：“你们且听我的话：你们中间若有先知，我耶和华必在异象中向他显现，在梦中与他说话。
{Num 12:7}  Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house.
{Num 12:7}  我的仆人摩西不是这样；他是在我全家尽忠的。
{Num 12:8}  With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in riddles, and he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
{Num 12:8}  我要与他面对面说话，乃是明说，不用谜语，并且他必见我的形像。你们毁谤我的仆人摩西，为何不惧怕呢？”
{Num 12:9}  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and he departed.
{Num 12:9}  耶和华就向他们二人发怒而去。
{Num 12:10} When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
{Num 12:10} 云彩从会幕上挪开了，不料，米利暗长了大麻疯，有雪那样白。亚伦一看米利暗长了大麻疯，
{Num 12:11} And Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, do not punish us because we have done foolishly and have sinned.
{Num 12:11} 就对摩西说：“我主啊，求你不要因我们愚昧犯罪，便将这罪加在我们身上。
{Num 12:12} Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother's womb."
{Num 12:12} 求你不要使他像那出母腹、肉已半烂的死胎。”
{Num 12:13} And Moses cried to the LORD, "O God, please heal her--please."
{Num 12:13} 于是摩西哀求耶和华说：“神啊，求你医治他！”
{Num 12:14} But the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again."
{Num 12:14} 耶和华对摩西说：“他父亲若吐唾沫在他脸上，他岂不蒙羞七天吗？现在要把他在营外关锁七天，然后才可以领他进来。”
{Num 12:15} So Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again.
{Num 12:15} 于是米利暗关锁在营外七天。百姓没有行路，直等到把米利暗领进来。
{Num 12:16} After that the people set out from Hazeroth, and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
{Num 12:16} 以后百姓从哈洗录起行，在巴兰的旷野安营。
{Num 13:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 13:1}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 13:2}  "Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel. From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a chief among them."
{Num 13:2}  “你打发人去窥探我所赐给以色列人的迦南地，他们每支派中要打发一个人，都要作首领的。”
{Num 13:3}  So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the people of Israel.
{Num 13:3}  摩西就照耶和华的吩咐从巴兰的旷野打发他们去；他们都是以色列人的族长。
{Num 13:4}  And these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
{Num 13:4}  他们的名字：属流便支派的有撒刻的的儿子沙母亚。
{Num 13:5}  from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
{Num 13:5}  属西缅支派的有何利的儿子的沙法。
{Num 13:6}  from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
{Num 13:6}  属犹大支派的有耶孚尼的儿子迦勒。
{Num 13:7}  from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
{Num 13:7}  属以萨迦支派的有约色的儿子以迦。
{Num 13:8}  from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;
{Num 13:8}  属以法莲支派的有嫩的儿子何希阿。
{Num 13:9}  from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
{Num 13:9}  属便雅悯支派的有拉孚的儿子帕提。
{Num 13:10} from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
{Num 13:10} 属西布伦支派的有梭底的儿子迦叠。
{Num 13:11} from the tribe of Joseph (that is, from the tribe of Manasseh), Gaddi the son of Susi;
{Num 13:11} 约瑟的子孙，属玛拿西支派的有稣西的儿子迦底。
{Num 13:12} from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
{Num 13:12} 属但支派的有基玛利的儿子亚米利。
{Num 13:13} from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
{Num 13:13} 属亚设支派的有米迦勒的儿子西帖。
{Num 13:14} from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
{Num 13:14} 属拿弗他利支派的有缚西的儿子拿比。
{Num 13:15} from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
{Num 13:15} 属迦得支派的有玛基的儿子臼利。
{Num 13:16} These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
{Num 13:16} 这就是摩西所打发、窥探那地之人的名字。摩西就称嫩的儿子何希阿为约书亚。
{Num 13:17} Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, "Go up into the Negeb and go up into the hill country,
{Num 13:17} 摩西打发他们去窥探迦南地，说：“你们从南地上山地去，
{Num 13:18} and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,
{Num 13:18} 看那地如何，其中所住的民是强是弱，是多是少，
{Num 13:19} and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,
{Num 13:19} 所住之处是好是歹，所住之处是营盘是坚城。
{Num 13:20} and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land." Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.
{Num 13:20} 又看那地土是肥美是瘠薄，其中有树木没有。你们要放开胆量，把那地的果子带些来。”（那时正是葡萄初熟的时候。）
{Num 13:21} So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo-hamath.
{Num 13:21} 他们上去窥探那地，从寻的旷野到利合，直到哈马口。
{Num 13:22} They went up into the Negeb and came to Hebron. Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
{Num 13:22} 他们从南地上去，到了希伯仑；在那里有亚衲族人亚希幔、示筛、挞买。（原来希伯仑城被建造比埃及的锁安城早七年。）
{Num 13:23} And they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them; they also brought some pomegranates and figs.
{Num 13:23} 他们到了以实各谷，从那里砍了葡萄树的一枝，上头有一挂葡萄，两个人用杠抬着，又带了些石榴和无花果来。
{Num 13:24} That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster that the people of Israel cut down from there.
{Num 13:24} （因为以色列人从那里砍来的那挂葡萄，所以那地方叫做以实各谷。）
{Num 13:25} At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.
{Num 13:25} 过了四十天，他们窥探那地才回来，
{Num 13:26} And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
{Num 13:26} 到了巴兰旷野的加低斯，见摩西、亚伦，并以色列的全会众，回报摩西、亚伦，并全会众，又把那地的果子给他们看；
{Num 13:27} And they told him, "We came to the land to which you sent us. It flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
{Num 13:27} 又告诉摩西说：“我们到了你所打发我们去的那地，果然是流奶与蜜之地；这就是那地的果子。
{Num 13:28} However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there.
{Num 13:28} 然而住那地的民强壮，城邑也坚固宽大，并且我们在那里看见了亚衲族的人。
{Num 13:29} The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb. The Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country. And the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan."
{Num 13:29} 亚玛力人住在南地；赫人、耶布斯人、亚摩利人住在山地；迦南人住在海边并约但河旁。”
{Num 13:30} But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able to overcome it."
{Num 13:30} 迦勒在摩西面前安抚百姓，说：“我们立刻上去得那地吧！我们足能得胜。”
{Num 13:31} Then the men who had gone up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are."
{Num 13:31} 但那些和他同去的人说：“我们不能上去攻击那民，因为他们比我们强壮。”
{Num 13:32} So they brought to the people of Israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out, saying, "The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people that we saw in it are of great height.
{Num 13:32} 探子中有人论到所窥探之地，向以色列人报恶信，说：“我们所窥探、经过之地是吞吃居民之地，我们在那里所看见的人民都身量高大。
{Num 13:33} And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them."
{Num 13:33} 我们在那里看见亚衲族人，就是伟人；他们是伟人的后裔。据我们看，自己就如蚱蜢一样；据他们看，我们也是如此。”
{Num 14:1}  Then all the congregation raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night.
{Num 14:1}  当下，全会众大声喧嚷；那夜百姓都哭号。
{Num 14:2}  And all the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!
{Num 14:2}  以色列众人向摩西、亚伦发怨言；全会众对他们说：“巴不得我们早死在埃及地，或是死在这旷野。
{Num 14:3}  Why is the LORD bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become a prey. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?"
{Num 14:3}  耶和华为什么把我们领到那地，使我们倒在刀下呢？我们的妻子和孩子必被掳掠。我们回埃及去岂不好吗？”
{Num 14:4}  And they said to one another, "Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt."
{Num 14:4}  众人彼此说：“我们不如立一个首领回埃及去吧！”
{Num 14:5}  Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the people of Israel.
{Num 14:5}  摩西、亚伦就俯伏在以色列全会众面前。
{Num 14:6}  And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes
{Num 14:6}  窥探地的人中，嫩的儿子约书亚和耶孚尼的儿子迦勒撕裂衣服，
{Num 14:7}  and said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, "The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.
{Num 14:7}  对以色列全会众说：“我们所窥探、经过之地是极美之地。
{Num 14:8}  If the LORD delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey.
{Num 14:8}  耶和华若喜悦我们，就必将我们领进那地，把地赐给我们；那地原是流奶与蜜之地。
{Num 14:9}  Only do not rebel against the LORD. And do not fear the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their protection is removed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them."
{Num 14:9}  但你们不可背叛耶和华，也不要怕那地的居民；因为他们是我们的食物，并且荫庇他们的已经离开他们。有耶和华与我们同在，不要怕他们！”
{Num 14:10} Then all the congregation said to stone them with stones. But the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.
{Num 14:10} 但全会众说：“拿石头打死他们二人。”忽然，耶和华的荣光在会幕中向以色列众人显现。
{Num 14:11} And the LORD said to Moses, "How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?
{Num 14:11} 耶和华对摩西说：“这百姓藐视我要到几时呢？我在他们中间行了这一切神迹，他们还不信我要到几时呢？
{Num 14:12} I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they."
{Num 14:12} 我要用瘟疫击杀他们，使他们不得承受那地，叫你的后裔成为大国，比他们强胜。”
{Num 14:13} But Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for you brought up this people in your might from among them,
{Num 14:13} 摩西对耶和华说：“埃及人必听见这事；因为你曾施展大能，将这百姓从他们中间领上来。
{Num 14:14} and they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you, O LORD, are in the midst of this people. For you, O LORD, are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
{Num 14:14} 埃及人要将这事传给迦南地的居民；那民已经听见你耶和华是在这百姓中间；因为你面对面被人看见，有你的云彩停在他们以上。你日间在云柱中，夜间在火柱中，在他们前面行。
{Num 14:15} Now if you kill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard your fame will say,
{Num 14:15} 如今你若把这百姓杀了，如杀一人，那些听见你名声的列邦必议论说：
{Num 14:16} 'It is because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land that he swore to give to them that he has killed them in the wilderness.'
{Num 14:16} ‘耶和华因为不能把这百姓领进他向他们起誓应许之地，所以在旷野把他们杀了。’
{Num 14:17} And now, please let the power of the Lord be great as you have promised, saying,
{Num 14:17} 现在求主大显能力，照你所说过的话说：
{Num 14:18} 'The LORD is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, to the third and the fourth generation.'
{Num 14:18} ‘耶和华不轻易发怒，并有丰盛的慈爱，赦免罪孽和过犯；万不以有罪的为无罪，必追讨他的罪，自父及子，直到三、四代。’
{Num 14:19} Please pardon the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of your steadfast love, just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt until now."
{Num 14:19} 求你照你的大慈爱赦免这百姓的罪孽，好像你从埃及到如今常赦免他们一样。”
{Num 14:20} Then the LORD said, "I have pardoned, according to your word.
{Num 14:20} 耶和华说：“我照着你的话赦免了他们。
{Num 14:21} But truly, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD,
{Num 14:21} 然我指着我的永生起誓，遍地要被我的荣耀充满。
{Num 14:22} none of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have put me to the test these ten times and have not obeyed my voice,
{Num 14:22} 这些人虽看见我的荣耀和我在埃及与旷野所行的神迹，仍然试探我这十次，不听从我的话，
{Num 14:23} shall see the land that I swore to give to their fathers. And none of those who despised me shall see it.
{Num 14:23} 他们断不得看见我向他们的祖宗所起誓应许之地。凡藐视我的，一个也不得看见；
{Num 14:24} But my servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me fully, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it.
{Num 14:24} 惟独我的仆人迦勒，因他另有一个心志，专一跟从我，我就把他领进他所去过的那地；他的后裔也必得那地为业。
{Num 14:25} Now, since the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valleys, turn tomorrow and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea."
{Num 14:25} 亚玛力人和迦南人住在谷中，明天你们要转回，从红海的路往旷野去。”
{Num 14:26} And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
{Num 14:26} 耶和华对摩西、亚伦说：
{Num 14:27} "How long shall this wicked congregation grumble against me? I have heard the grumblings of the people of Israel, which they grumble against me.
{Num 14:27} “这恶会众向我发怨言，我忍耐他们要到几时呢？以色列人向我所发的怨言，我都听见了。
{Num 14:28} Say to them, 'As I live, declares the LORD, what you have said in my hearing I will do to you:
{Num 14:28} 你们告诉他们，耶和华说：‘我指着我的永生起誓，我必要照你们达到我耳中的话待你们。
{Num 14:29} your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness, and of all your number, listed in the census from twenty years old and upward, who have grumbled against me,
{Num 14:29} 你们的尸首必倒在这旷野，并且你们中间凡被数点、从二十岁以外、向我发怨言的，
{Num 14:30} not one shall come into the land where I swore that I would make you dwell, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
{Num 14:30} 必不得进我起誓应许叫你们住的那地；惟有耶孚尼的儿子迦勒和嫩的儿子约书亚才能进去。
{Num 14:31} But your little ones, who you said would become a prey, I will bring in, and they shall know the land that you have rejected.
{Num 14:31} 但你们的妇人孩子，就是你们所说、要被掳掠的，我必把他们领进去，他们就得知你们所厌弃的那地。
{Num 14:32} But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
{Num 14:32} 至于你们，你们的尸首必倒在这旷野；
{Num 14:33} And your children shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years and shall suffer for your faithlessness, until the last of your dead bodies lies in the wilderness.
{Num 14:33} 你们的儿女必在旷野飘流四十年，担当你们淫行的罪，直到你们的尸首在旷野消灭。
{Num 14:34} According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, a year for each day, you shall bear your iniquity forty years, and you shall know my displeasure.'
{Num 14:34} 按你们窥探那地的四十日，一年顶一日，你们要担当罪孽四十年，就知道我与你们疏远了，
{Num 14:35} I, the LORD, have spoken. Surely this will I do to all this wicked congregation who are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall come to a full end, and there they shall die."
{Num 14:35} 我耶和华说过，我总要这样待这一切聚集敌我的恶会众；他们必在这旷野消灭，在这里死亡。’”
{Num 14:36} And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing up a bad report about the land--
{Num 14:36} 摩西所打发、窥探那地的人回来，报那地的恶信，叫全会众向摩西发怨言，
{Num 14:37} the men who brought up a bad report of the land--died by plague before the LORD.
{Num 14:37} 这些报恶信的人都遭瘟疫，死在耶和华面前。
{Num 14:38} Of those men who went to spy out the land, only Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive.
{Num 14:38} 其中惟有嫩的儿子约书亚和耶孚尼的儿子迦勒仍然存活。
{Num 14:39} When Moses told these words to all the people of Israel, the people mourned greatly.
{Num 14:39} 摩西将这些话告诉以色列众人，他们就甚悲哀。
{Num 14:40} And they rose early in the morning and went up to the heights of the hill country, saying, "Here we are. We will go up to the place that the LORD has promised, for we have sinned."
{Num 14:40} 清早起来，上山顶去，说：“我们在这里，我们有罪了；情愿上耶和华所应许的地方去。”
{Num 14:41} But Moses said, "Why now are you transgressing the command of the LORD, when that will not succeed?
{Num 14:41} 摩西说：“你们为何违背耶和华的命令呢？这事不能顺利了。
{Num 14:42} Do not go up, for the LORD is not among you, lest you be struck down before your enemies.
{Num 14:42} 不要上去；因为耶和华不在你们中间，恐怕你们被仇敌杀败了。
{Num 14:43} For there the Amalekites and the Canaanites are facing you, and you shall fall by the sword. Because you have turned back from following the LORD, the LORD will not be with you."
{Num 14:43} 亚玛力人和迦南人都在你们面前，你们必倒在刀下；因你们退回不跟从耶和华，所以他必不与你们同在。”
{Num 14:44} But they presumed to go up to the heights of the hill country, although neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD nor Moses departed out of the camp.
{Num 14:44} 他们却擅敢上山顶去，然而耶和华的约柜和摩西没有出营。
{Num 14:45} Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and defeated them and pursued them, even to Hormah.
{Num 14:45} 于是亚玛力人和住在那山上的迦南人都下来击打他们，把他们杀退了，直到何珥玛。
{Num 15:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 15:1}  耶和华对摩西说：
{Num 15:2}  "Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land you are to inhabit, which I am giving you,
{Num 15:2}  “你晓谕以色列人说：你们到了我所赐给你们居住的地，
{Num 15:3}  and you offer to the LORD from the herd or from the flock a food offering or a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or at your appointed feasts, to make a pleasing aroma to the LORD,
{Num 15:3}  若愿意从牛群羊群中取牛羊作火祭，献给耶和华，无论是燔祭是平安祭，为要还特许的愿，或是作甘心祭，或是逢你们节期献的，都要奉给耶和华为馨香之祭。
{Num 15:4}  then he who brings his offering shall offer to the LORD a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil;
{Num 15:4}  那献供物的就要将细面伊法十分之一，并油一欣四分之一，调和作素祭，献给耶和华。
{Num 15:5}  and you shall offer with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice, a quarter of a hin of wine for the drink offering for each lamb.
{Num 15:5}  无论是燔祭是平安祭，你要为每只绵羊羔，一同预备奠祭的酒一欣四分之一。
{Num 15:6}  Or for a ram, you shall offer for a grain offering two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil.
{Num 15:6}  为公绵羊预备细面伊法十分之二，并油一欣三分之一，调和作素祭，
{Num 15:7}  And for the drink offering you shall offer a third of a hin of wine, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
{Num 15:7}  又用酒一欣三分之一作奠祭，献给耶和华为馨香之祭。
{Num 15:8}  And when you offer a bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, to fulfill a vow or for peace offerings to the LORD,
{Num 15:8}  你预备公牛作燔祭，或是作平安祭，为要还特许的愿，或是作平安祭，献给耶和华，
{Num 15:9}  then one shall offer with the bull a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with half a hin of oil.
{Num 15:9}  就要把细面伊法十分之三，并油半欣，调和作素祭，和公牛一同献上，
{Num 15:10} And you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, as a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
{Num 15:10} 又用酒半欣作奠祭，献给耶和华为馨香的火祭。
{Num 15:11} "Thus it shall be done for each bull or ram, or for each lamb or young goat.
{Num 15:11} “献公牛、公绵羊、绵羊羔、山羊羔，每只都要这样办理。
{Num 15:12} As many as you offer, so shall you do with each one, as many as there are.
{Num 15:12} 照你们所预备的数目，按着只数都要这样办理。
{Num 15:13} Every native Israelite shall do these things in this way, in offering a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
{Num 15:13} 凡本地人将馨香的火祭献给耶和华，都要这样办理。
{Num 15:14} And if a stranger is sojourning with you, or anyone is living permanently among you, and he wishes to offer a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD, he shall do as you do.
{Num 15:14} 若有外人和你们同居，或有人世世代代住在你们中间，愿意将馨香的火祭献给耶和华，你们怎样办理，他也要照样办理。
{Num 15:15} For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you, a statute forever throughout your generations. You and the sojourner shall be alike before the LORD.
{Num 15:15} 至于会众，你们和同居的外人都归一例，作为你们世世代代永远的定例，在耶和华面前，你们怎样，寄居的也要怎样。
{Num 15:16} One law and one rule shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you."
{Num 15:16} 你们并与你们同居的外人当有一样的条例，一样的典章。”
{Num 15:17} The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 15:17} 耶和华对摩西说：
{Num 15:18} "Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land to which I bring you
{Num 15:18} “你晓谕以色列人说：你们到了我所领你们进去的那地，
{Num 15:19} and when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall present a contribution to the LORD.
{Num 15:19} 吃那地的粮食，就要把举祭献给耶和华。
{Num 15:20} Of the first of your dough you shall present a loaf as a contribution; like a contribution from the threshing floor, so shall you present it.
{Num 15:20} 你们要用初熟的麦子磨面，做饼当举祭奉献；你们举上，好像举禾场的举祭一样。
{Num 15:21} Some of the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD as a contribution throughout your generations.
{Num 15:21} 你们世世代代要用初熟的麦子磨面，当举祭献给耶和华。
{Num 15:22} "But if you sin unintentionally, and do not observe all these commandments that the LORD has spoken to Moses,
{Num 15:22} “你们有错误的时候，不守耶和华所晓谕摩西的这一切命令，
{Num 15:23} all that the LORD has commanded you by Moses, from the day that the LORD gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations,
{Num 15:23} 就是耶和华藉摩西一切所吩咐你们的，自那日以至你们的世世代代，
{Num 15:24} then if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge of the congregation, all the congregation shall offer one bull from the herd for a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the rule, and one male goat for a sin offering.
{Num 15:24} 若有误行，是会众所不知道的，后来全会众就要将一只公牛犊作燔祭，并照典章把素祭和奠祭一同献给耶和华为馨香之祭，又献一只公山羊作赎罪祭。
{Num 15:25} And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the people of Israel, and they shall be forgiven, because it was a mistake, and they have brought their offering, a food offering to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD for their mistake.
{Num 15:25} 祭司要为以色列全会众赎罪，他们就必蒙赦免，因为这是错误。他们又因自己的错误，把供物，就是向耶和华献的火祭和赎罪祭，一并奉到耶和华面前。
{Num 15:26} And all the congregation of the people of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger who sojourns among them, because the whole population was involved in the mistake.
{Num 15:26} 以色列全会众和寄居在他们中间的外人就必蒙赦免，因为这罪是百姓误犯的。
{Num 15:27} "If one person sins unintentionally, he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.
{Num 15:27} “若有一个人误犯了罪，他就要献一岁的母山羊作赎罪祭。
{Num 15:28} And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who makes a mistake, when he sins unintentionally, to make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
{Num 15:28} 那误行的人犯罪的时候，祭司要在耶和华面前为他赎罪，他就必蒙赦免。
{Num 15:29} You shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally, for him who is native among the people of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them.
{Num 15:29} 以色列中的本地人和寄居在他们中间的外人，若误行了什么事，必归一样的条例。
{Num 15:30} But the person who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native or a sojourner, reviles the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from among his people.
{Num 15:30} 但那擅敢行事的，无论是本地人是寄居的，他亵渎了耶和华，必从民中剪除。
{Num 15:31} Because he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken his commandment, that person shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be on him."
{Num 15:31} 因他藐视耶和华的言语，违背耶和华的命令，那人总要剪除；他的罪孽要归到他身上。”
{Num 15:32} While the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.
{Num 15:32} 以色列人在旷野的时候，遇见一个人在安息日捡柴。
{Num 15:33} And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation.
{Num 15:33} 遇见他捡柴的人，就把他带到摩西、亚伦并全会众那里，
{Num 15:34} They put him in custody, because it had not been made clear what should be done to him.
{Num 15:34} 将他收在监内；因为当怎样办他，还没有指明。
{Num 15:35} And the LORD said to Moses, "The man shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp."
{Num 15:35} 耶和华吩咐摩西说：“总要把那人治死；全会众要在营外用石头把他打死。”
{Num 15:36} And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Num 15:36} 于是全会众将他带到营外，用石头打死他，是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的。
{Num 15:37} The LORD said to Moses,
{Num 15:37} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 15:38} "Speak to the people of Israel, and tell them to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a cord of blue on the tassel of each corner.
{Num 15:38} “你吩咐以色列人，叫他们世世代代在衣服边上做䍁子，又在底边的䍁子上钉一根蓝细带子。
{Num 15:39} And it shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD, to do them, not to follow after your own heart and your own eyes, which you are inclined to whore after.
{Num 15:39} 你们佩带这䍁子，好叫你们看见就记念遵行耶和华一切的命令，不随从自己的心意、眼目行邪淫，像你们素常一样；
{Num 15:40} So you shall remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.
{Num 15:40} 使你们记念遵行我一切的命令，成为圣洁，归与你们的神。
{Num 15:41} I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the LORD your God."
{Num 15:41} “我是耶和华你们的神，曾把你们从埃及地领出来，要作你们的神。我是耶和华你们的神。”
{Num 16:1}  Now Korah the son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men.
{Num 16:1}  利未的曾孙、哥辖的孙子、以斯哈的儿子可拉，和流便子孙中以利押的儿子大坍、亚比兰，与比勒的儿子安，
{Num 16:2}  And they rose up before Moses, with a number of the people of Israel, 250 chiefs of the congregation, chosen from the assembly, well-known men.
{Num 16:2}  并以色列会中的二百五十个首领，就是有名望选入会中的人，在摩西面前一同起来，
{Num 16:3}  They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said to them, "You have gone too far! For all in the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?"
{Num 16:3}  聚集攻击摩西、亚伦，说：“你们擅自专权！全会众个个既是圣洁，耶和华也在他们中间，你们为什么自高，超过耶和华的会众呢？”
{Num 16:4}  When Moses heard it, he fell on his face,
{Num 16:4}  摩西听见这话就俯伏在地，
{Num 16:5}  and he said to Korah and all his company, "In the morning the LORD will show who is his, and who is holy, and will bring him near to him. The one whom he chooses he will bring near to him.
{Num 16:5}  对可拉和他一党的人说：“到了早晨，耶和华必指示谁是属他的，谁是圣洁的，就叫谁亲近他；他所拣选的是谁，必叫谁亲近他。
{Num 16:6}  Do this: take censers, Korah and all his company;
{Num 16:6}  可拉啊，你们要这样行，你和你的一党要拿香炉来。
{Num 16:7}  put fire in them and put incense on them before the LORD tomorrow, and the man whom the LORD chooses shall be the holy one. You have gone too far, sons of Levi!"
{Num 16:7}  明日，在耶和华面前，把火盛在炉中，把香放在其上。耶和华拣选谁，谁就为圣洁。你们这利未的子孙擅自专权了！”
{Num 16:8}  And Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi:
{Num 16:8}  摩西又对可拉说：“利未的子孙哪，你们听我说！
{Num 16:9}  is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do service in the tabernacle of the LORD and to stand before the congregation to minister to them,
{Num 16:9}  以色列的神从以色列会中将你们分别出来，使你们亲近他，办耶和华帐幕的事，并站在会众面前替他们当差。
{Num 16:10} and that he has brought you near him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? And would you seek the priesthood also?
{Num 16:10} 耶和华又使你和你一切弟兄利未的子孙一同亲近他，这岂为小事？你们还要求祭司的职任吗？
{Num 16:11} Therefore it is against the LORD that you and all your company have gathered together. What is Aaron that you grumble against him?"
{Num 16:11} 你和你一党的人聚集是要攻击耶和华。亚伦算什么，你们竟向他发怨言呢？”
{Num 16:12} And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and they said, "We will not come up.
{Num 16:12} 摩西打发人去召以利押的儿子大坍、亚比兰。他们说：“我们不上去！
{Num 16:13} Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also make yourself a prince over us?
{Num 16:13} 你将我们从流奶与蜜之地领上来，要在旷野杀我们，这岂为小事？你还要自立为王辖管我们吗？
{Num 16:14} Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up."
{Num 16:14} 并且你没有将我们领到流奶与蜜之地，也没有把田地和葡萄园给我们为业。难道你要剜这些人的眼睛吗？我们不上去！”
{Num 16:15} And Moses was very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not harmed one of them."
{Num 16:15} 摩西就甚发怒，对耶和华说：“求你不要享受他们的供物。我并没有夺过他们一匹驴，也没有害过他们一个人。”
{Num 16:16} And Moses said to Korah, "Be present, you and all your company, before the LORD, you and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.
{Num 16:16} 摩西对可拉说：“明天，你和你一党的人，并亚伦，都要站在耶和华面前；
{Num 16:17} And let every one of you take his censer and put incense on it, and every one of you bring before the LORD his censer, 250 censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer."
{Num 16:17} 各人要拿一个香炉，共二百五十个，把香放在上面，到耶和华面前。你和亚伦也各拿自己的香炉。”
{Num 16:18} So every man took his censer and put fire in them and laid incense on them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
{Num 16:18} 于是他们各人拿一个香炉，盛上火，加上香，同摩西、亚伦站在会幕门前。
{Num 16:19} Then Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
{Num 16:19} 可拉招聚全会众到会幕门前，要攻击摩西、亚伦；耶和华的荣光就向全会众显现。
{Num 16:20} And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
{Num 16:20} 耶和华晓谕摩西、亚伦说：
{Num 16:21} "Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment."
{Num 16:21} “你们离开这会众，我好在转眼之间把他们灭绝。”
{Num 16:22} And they fell on their faces and said, "O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?"
{Num 16:22} 摩西、亚伦就俯伏在地，说：“神，万人之灵的神啊，一人犯罪，你就要向全会众发怒吗？”
{Num 16:23} And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 16:23} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 16:24} "Say to the congregation, Get away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram."
{Num 16:24} “你吩咐会众说：‘你们离开可拉、大坍、亚比兰帐棚的四围。’”
{Num 16:25} Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
{Num 16:25} 摩西起来，往大坍、亚比兰那里去；以色列的长老也随着他去。
{Num 16:26} And he spoke to the congregation, saying, "Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be swept away with all their sins."
{Num 16:26} 他吩咐会众说：“你们离开这恶人的帐棚吧，他们的物件，什么都不可摸，恐怕你们陷在他们的罪中，与他们一同消灭。”
{Num 16:27} So they got away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.
{Num 16:27} 于是众人离开可拉、大坍、亚比兰帐棚的四围。大坍、亚比兰带着妻子、儿女、小孩子，都出来，站在自己的帐棚门口。
{Num 16:28} And Moses said, "Hereby you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been of my own accord.
{Num 16:28} 摩西说：“我行的这一切事本不是凭我自己心意行的，乃是耶和华打发我行的，必有证据使你们知道。
{Num 16:29} If these men die as all men die, or if they are visited by the fate of all mankind, then the LORD has not sent me.
{Num 16:29} 这些人死若与世人无异，或是他们所遭的与世人相同，就不是耶和华打发我来的。
{Num 16:30} But if the LORD creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised the LORD."
{Num 16:30} 倘若耶和华创作一件新事，使地开口，把他们和一切属他们的都吞下去，叫他们活活地坠落阴间，你们就明白这些人是藐视耶和华了。”
{Num 16:31} And as soon as he had finished speaking all these words, the ground under them split apart.
{Num 16:31} 摩西刚说完了这一切话，他们脚下的地就开了口，
{Num 16:32} And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the people who belonged to Korah and all their goods.
{Num 16:32} 把他们和他们的家眷，并一切属可拉的人丁、财物，都吞下去。
{Num 16:33} So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.
{Num 16:33} 这样，他们和一切属他们的，都活活地坠落阴间；地口在他们上头照旧合闭，他们就从会中灭亡。
{Num 16:34} And all Israel who were around them fled at their cry, for they said, "Lest the earth swallow us up!"
{Num 16:34} 在他们四围的以色列众人听他们呼号，就都逃跑，说：“恐怕地也把我们吞下去。”
{Num 16:35} And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men offering the incense.
{Num 16:35} 又有火从耶和华那里出来，烧灭了那献香的二百五十个人。
{Num 16:36} Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 16:36} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 16:37} "Tell Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers out of the blaze. Then scatter the fire far and wide, for they have become holy.
{Num 16:37} “你吩咐祭司亚伦的儿子以利亚撒从火中捡起那些香炉来，把火撒在别处，因为那些香炉是圣的。
{Num 16:38} As for the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, for they offered them before the LORD, and they became holy. Thus they shall be a sign to the people of Israel."
{Num 16:38} 把那些犯罪、自害己命之人的香炉，叫人锤成片子，用以包坛。那些香炉本是他们在耶和华面前献过的，所以是圣的，并且可以给以色列人作记号。”
{Num 16:39} So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had offered, and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar,
{Num 16:39} 于是祭司以利亚撒将被烧之人所献的铜香炉拿来，人就锤出来，用以包坛，
{Num 16:40} to be a reminder to the people of Israel, so that no outsider, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, should draw near to burn incense before the LORD, lest he become like Korah and his company--as the LORD said to him through Moses.
{Num 16:40} 给以色列人作纪念，使亚伦后裔之外的人不得近前来在耶和华面前烧香，免得他遭可拉和他一党所遭的。这乃是照耶和华藉着摩西所吩咐的。
{Num 16:41} But on the next day all the congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and against Aaron, saying, "You have killed the people of the LORD."
{Num 16:41} 第二天，以色列全会众都向摩西、亚伦发怨言说：“你们杀了耶和华的百姓了。”
{Num 16:42} And when the congregation had assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting. And behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
{Num 16:42} 会众聚集攻击摩西、亚伦的时候，向会幕观看，不料，有云彩遮盖了，耶和华的荣光显现。
{Num 16:43} And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,
{Num 16:43} 摩西、亚伦就来到会幕前。
{Num 16:44} and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 16:44} 耶和华吩咐摩西说：
{Num 16:45} "Get away from the midst of this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment." And they fell on their faces.
{Num 16:45} “你们离开这会众，我好在转眼之间把他们灭绝。”他们二人就俯伏于地。
{Num 16:46} And Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer, and put fire on it from off the altar and lay incense on it and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone out from the LORD; the plague has begun."
{Num 16:46} 摩西对亚伦说：“拿你的香炉，把坛上的火盛在其中，又加上香，快快带到会众那里，为他们赎罪；因为有忿怒从耶和华那里出来，瘟疫已经发作了。”
{Num 16:47} So Aaron took it as Moses said and ran into the midst of the assembly. And behold, the plague had already begun among the people. And he put on the incense and made atonement for the people.
{Num 16:47} 亚伦照着摩西所说的拿来，跑到会中，不料，瘟疫在百姓中已经发作了。他就加上香，为百姓赎罪。
{Num 16:48} And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped.
{Num 16:48} 他站在活人死人中间，瘟疫就止住了。
{Num 16:49} Now those who died in the plague were 14,700, besides those who died in the affair of Korah.
{Num 16:49} 除了因可拉事情死的以外，遭瘟疫死的，共有一万四千七百人。
{Num 16:50} And Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, when the plague was stopped.
{Num 16:50} 亚伦回到会幕门口，到摩西那里，瘟疫已经止住了。
{Num 17:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 17:1}  耶和华对摩西说：
{Num 17:2}  "Speak to the people of Israel, and get from them staffs, one for each fathers' house, from all their chiefs according to their fathers' houses, twelve staffs. Write each man's name on his staff,
{Num 17:2}  “你晓谕以色列人，从他们手下取杖，每支派一根；从他们所有的首领，按着支派，共取十二根。你要将各人的名字写在各人的杖上，
{Num 17:3}  and write Aaron's name on the staff of Levi. For there shall be one staff for the head of each fathers' house.
{Num 17:3}  并要将亚伦的名字写在利未的杖上，因为各族长必有一根杖。
{Num 17:4}  Then you shall deposit them in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
{Num 17:4}  你要把这些杖存在会幕内法柜前，就是我与你们相会之处。
{Num 17:5}  And the staff of the man whom I choose shall sprout. Thus I will make to cease from me the grumblings of the people of Israel, which they grumble against you."
{Num 17:5}  后来我所拣选的那人，他的杖必发芽。这样，我必使以色列人向你们所发的怨言止息，不再达到我耳中。”
{Num 17:6}  Moses spoke to the people of Israel. And all their chiefs gave him staffs, one for each chief, according to their fathers' houses, twelve staffs. And the staff of Aaron was among their staffs.
{Num 17:6}  于是摩西晓谕以色列人，他们的首领就把杖交给他，按着支派，每首领一根，共有十二根；亚伦的杖也在其中。
{Num 17:7}  And Moses deposited the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.
{Num 17:7}  摩西就把杖存在法柜的帐幕内，在耶和华面前。
{Num 17:8}  On the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds.
{Num 17:8}  第二天，摩西进法柜的帐幕去。谁知利未族亚伦的杖已经发了芽，生了花苞，开了花，结了熟杏。
{Num 17:9}  Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the LORD to all the people of Israel. And they looked, and each man took his staff.
{Num 17:9}  摩西就把所有的杖从耶和华面前拿出来，给以色列众人看；他们看见了，各首领就把自己的杖拿去。
{Num 17:10} And the LORD said to Moses, "Put back the staff of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebels, that you may make an end of their grumblings against me, lest they die."
{Num 17:10} 耶和华吩咐摩西说：“把亚伦的杖还放在法柜前，给这些背叛之子留作记号。这样，你就使他们向我发的怨言止息，免得他们死亡。”
{Num 17:11} Thus did Moses; as the LORD commanded him, so he did.
{Num 17:11} 摩西就这样行。耶和华怎样吩咐他，他就怎样行了。
{Num 17:12} And the people of Israel said to Moses, "Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.
{Num 17:12} 以色列人对摩西说：“我们死啦！我们灭亡啦！都灭亡啦！
{Num 17:13} Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the LORD, shall die. Are we all to perish?"
{Num 17:13} 凡挨近耶和华帐幕的是必死的。我们都要死亡吗？”
{Num 18:1}  So the LORD said to Aaron, "You and your sons and your father's house with you shall bear iniquity connected with the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear iniquity connected with your priesthood.
{Num 18:1}  耶和华对亚伦说：“你和你的儿子，并你本族的人，要一同担当干犯圣所的罪孽。你和你的儿子也要一同担当干犯祭司职任的罪孽。
{Num 18:2}  And with you bring your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may join you and minister to you while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony.
{Num 18:2}  你要带你弟兄利未人，就是你祖宗支派的人前来，使他们与你联合，服事你，只是你和你的儿子，要一同在法柜的帐幕前供职。
{Num 18:3}  They shall keep guard over you and over the whole tent, but shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary or to the altar lest they, and you, die.
{Num 18:3}  他们要守所吩咐你的，并守全帐幕，只是不可挨近圣所的器具和坛，免得他们和你们都死亡。
{Num 18:4}  They shall join you and keep guard over the tent of meeting for all the service of the tent, and no outsider shall come near you.
{Num 18:4}  他们要与你联合，也要看守会幕，办理帐幕一切的事，只是外人不可挨近你们。
{Num 18:5}  And you shall keep guard over the sanctuary and over the altar, that there may never again be wrath on the people of Israel.
{Num 18:5}  你们要看守圣所和坛，免得忿怒再临到以色列人。
{Num 18:6}  And behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the people of Israel. They are a gift to you, given to the LORD, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
{Num 18:6}  我已将你们的弟兄利未人从以色列人中拣选出来归耶和华，是给你们为赏赐的，为要办理会幕的事。
{Num 18:7}  And you and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood for all that concerns the altar and that is within the veil; and you shall serve. I give your priesthood as a gift, and any outsider who comes near shall be put to death."
{Num 18:7}  你和你的儿子要为一切属坛和幔子内的事一同守祭司的职任。你们要这样供职；我将祭司的职任给你们当作赏赐事奉我。凡挨近的外人必被治死。”
{Num 18:8}  Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, "Behold, I have given you charge of the contributions made to me, all the consecrated things of the people of Israel. I have given them to you as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual due.
{Num 18:8}  耶和华晓谕亚伦说：“我已将归我的举祭，就是以色列人一切分别为圣的物，交给你经管；因你受过膏，把这些都赐给你和你的子孙，当作永得的分。
{Num 18:9}  This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, every grain offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every guilt offering of theirs, which they render to me, shall be most holy to you and to your sons.
{Num 18:9}  以色列人归给我至圣的供物，就是一切的素祭、赎罪祭、赎愆祭，其中所有存留不经火的，都为至圣之物，要归给你和你的子孙。
{Num 18:10} In a most holy place shall you eat it. Every male may eat it; it is holy to you.
{Num 18:10} 你要拿这些当至圣物吃；凡男丁都可以吃。你当以此物为圣。
{Num 18:11} This also is yours: the contribution of their gift, all the wave offerings of the people of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.
{Num 18:11} 以色列人所献的举祭并摇祭都是你的；我已赐给你和你的儿女，当作永得的分；凡在你家中的洁净人都可以吃。
{Num 18:12} All the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the grain, the firstfruits of what they give to the LORD, I give to you.
{Num 18:12} 凡油中、新酒中、五谷中至好的，就是以色列人所献给耶和华初熟之物，我都赐给你。
{Num 18:13} The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.
{Num 18:13} 凡从他们地上所带来给耶和华初熟之物也都要归与你。你家中的洁净人都可以吃。
{Num 18:14} Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
{Num 18:14} 以色列中一切永献的都必归与你。
{Num 18:15} Everything that opens the womb of all flesh, whether man or beast, which they offer to the LORD, shall be yours. Nevertheless, the firstborn of man you shall redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem.
{Num 18:15} 他们所有奉给耶和华的，连人带牲畜，凡头生的，都要归给你；只是人头生的，总要赎出来；不洁净牲畜头生的，也要赎出来。
{Num 18:16} And their redemption price (at a month old you shall redeem them) you shall fix at five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
{Num 18:16} 其中在一月之外所当赎的，要照你所估定的价，按圣所的平，用银子五舍客勒赎出来（一舍客勒是二十季拉）。
{Num 18:17} But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall burn their fat as a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
{Num 18:17} 只是头生的牛，或是头生的绵羊和山羊，必不可赎，都是圣的，要把他的血洒在坛上，把他的脂油焚烧，当作馨香的火祭献给耶和华。
{Num 18:18} But their flesh shall be yours, as the breast that is waved and as the right thigh are yours.
{Num 18:18} 他的肉必归你，像被摇的胸、被举的右腿归你一样。
{Num 18:19} All the holy contributions that the people of Israel present to the LORD I give to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due. It is a covenant of salt forever before the LORD for you and for your offspring with you."
{Num 18:19} 凡以色列人所献给耶和华圣物中的举祭，我都赐给你和你的儿女，当作永得的分。这是给你和你的后裔、在耶和华面前作为永远的盐约（盐就是不废坏的意思）。”
{Num 18:20} And the LORD said to Aaron, "You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the people of Israel.
{Num 18:20} 耶和华对亚伦说：“你在以色列人的境内不可有产业，在他们中间也不可有分。我就是你的分，是你的产业。”
{Num 18:21} "To the Levites I have given every tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service that they do, their service in the tent of meeting,
{Num 18:21} “凡以色列中出产的十分之一，我已赐给利未的子孙为业；因他们所办的是会幕的事，所以赐给他们为酬他们的劳。
{Num 18:22} so that the people of Israel do not come near the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin and die.
{Num 18:22} 从今以后，以色列人不可挨近会幕，免得他们担罪而死。
{Num 18:23} But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the people of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
{Num 18:23} 惟独利未人要办会幕的事，担当罪孽；这要作你们世世代代永远的定例。他们在以色列人中不可有产业；
{Num 18:24} For the tithe of the people of Israel, which they present as a contribution to the LORD, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance. Therefore I have said of them that they shall have no inheritance among the people of Israel."
{Num 18:24} 因为以色列人中出产的十分之一，就是献给耶和华为举祭的，我已赐给利未人为业。所以我对他们说：‘在以色列人中不可有产业。’”
{Num 18:25} And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 18:25} 耶和华吩咐摩西说：
{Num 18:26} "Moreover, you shall speak and say to the Levites, 'When you take from the people of Israel the tithe that I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall present a contribution from it to the LORD, a tithe of the tithe.
{Num 18:26} “你晓谕利未人说：你们从以色列人中所取的十分之一，就是我给你们为业的，要再从那十分之一中取十分之一作为举祭献给耶和华，
{Num 18:27} And your contribution shall be counted to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the winepress.
{Num 18:27} 这举祭要算为你们场上的谷，又如满酒榨的酒。
{Num 18:28} So you shall also present a contribution to the LORD from all your tithes, which you receive from the people of Israel. And from it you shall give the LORD's contribution to Aaron the priest.
{Num 18:28} 这样，你们从以色列人中所得的十分之一也要作举祭献给耶和华，从这十分之一中，将所献给耶和华的举祭归给祭司亚伦。
{Num 18:29} Out of all the gifts to you, you shall present every contribution due to the LORD; from each its best part is to be dedicated.'
{Num 18:29} 奉给你们的一切礼物，要从其中将至好的，就是分别为圣的，献给耶和华为举祭。
{Num 18:30} Therefore you shall say to them, 'When you have offered from it the best of it, then the rest shall be counted to the Levites as produce of the threshing floor, and as produce of the winepress.
{Num 18:30} 所以你要对利未人说：你们从其中将至好的举起，这就算为你们场上的粮，又如酒榨的酒。
{Num 18:31} And you may eat it in any place, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
{Num 18:31} 你们和你们家属随处可以吃；这原是你们的赏赐，是酬你们在会幕里办事的劳。
{Num 18:32} And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have contributed the best of it. But you shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, lest you die.'"
{Num 18:32} 你们从其中将至好的举起，就不至因这物担罪。你们不可亵渎以色列人的圣物，免得死亡。”
{Num 19:1}  Now the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
{Num 19:1}  耶和华晓谕摩西、亚伦说：
{Num 19:2}  "This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded: Tell the people of Israel to bring you a red heifer without defect, in which there is no blemish, and on which a yoke has never come.
{Num 19:2}  “耶和华命定律法中的一条律例乃是这样说：你要吩咐以色列人，把一只没有残疾、未曾负轭、纯红的母牛牵到你这里来，
{Num 19:3}  And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and it shall be taken outside the camp and slaughtered before him.
{Num 19:3}  交给祭司以利亚撒；他必牵到营外，人就把牛宰在他面前。
{Num 19:4}  And Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.
{Num 19:4}  祭司以利亚撒要用指头蘸这牛的血，向会幕前面弹七次。
{Num 19:5}  And the heifer shall be burned in his sight. Its skin, its flesh, and its blood, with its dung, shall be burned.
{Num 19:5}  人要在他眼前把这母牛焚烧；牛的皮、肉、血、粪都要焚烧。
{Num 19:6}  And the priest shall take cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet yarn, and throw them into the fire burning the heifer.
{Num 19:6}  祭司要把香柏木、牛膝草、朱红色线都丢在烧牛的火中。
{Num 19:7}  Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. But the priest shall be unclean until evening.
{Num 19:7}  祭司必不洁净到晚上，要洗衣服，用水洗身，然后可以进营。
{Num 19:8}  The one who burns the heifer shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water and shall be unclean until evening.
{Num 19:8}  烧牛的人必不洁净到晚上，也要洗衣服，用水洗身。
{Num 19:9}  And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place. And they shall be kept for the water for impurity for the congregation of the people of Israel; it is a sin offering.
{Num 19:9}  必有一个洁净的人收起母牛的灰，存在营外洁净的地方，为以色列会众调做除污秽的水。这本是除罪的。
{Num 19:10} And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. And this shall be a perpetual statute for the people of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them.
{Num 19:10} 收起母牛灰的人必不洁净到晚上，要洗衣服。这要给以色列人和寄居在他们中间的外人作为永远的定例。”
{Num 19:11} "Whoever touches the dead body of any person shall be unclean seven days.
{Num 19:11} “摸了人死尸的，就必七天不洁净。
{Num 19:12} He shall cleanse himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be clean. But if he does not cleanse himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not become clean.
{Num 19:12} 那人到第三天要用这除污秽的水洁净自己，第七天就洁净了。他若在第三天不洁净自己，第七天就不洁净了。
{Num 19:13} Whoever touches a dead person, the body of anyone who has died, and does not cleanse himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not thrown on him, he shall be unclean. His uncleanness is still on him.
{Num 19:13} 凡摸了人死尸、不洁净自己的，就玷污了耶和华的帐幕，这人必从以色列中剪除；因为那除污秽的水没有洒在他身上，他就为不洁净，污秽还在他身上。
{Num 19:14} "This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean seven days.
{Num 19:14} “人死在帐棚里的条例乃是这样：凡进那帐棚的，和一切在帐棚里的，都必七天不洁净。
{Num 19:15} And every open vessel that has no cover fastened on it is unclean.
{Num 19:15} 凡敞口的器皿，就是没有扎上盖的，也是不洁净。
{Num 19:16} Whoever in the open field touches someone who was killed with a sword or who died naturally, or touches a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
{Num 19:16} 无论何人在田野里摸了被刀杀的，或是尸首，或是人的骨头，或是坟墓，就要七天不洁净。
{Num 19:17} For the unclean they shall take some ashes of the burnt sin offering, and fresh water shall be added in a vessel.
{Num 19:17} 要为这不洁净的人拿些烧成的除罪灰放在器皿里，倒上活水。
{Num 19:18} Then a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there and on whoever touched the bone, or the slain or the dead or the grave.
{Num 19:18} 必当有一个洁净的人拿牛膝草蘸在这水中，把水洒在帐棚上，和一切器皿并帐棚内的众人身上，又洒在摸了骨头，或摸了被杀的，或摸了自死的，或摸了坟墓的那人身上。
{Num 19:19} And the clean person shall sprinkle it on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day. Thus on the seventh day he shall cleanse him, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and at evening he shall be clean.
{Num 19:19} 第三天和第七天，洁净的人要洒水在不洁净的人身上，第七天就使他成为洁净。那人要洗衣服，用水洗澡，到晚上就洁净了。
{Num 19:20} "If the man who is unclean does not cleanse himself, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, since he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. Because the water for impurity has not been thrown on him, he is unclean.
{Num 19:20} “但那污秽而不洁净自己的，要将他从会中剪除，因为他玷污了耶和华的圣所。除污秽的水没有洒在他身上，他是不洁净的。
{Num 19:21} And it shall be a statute forever for them. The one who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and the one who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.
{Num 19:21} 这要给你们作为永远的定例。并且那洒除污秽水的人要洗衣服。凡摸除污秽水的，必不洁净到晚上。
{Num 19:22} And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean, and anyone who touches it shall be unclean until evening."
{Num 19:22} 不洁净人所摸的一切物就不洁净；摸了这物的人必不洁净到晚上。”
{Num 20:1}  And the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh. And Miriam died there and was buried there.
{Num 20:1}  正月间，以色列全会众到了寻的旷野，就住在加低斯。米利暗死在那里，就葬在那里。
{Num 20:2}  Now there was no water for the congregation. And they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
{Num 20:2}  会众没有水喝，就聚集攻击摩西、亚伦。
{Num 20:3}  And the people quarreled with Moses and said, "Would that we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD!
{Num 20:3}  百姓向摩西争闹说：“我们的弟兄曾死在耶和华面前，我们恨不得与他们同死。
{Num 20:4}  Why have you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, that we should die here, both we and our cattle?
{Num 20:4}  你们为何把耶和华的会众领到这旷野、使我们和牲畜都死在这里呢？
{Num 20:5}  And why have you made us come up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It is no place for grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, and there is no water to drink."
{Num 20:5}  你们为何逼着我们出埃及、领我们到这坏地方呢？这地方不好撒种，也没有无花果树、葡萄树、石榴树，又没有水喝。”
{Num 20:6}  Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them,
{Num 20:6}  摩西、亚伦离开会众，到会幕门口，俯伏在地；耶和华的荣光向他们显现。
{Num 20:7}  and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 20:7}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 20:8}  "Take the staff, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water. So you shall bring water out of the rock for them and give drink to the congregation and their cattle."
{Num 20:8}  “你拿着杖去，和你的哥哥亚伦招聚会众，在他们眼前吩咐磐石发出水来，水就从磐石流出，给会众和他们的牲畜喝。”
{Num 20:9}  And Moses took the staff from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
{Num 20:9}  于是摩西照耶和华所吩咐的，从耶和华面前取了杖去。
{Num 20:10} Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels: shall we bring water for you out of this rock?"
{Num 20:10} 摩西、亚伦就招聚会众到磐石前。摩西说：“你们这些背叛的人听我说：我为你们使水从这磐石中流出来吗？”
{Num 20:11} And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice, and water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock.
{Num 20:11} 摩西举手，用杖击打磐石两下，就有许多水流出来，会众和他们的牲畜都喝了。
{Num 20:12} And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them."
{Num 20:12} 耶和华对摩西、亚伦说：“因为你们不信我，不在以色列人眼前尊我为圣，所以你们必不得领这会众进我所赐给他们的地去。”
{Num 20:13} These are the waters of Meribah, where the people of Israel quarreled with the LORD, and through them he showed himself holy.
{Num 20:13} 这水名叫米利巴水（米利巴就是争闹的意思），是因以色列人向耶和华争闹，耶和华就在他们面前显为圣。
{Num 20:14} Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: "Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardship that we have met:
{Num 20:14} 摩西从加低斯差遣使者去见以东王，说：“你的弟兄以色列人这样说：‘我们所遭遇的一切艰难，
{Num 20:15} how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time. And the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our fathers.
{Num 20:15} 就是我们的列祖下到埃及，我们在埃及久住；埃及人恶待我们的列祖和我们，
{Num 20:16} And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. And here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory.
{Num 20:16} 我们哀求耶和华的时候，他听了我们的声音，差遣使者把我们从埃及领出来。这事你都知道。如今，我们在你边界上的城加低斯。
{Num 20:17} Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, or drink water from a well. We will go along the King's Highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory."
{Num 20:17} 求你容我们从你的地经过。我们不走田间和葡萄园，也不喝井里的水，只走大道（原文作王道），不偏左右，直到过了你的境界。’”
{Num 20:18} But Edom said to him, "You shall not pass through, lest I come out with the sword against you."
{Num 20:18} 以东王说：“你不可从我的地经过，免得我带刀出去攻击你。”
{Num 20:19} And the people of Israel said to him, "We will go up by the highway, and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then I will pay for it. Let me only pass through on foot, nothing more."
{Num 20:19} 以色列人说：“我们要走大道上去；我们和牲畜若喝你的水，必给你价值。不求别的，只求你容我们步行过去。”
{Num 20:20} But he said, "You shall not pass through." And Edom came out against them with a large army and with a strong force.
{Num 20:20} 以东王说：“你们不可经过！”就率领许多人出来，要用强硬的手攻击以色列人。
{Num 20:21} Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, so Israel turned away from him.
{Num 20:21} 这样，以东王不肯容以色列人从他的境界过去。于是他们转去，离开他。
{Num 20:22} And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
{Num 20:22} 以色列全会众从加低斯起行，到了何珥山。
{Num 20:23} And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom,
{Num 20:23} 耶和华在附近以东边界的何珥山上晓谕摩西、亚伦说：
{Num 20:24} "Let Aaron be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land that I have given to the people of Israel, because you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.
{Num 20:24} “亚伦要归到他列祖（原文作本民）那里。他必不得入我所赐给以色列人的地；因为在米利巴水，你们违背了我的命。
{Num 20:25} Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to Mount Hor.
{Num 20:25} 你带亚伦和他的儿子以利亚撒上何珥山，
{Num 20:26} And strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron shall be gathered to his people and shall die there."
{Num 20:26} 把亚伦的圣衣脱下来，给他的儿子以利亚撒穿上；亚伦必死在那里，归他列祖。”
{Num 20:27} Moses did as the LORD commanded. And they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
{Num 20:27} 摩西就照耶和华所吩咐的行。三人当着会众的眼前上了何珥山。
{Num 20:28} And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
{Num 20:28} 摩西把亚伦的圣衣脱下来，给他的儿子以利亚撒穿上，亚伦就死在山顶那里。于是摩西和以利亚撒下了山。
{Num 20:29} And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had perished, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.
{Num 20:29} 全会众，就是以色列全家，见亚伦已经死了，便都为亚伦哀哭了三十天。
{Num 21:1}  When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negeb, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.
{Num 21:1}  住南地的迦南人亚拉得王，听说以色列人从亚他林路来，就和以色列人争战，掳了他们几个人。
{Num 21:2}  And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD and said, "If you will indeed give this people into my hand, then I will devote their cities to destruction."
{Num 21:2}  以色列人向耶和华发愿说：“你若将这民交付我手，我就把他们的城邑尽行毁灭。”
{Num 21:3}  And the LORD heeded the voice of Israel and gave over the Canaanites, and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. So the name of the place was called Hormah.
{Num 21:3}  耶和华应允了以色列人，把迦南人交付他们，他们就把迦南人和迦南人的城邑尽行毁灭。那地方的名便叫何珥玛（就是毁灭的意思）。
{Num 21:4}  From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way.
{Num 21:4}  他们从何珥山起行，往红海那条路走，要绕过以东地。百姓因这路难行，心中甚是烦躁，
{Num 21:5}  And the people spoke against God and against Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food."
{Num 21:5}  就怨渎神和摩西说：“你们为什么把我们从埃及领出来、使我们死在旷野呢？这里没有粮，没有水，我们的心厌恶这淡薄的食物。”
{Num 21:6}  Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.
{Num 21:6}  于是耶和华使火蛇进入百姓中间，蛇就咬他们。以色列人中死了许多。
{Num 21:7}  And the people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us." So Moses prayed for the people.
{Num 21:7}  百姓到摩西那里，说：“我们怨渎耶和华和你，有罪了。求你祷告耶和华，叫这些蛇离开我们。”于是摩西为百姓祷告。
{Num 21:8}  And the LORD said to Moses, "Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live."
{Num 21:8}  耶和华对摩西说：“你制造一条火蛇，挂在杆子上；凡被咬的，一望这蛇，就必得活。”
{Num 21:9}  So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.
{Num 21:9}  摩西便制造一条铜蛇，挂在杆子上；凡被蛇咬的，一望这铜蛇就活了。
{Num 21:10} And the people of Israel set out and camped in Oboth.
{Num 21:10} 以色列人起行，安营在阿伯。
{Num 21:11} And they set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness that is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise.
{Num 21:11} 又从阿伯起行，安营在以耶亚巴琳，与摩押相对的旷野，向日出之地。
{Num 21:12} From there they set out and camped in the Valley of Zered.
{Num 21:12} 从那里起行，安营在撒烈谷。
{Num 21:13} From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
{Num 21:13} 从那里起行，安营在亚嫩河那边。这亚嫩河是在旷野，从亚摩利的境界流出来的；原来亚嫩河是摩押的边界，在摩押和亚摩利人搭界的地方。
{Num 21:14} Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, "Waheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon,
{Num 21:14} 所以耶和华的战记上说：“苏法的哇哈伯与亚嫩河的谷，
{Num 21:15} and the slope of the valleys that extends to the seat of Ar, and leans to the border of Moab."
{Num 21:15} 并向亚珥城众谷的下坡，是靠近摩押的境界。”
{Num 21:16} And from there they continued to Beer; that is the well of which the LORD said to Moses, "Gather the people together, so that I may give them water."
{Num 21:16} 以色列人从那里起行，到了比珥（就是井的意思）。从前耶和华吩咐摩西说：“招聚百姓，我好给他们水喝”，说的就是这井。
{Num 21:17} Then Israel sang this song: "Spring up, O well!--Sing to it!--
{Num 21:17} 当时，以色列人唱歌说：井啊，涌上水来！你们要向这井歌唱。
{Num 21:18} the well that the princes made, that the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter and with their staffs." And from the wilderness they went on to Mattanah,
{Num 21:18} 这井是首领和民中的尊贵人用圭用杖所挖所掘的。以色列人从旷野往玛他拿去，
{Num 21:19} and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
{Num 21:19} 从玛他拿到拿哈列，从拿哈列到巴末，
{Num 21:20} and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah that looks down on the desert.
{Num 21:20} 从巴末到摩押地的谷，又到那下望旷野之毗斯迦的山顶。
{Num 21:21} Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
{Num 21:21} 以色列人差遣使者去见亚摩利人的王西宏，说：
{Num 21:22} "Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard. We will not drink the water of a well. We will go by the King's Highway until we have passed through your territory."
{Num 21:22} “求你容我们从你的地经过；我们不偏入田间和葡萄园，也不喝井里的水，只走大道（原文作王道），直到过了你的境界。”
{Num 21:23} But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered all his people together and went out against Israel to the wilderness and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.
{Num 21:23} 西宏不容以色列人从他的境界经过，就招聚他的众民出到旷野，要攻击以色列人，到了雅杂与以色列人争战。
{Num 21:24} And Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strong.
{Num 21:24} 以色列人用刀杀了他，得了他的地，从亚嫩河到雅博河，直到亚扪人的境界，因为亚扪人的境界多有坚垒。
{Num 21:25} And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
{Num 21:25} 以色列人夺取这一切的城邑，也住亚摩利人的城邑，就是希实本与希实本的一切乡村。
{Num 21:26} For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon.
{Num 21:26} 这希实本是亚摩利王西宏的京城；西宏曾与摩押的先王争战，从他手中夺取了全地，直到亚嫩河。
{Num 21:27} Therefore the ballad singers say, "Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be established.
{Num 21:27} 所以那些作诗歌的说：你们来到希实本；愿西宏的城被修造，被建立。
{Num 21:28} For fire came out from Heshbon, flame from the city of Sihon. It devoured Ar of Moab, and swallowed the heights of the Arnon.
{Num 21:28} 因为有火从希实本发出，有火焰出于西宏的城，烧尽摩押的亚珥和亚嫩河邱坛的祭司（祭司原文作主）。
{Num 21:29} Woe to you, O Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh! He has made his sons fugitives, and his daughters captives, to an Amorite king, Sihon.
{Num 21:29} 摩押啊，你有祸了！基抹的民哪，你们灭亡了！基抹的男子逃奔，女子被掳，交付亚摩利的王西宏。
{Num 21:30} So we overthrew them; Heshbon, as far as Dibon, perished; and we laid waste as far as Nophah; fire spread as far as Medeba."
{Num 21:30} 我们射了他们；希实本直到底本尽皆毁灭。我们使地变成荒场，直到挪法；这挪法直延到米底巴。
{Num 21:31} Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
{Num 21:31} 这样，以色列人就住在亚摩利人之地。
{Num 21:32} And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.
{Num 21:32} 摩西打发人去窥探雅谢，以色列人就占了雅谢的镇市，赶出那里的亚摩利人。
{Num 21:33} Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
{Num 21:33} 以色列人转回，向巴珊去。巴珊王噩和他的众民都出来，在以得来与他们交战。
{Num 21:34} But the LORD said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people, and his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
{Num 21:34} 耶和华对摩西说：“不要怕他！因我已将他和他的众民，并他的地，都交在你手中；你要待他像从前待住希实本的亚摩利王西宏一般。”
{Num 21:35} So they defeated him and his sons and all his people, until he had no survivor left. And they possessed his land.
{Num 21:35} 于是他们杀了他和他的众子，并他的众民，没有留下一个，就得了他的地。
{Num 22:1}  Then the people of Israel set out and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
{Num 22:1}  以色列人起行，在摩押平原、约但河东，对着耶利哥安营。
{Num 22:2}  And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
{Num 22:2}  以色列人向亚摩利人所行的一切事，西拨的儿子巴勒都看见了。
{Num 22:3}  And Moab was in great dread of the people, because they were many. Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel.
{Num 22:3}  摩押人因以色列民甚多，就大大惧怕，心内忧急，
{Num 22:4}  And Moab said to the elders of Midian, "This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field." So Balak the son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,
{Num 22:4}  对米甸的长老说：“现在这众人要把我们四围所有的一概舔尽，就如牛舔尽田间的草一般。”那时西拨的儿子巴勒作摩押王。
{Num 22:5}  sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the people of Amaw, to call him, saying, "Behold, a people has come out of Egypt. They cover the face of the earth, and they are dwelling opposite me.
{Num 22:5}  他差遣使者往大河边的毗夺去，到比珥的儿子巴兰本乡那里，召巴兰来，说：“有一宗民从埃及出来，遮满地面，与我对居。
{Num 22:6}  Come now, curse this people for me, since they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land, for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."
{Num 22:6}  这民比我强盛，现在求你来为我咒诅他们，或者我能得胜，攻打他们，赶出此地。因为我知道，你为谁祝福，谁就得福；你咒诅谁，谁就受咒诅。”
{Num 22:7}  So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand. And they came to Balaam and gave him Balak's message.
{Num 22:7}  摩押的长老和米甸的长老手里拿着卦金，到了巴兰那里，将巴勒的话都告诉了他。
{Num 22:8}  And he said to them, "Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as the LORD speaks to me." So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
{Num 22:8}  巴兰说：“你们今夜在这里住宿，我必照耶和华所晓谕我的回报你们。”摩押的使臣就在巴兰那里住下了。
{Num 22:9}  And God came to Balaam and said, "Who are these men with you?"
{Num 22:9}  神临到巴兰那里，说：“在你这里的人都是谁？”
{Num 22:10} And Balaam said to God, "Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,
{Num 22:10} 巴兰回答说：“是摩押王西拨的儿子巴勒打发人到我这里来，说：
{Num 22:11} 'Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and it covers the face of the earth. Now come, curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out.'"
{Num 22:11} ‘从埃及出来的民遮满地面，你来为我咒诅他们，或者我能与他们争战，把他们赶出去。’”
{Num 22:12} God said to Balaam, "You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed."
{Num 22:12} 神对巴兰说：“你不可同他们去，也不可咒诅那民，因为那民是蒙福的。”
{Num 22:13} So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, "Go to your own land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you."
{Num 22:13} 巴兰早晨起来，对巴勒的使臣说：“你们回本地去吧，因为耶和华不容我和你们同去。”
{Num 22:14} So the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak and said, "Balaam refuses to come with us."
{Num 22:14} 摩押的使臣就起来，回巴勒那里去，说：“巴兰不肯和我们同来。”
{Num 22:15} Once again Balak sent princes, more in number and more honorable than these.
{Num 22:15} 巴勒又差遣使臣，比先前的又多又尊贵。
{Num 22:16} And they came to Balaam and said to him, "Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: 'Let nothing hinder you from coming to me,
{Num 22:16} 他们到了巴兰那里，对他说：“西拨的儿子巴勒这样说：‘求你不容什么事拦阻你不到我这里来，
{Num 22:17} for I will surely do you great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Come, curse this people for me.'"
{Num 22:17} 因为我必使你得极大的尊荣。你向我要什么，我就给你什么；只求你来为我咒诅这民。’”
{Num 22:18} But Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, "Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the LORD my God to do less or more.
{Num 22:18} 巴兰回答巴勒的臣仆说：“巴勒就是将他满屋的金银给我，我行大事小事也不得越过耶和华我神的命。
{Num 22:19} So you, too, please stay here tonight, that I may know what more the LORD will say to me."
{Num 22:19} 现在我请你们今夜在这里住宿，等我得知耶和华还要对我说什么。”
{Num 22:20} And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, "If the men have come to call you, rise, go with them; but only do what I tell you."
{Num 22:20} 当夜，神临到巴兰那里，说：“这些人若来召你，你就起来同他们去，你只要遵行我对你所说的话。”
{Num 22:21} So Balaam rose in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.
{Num 22:21} 巴兰早晨起来，备上驴，和摩押的使臣一同去了。
{Num 22:22} But God's anger was kindled because he went, and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the way as his adversary. Now he was riding on the donkey, and his two servants were with him.
{Num 22:22} 神因他去就发了怒；耶和华的使者站在路上敌挡他。他骑着驴，有两个仆人跟随他。
{Num 22:23} And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand. And the donkey turned aside out of the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the road.
{Num 22:23} 驴看见耶和华的使者站在路上，手里有拔出来的刀，就从路上跨进田间，巴兰便打驴，要叫他回转上路。
{Num 22:24} Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on either side.
{Num 22:24} 耶和华的使者就站在葡萄园的窄路上；这边有墙，那边也有墙。
{Num 22:25} And when the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pushed against the wall and pressed Balaam's foot against the wall. So he struck her again.
{Num 22:25} 驴看见耶和华的使者，就贴靠墙，将巴兰的脚挤伤了；巴兰又打驴。
{Num 22:26} Then the angel of the LORD went ahead and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.
{Num 22:26} 耶和华的使者又往前去，站在狭窄之处，左右都没有转折的地方。
{Num 22:27} When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam. And Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
{Num 22:27} 驴看见耶和华的使者，就卧在巴兰底下，巴兰发怒，用杖打驴。
{Num 22:28} Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"
{Num 22:28} 耶和华叫驴开口，对巴兰说：“我向你行了什么，你竟打我这三次呢？”
{Num 22:29} And Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you."
{Num 22:29} 巴兰对驴说：“因为你戏弄我，我恨不能手中有刀，把你杀了。”
{Num 22:30} And the donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Is it my habit to treat you this way?" And he said, "No."
{Num 22:30} 驴对巴兰说：“我不是你从小时直到今日所骑的驴吗？我素常向你这样行过吗？”巴兰说：“没有。”
{Num 22:31} Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed down and fell on his face.
{Num 22:31} 当时，耶和华使巴兰的眼目明亮，他就看见耶和华的使者站在路上，手里有拔出来的刀，巴兰便低头俯伏在地。
{Num 22:32} And the angel of the LORD said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you because your way is perverse before me.
{Num 22:32} 耶和华的使者对他说：“你为何这三次打你的驴呢？我出来敌挡你，因你所行的，在我面前偏僻。
{Num 22:33} The donkey saw me and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let her live."
{Num 22:33} 驴看见我就三次从我面前偏过去；驴若没有偏过去，我早把你杀了，留他存活。”
{Num 22:34} Then Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood in the road against me. Now therefore, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back."
{Num 22:34} 巴兰对耶和华的使者说：“我有罪了。我不知道你站在路上阻挡我；你若不喜欢我去，我就转回。”
{Num 22:35} And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only the word that I tell you." So Balaam went on with the princes of Balak.
{Num 22:35} 耶和华的使者对巴兰说：“你同这些人去吧！你只要说我对你说的话。”于是巴兰同着巴勒的使臣去了。
{Num 22:36} When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, on the border formed by the Arnon, at the extremity of the border.
{Num 22:36} 巴勒听见巴兰来了，就往摩押京城去迎接他；这城是在边界上，在亚嫩河旁。
{Num 22:37} And Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?"
{Num 22:37} 巴勒对巴兰说：“我不是急急地打发人到你那里去召你吗？你为何不到我这里来呢？我岂不能使你得尊荣吗？”
{Num 22:38} Balaam said to Balak, "Behold, I have come to you! Have I now any power of my own to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that must I speak."
{Num 22:38} 巴兰说：“我已经到你这里来了！现在我岂能擅自说什么呢？神将什么话传给我，我就说什么。
{Num 22:39} Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
{Num 22:39} 巴兰和巴勒同行，来到基列胡琐。
{Num 22:40} And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent for Balaam and for the princes who were with him.
{Num 22:40} 巴勒宰了（原文作献）牛羊，送给巴兰和陪伴的使臣。
{Num 22:41} And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw a fraction of the people.
{Num 22:41} 到了早晨，巴勒领巴兰到巴力的高处；巴兰从那里观看以色列营的边界。
{Num 23:1}  And Balaam said to Balak, "Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams."
{Num 23:1}  巴兰对巴勒说：“你在这里给我筑七座坛，为我预备七只公牛，七只公羊。”
{Num 23:2}  Balak did as Balaam had said. And Balak and Balaam offered on each altar a bull and a ram.
{Num 23:2}  巴勒照巴兰的话行了。巴勒和巴兰在每座坛上献一只公牛，一只公羊。
{Num 23:3}  And Balaam said to Balak, "Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell you." And he went to a bare height,
{Num 23:3}  巴兰对巴勒说：“你站在你的燔祭旁边，我且往前去，或者耶和华来迎见我。他指示我什么，我必告诉你。”于是巴兰上一净光的高处。
{Num 23:4}  and God met Balaam. And Balaam said to him, "I have arranged the seven altars and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram."
{Num 23:4}  神迎见巴兰；巴兰说：“我预备了七座坛，在每座坛上献了一只公牛，一只公羊。”
{Num 23:5}  And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, "Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak."
{Num 23:5}  耶和华将话传给巴兰，又说：“你回到巴勒那里，要如此如此说。”
{Num 23:6}  And he returned to him, and behold, he and all the princes of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering.
{Num 23:6}  他就回到巴勒那里，见他同摩押的使臣都站在燔祭旁边。
{Num 23:7}  And Balaam took up his discourse and said, "From Aram Balak has brought me, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains: 'Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, denounce Israel!'
{Num 23:7}  巴兰便题起诗歌说：巴勒引我出亚兰，摩押王引我出东山，说：来啊，为我咒诅雅各；来啊，怒骂以色列。
{Num 23:8}  How can I curse whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce whom the LORD has not denounced?
{Num 23:8}  神没有咒诅的，我焉能咒诅？耶和华没有怒骂的，我焉能怒骂？
{Num 23:9}  For from the top of the crags I see him, from the hills I behold him; behold, a people dwelling alone, and not counting itself among the nations!
{Num 23:9}  我从高峰看他，从小山望他；这是独居的民，不列在万民中。
{Num 23:10} Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, and let my end be like his!"
{Num 23:10} 谁能数点雅各的尘土？谁能计算以色列的四分之一？我愿如义人之死而死；我愿如义人之终而终。
{Num 23:11} And Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have done nothing but bless them."
{Num 23:11} 巴勒对巴兰说：“你向我做的是什么事呢？我领你来咒诅我的仇敌，不料，你竟为他们祝福。”
{Num 23:12} And he answered and said, "Must I not take care to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?"
{Num 23:12} 他回答说：“耶和华传给我的话，我能不谨慎传说吗？”
{Num 23:13} And Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place, from which you may see them. You shall see only a fraction of them and shall not see them all. Then curse them for me from there."
{Num 23:13} 巴勒说：“求你同我往别处去，在那里可以看见他们；你不能全看见，只能看见他们边界上的人。在那里要为我咒诅他们。”
{Num 23:14} And he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
{Num 23:14} 于是领巴兰到了琐腓田，上了毗斯迦山顶，筑了七座坛；每座坛上献一只公牛，一只公羊。
{Num 23:15} Balaam said to Balak, "Stand here beside your burnt offering, while I meet the LORD over there."
{Num 23:15} 巴兰对巴勒说：“你站在这燔祭旁边，等我往那边去迎见耶和华。”
{Num 23:16} And the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, "Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak."
{Num 23:16} 耶和华临到巴兰那里，将话传给他；又说：“你回到巴勒那里，要如此如此说。”
{Num 23:17} And he came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, "What has the LORD spoken?"
{Num 23:17} 他就回到巴勒那里，见他站在燔祭旁边；摩押的使臣也和他在一处。巴勒问他说：“耶和华说了什么话呢？”
{Num 23:18} And Balaam took up his discourse and said, "Rise, Balak, and hear; give ear to me, O son of Zippor:
{Num 23:18} 巴兰就题诗歌说：巴勒，你起来听；西拨的儿子，你听我言。
{Num 23:19} God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?
{Num 23:19} 神非人，必不至说谎，也非人子，必不至后悔。他说话岂不照着行呢？他发言岂不要成就呢？
{Num 23:20} Behold, I received a command to bless: he has blessed, and I cannot revoke it.
{Num 23:20} 我奉命祝福；神也曾赐福，此事我不能翻转。
{Num 23:21} He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob, nor has he seen trouble in Israel. The LORD their God is with them, and the shout of a king is among them.
{Num 23:21} 他未见雅各中有罪孽，也未见以色列中有奸恶。耶和华他的神和他同在；有欢呼王的声音在他们中间。
{Num 23:22} God brings them out of Egypt and is for them like the horns of the wild ox.
{Num 23:22} 神领他们出埃及；他们似乎有野牛之力。
{Num 23:23} For there is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel; now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, 'What has God wrought!'
{Num 23:23} 断没有法术可以害雅各，也没有占卜可以害以色列。现在必有人论及雅各，就是论及以色列说：神为他行了何等的大事！
{Num 23:24} Behold, a people! As a lioness it rises up and as a lion it lifts itself; it does not lie down until it has devoured the prey and drunk the blood of the slain."
{Num 23:24} 这民起来，彷佛母狮，挺身，好像公狮，未曾吃野食，未曾喝被伤者之血，决不躺卧。
{Num 23:25} And Balak said to Balaam, "Do not curse them at all, and do not bless them at all."
{Num 23:25} 巴勒对巴兰说：“你一点不要咒诅他们，也不要为他们祝福。”
{Num 23:26} But Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not tell you, 'All that the LORD says, that I must do'?"
{Num 23:26} 巴兰回答巴勒说：“我岂不是告诉你说‘凡耶和华所说的，我必须遵行’吗？”
{Num 23:27} And Balak said to Balaam, "Come now, I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there."
{Num 23:27} 巴勒对巴兰说：“来吧，我领你往别处去，或者神喜欢你在那里为我咒诅他们。”
{Num 23:28} So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the desert.
{Num 23:28} 巴勒就领巴兰到那下望旷野的毗珥山顶上。
{Num 23:29} And Balaam said to Balak, "Build for me here seven altars and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams."
{Num 23:29} 巴兰对巴勒说：“你在这里为我筑七座坛，又在这里为我预备七只公牛，七只公羊。”
{Num 23:30} And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
{Num 23:30} 巴勒就照巴兰的话行，在每座坛上献一只公牛，一只公羊。
{Num 24:1}  When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go, as at other times, to look for omens, but set his face toward the wilderness.
{Num 24:1}  巴兰见耶和华喜欢赐福与以色列，就不像前两次去求法术，却面向旷野。
{Num 24:2}  And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe. And the Spirit of God came upon him,
{Num 24:2}  巴兰举目，看见以色列人照着支派居住。神的灵就临到他身上，
{Num 24:3}  and he took up his discourse and said, "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,
{Num 24:3}  他便题起诗歌说：比珥的儿子巴兰说，眼目闭住（或作：睁开）的人说，
{Num 24:4}  the oracle of him who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down with his eyes uncovered:
{Num 24:4}  得听神的言语，得见全能者的异象，眼目睁开而仆倒的人说：
{Num 24:5}  How lovely are your tents, O Jacob, your encampments, O Israel!
{Num 24:5}  雅各啊，你的帐棚何等华美！以色列啊，你的帐幕何其华丽！
{Num 24:6}  Like palm groves that stretch afar, like gardens beside a river, like aloes that the LORD has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters.
{Num 24:6}  如接连的山谷，如河旁的园子，如耶和华所栽的沉香树，如水边的香柏木。
{Num 24:7}  Water shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters; his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
{Num 24:7}  水要从他的桶里流出；种子要撒在多水之处。他的王必超过亚甲；他的国必要振兴。
{Num 24:8}  God brings him out of Egypt and is for him like the horns of the wild ox; he shall eat up the nations, his adversaries, and shall break their bones in pieces and pierce them through with his arrows.
{Num 24:8}  神领他出埃及；他似乎有野牛之力。他要吞吃敌国，折断他们的骨头，用箭射透他们。
{Num 24:9}  He crouched, he lay down like a lion and like a lioness; who will rouse him up? Blessed are those who bless you, and cursed are those who curse you."
{Num 24:9}  他蹲如公狮，卧如母狮，谁敢惹他？凡给你祝福的，愿他蒙福；凡咒诅你的，愿他受咒诅。
{Num 24:10} And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them these three times.
{Num 24:10} 巴勒向巴兰生气，就拍起手来，对巴兰说：“我召你来为我咒诅仇敌，不料，你这三次竟为他们祝福。
{Num 24:11} Therefore now flee to your own place. I said, 'I will certainly honor you,' but the LORD has held you back from honor."
{Num 24:11} 如今你快回本地去吧！我想使你得大尊荣，耶和华却阻止你不得尊荣。”
{Num 24:12} And Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,
{Num 24:12} 巴兰对巴勒说：“我岂不是对你所差遣到我那里的使者说：
{Num 24:13} 'If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own will. What the LORD speaks, that will I speak'?
{Num 24:13} ‘巴勒就是将他满屋的金银给我，我也不得越过耶和华的命，凭自己的心意行好行歹。耶和华说什么，我就要说什么’？”
{Num 24:14} And now, behold, I am going to my people. Come, I will let you know what this people will do to your people in the latter days."
{Num 24:14} “现在我要回本族去。你来，我告诉你这民日后要怎样待你的民。”
{Num 24:15} And he took up his discourse and said, "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,
{Num 24:15} 他就题起诗歌说：比珥的儿子巴兰说：眼目闭住（或作：睁开）的人说，
{Num 24:16} the oracle of him who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down with his eyes uncovered:
{Num 24:16} 得听神的言语，明白至高者的意旨，看见全能者的异象，眼目睁开而仆倒的人说：
{Num 24:17} I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near: a star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; it shall crush the forehead of Moab and break down all the sons of Sheth.
{Num 24:17} 我看他却不在现时；我望他却不在近日。有星要出于雅各，有杖要兴于以色列，必打破摩押的四角，毁坏扰乱之子。
{Num 24:18} Edom shall be dispossessed; Seir also, his enemies, shall be dispossessed. Israel is doing valiantly.
{Num 24:18} 他必得以东为基业，又得仇敌之地西珥为产业；以色列必行事勇敢。
{Num 24:19} And one from Jacob shall exercise dominion and destroy the survivors of cities!"
{Num 24:19} 有一位出于雅各的，必掌大权；他要除灭城中的余民。
{Num 24:20} Then he looked on Amalek and took up his discourse and said, "Amalek was the first among the nations, but its end is utter destruction."
{Num 24:20} 巴兰观看亚玛力，就题起诗歌说：亚玛力原为诸国之首，但他终必沉沦。
{Num 24:21} And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, "Enduring is your dwelling place, and your nest is set in the rock.
{Num 24:21} 巴兰观看基尼人，就题起诗歌说：你的住处本是坚固；你的窝巢做在岩穴中。
{Num 24:22} Nevertheless, Kain shall be burned when Asshur takes you away captive."
{Num 24:22} 然而基尼必至衰微，直到亚述把你掳去。
{Num 24:23} And he took up his discourse and said, "Alas, who shall live when God does this?
{Num 24:23} 巴兰又题起诗歌说：哀哉！神行这事，谁能得活？
{Num 24:24} But ships shall come from Kittim and shall afflict Asshur and Eber; and he too shall come to utter destruction."
{Num 24:24} 必有人乘船从基提界而来，苦害亚述，苦害希伯；他也必至沉沦。
{Num 24:25} Then Balaam rose and went back to his place. And Balak also went his way.
{Num 24:25} 于是巴兰起来，回他本地去；巴勒也回去了。
{Num 25:1}  While Israel lived in Shittim, the people began to whore with the daughters of Moab.
{Num 25:1}  以色列人住在什亭，百姓与摩押女子行起淫乱。
{Num 25:2}  These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
{Num 25:2}  因为这女子叫百姓来，一同给他们的神献祭，百姓就吃他们的祭物，跪拜他们的神。
{Num 25:3}  So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
{Num 25:3}  以色列人与巴力毗珥连合，耶和华的怒气就向以色列人发作。
{Num 25:4}  And the LORD said to Moses, "Take all the chiefs of the people and hang them in the sun before the LORD, that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel."
{Num 25:4}  耶和华吩咐摩西说：“将百姓中所有的族长在我面前对着日头悬挂，使我向以色列人所发的怒气可以消了。”
{Num 25:5}  And Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Each of you kill those of his men who have yoked themselves to Baal of Peor."
{Num 25:5}  于是摩西吩咐以色列的审判官说：“凡属你们的人，有与巴力毗珥连合的，你们各人要把他们杀了。”
{Num 25:6}  And behold, one of the people of Israel came and brought a Midianite woman to his family, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of the whole congregation of the people of Israel, while they were weeping in the entrance of the tent of meeting.
{Num 25:6}  摩西和以色列全会众正在会幕门前哭泣的时候，谁知，有以色列中的一个人，当他们眼前，带着一个米甸女人到他弟兄那里去。
{Num 25:7}  When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose and left the congregation and took a spear in his hand
{Num 25:7}  祭司亚伦的孙子，以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈看见了，就从会中起来，手里拿着枪，
{Num 25:8}  and went after the man of Israel into the chamber and pierced both of them, the man of Israel and the woman through her belly. Thus the plague on the people of Israel was stopped.
{Num 25:8}  跟随那以色列人进亭子里去，便将以色列人和那女人由腹中刺透。这样，在以色列人中瘟疫就止息了。
{Num 25:9}  Nevertheless, those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
{Num 25:9}  那时遭瘟疫死的，有二万四千人。
{Num 25:10} And the LORD said to Moses,
{Num 25:10} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 25:11} "Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back my wrath from the people of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the people of Israel in my jealousy.
{Num 25:11} “祭司亚伦的孙子，以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈，使我向以色列人所发的怒消了；因他在他们中间，以我的忌邪为心，使我不在忌邪中把他们除灭。
{Num 25:12} Therefore say, 'Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace,
{Num 25:12} 因此，你要说：‘我将我平安的约赐给他。
{Num 25:13} and it shall be to him and to his descendants after him the covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the people of Israel.'"
{Num 25:13} 这约要给他和他的后裔，作为永远当祭司职任的约；因他为神有忌邪的心，为以色列人赎罪。’”
{Num 25:14} The name of the slain man of Israel, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, chief of a father's house belonging to the Simeonites.
{Num 25:14} 那与米甸女人一同被杀的以色列人，名叫心利，是撒路的儿子，是西缅一个宗族的首领。
{Num 25:15} And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was the tribal head of a father's house in Midian.
{Num 25:15} 那被杀的米甸女人，名叫哥斯比，是苏珥的女儿；这苏珥是米甸一个宗族的首领。
{Num 25:16} And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 25:16} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 25:17} "Harass the Midianites and strike them down,
{Num 25:17} “你要扰害米甸人，击杀他们；
{Num 25:18} for they have harassed you with their wiles, with which they beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the chief of Midian, their sister, who was killed on the day of the plague on account of Peor."
{Num 25:18} 因为他们用诡计扰害你们，在毗珥的事上和他们的姊妹、米甸首领的女儿哥斯比的事上，用这诡计诱惑了你们；这哥斯比，当瘟疫流行的日子，因毗珥的事被杀了。”
{Num 26:1}  After the plague, the LORD said to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest,
{Num 26:1}  瘟疫之后，耶和华晓谕摩西和祭司亚伦的儿子以利亚撒说：
{Num 26:2}  "Take a census of all the congregation of the people of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all in Israel who are able to go to war."
{Num 26:2}  “你们要将以色列全会众，按他们的宗族，凡以色列中从二十岁以外、能出去打仗的，计算总数。”
{Num 26:3}  And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
{Num 26:3}  摩西和祭司以利亚撒在摩押平原与耶利哥相对的约但河边向以色列人说：
{Num 26:4}  "Take a census of the people, from twenty years old and upward," as the LORD commanded Moses. The people of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt were:
{Num 26:4}  “将你们中间从二十岁以外的计算总数”；是照耶和华吩咐出埃及地的摩西和以色列人的话。

{Num 26:10} and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, when the fire devoured 250 men, and they became a warning.
{Num 26:10} 地便开口吞了他们，和可拉、可拉的党类一同死亡。那时火烧灭了二百五十个人；他们就作了警戒。

{Num 26:53} “你要按着人名的数目将地分给这些人为业。
{Num 26:54} To a large tribe you shall give a large inheritance, and to a small tribe you shall give a small inheritance; every tribe shall be given its inheritance in proportion to its list.
{Num 26:54} 人多的，你要把产业多分给他们；人少的，你要把产业少分给他们；要照被数的人数，把产业分给各人。
{Num 26:55} But the land shall be divided by lot. According to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.
{Num 26:55} 虽是这样，还要拈阄分地。他们要按着祖宗各支派的名字承受为业。

{Num 27:3}  "Our father died in the wilderness. He was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah, but died for his own sin. And he had no sons.
{Num 27:3}  “我们的父亲死在旷野。他不与可拉同党聚集攻击耶和华，是在自己罪中死的；他也没有儿子。
{Num 27:4}  Why should the name of our father be taken away from his clan because he had no son? Give to us a possession among our father's brothers."
{Num 27:4}  为什么因我们的父亲没有儿子就把他的名从他族中除掉呢？求你们在我们父亲的弟兄中分给我们产业。”
{Num 27:5}  Moses brought their case before the LORD.
{Num 27:5}  于是，摩西将他们的案件呈到耶和华面前。
{Num 27:6}  And the LORD said to Moses,
{Num 27:6}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 27:7}  "The daughters of Zelophehad are right. You shall give them possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers and transfer the inheritance of their father to them.
{Num 27:7}  “西罗非哈的女儿说得有理。你定要在他们父亲的弟兄中，把地分给他们为业；要将他们父亲的产业归给他们。
{Num 27:8}  And you shall speak to the people of Israel, saying, 'If a man dies and has no son, then you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
{Num 27:8}  你也要晓谕以色列人说：‘人若死了没有儿子，就要把他的产业归给他的女儿。
{Num 27:9}  And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
{Num 27:9}  他若没有女儿，就要把他的产业给他的弟兄。
{Num 27:10} And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
{Num 27:10} 他若没有弟兄，就要把他的产业给他父亲的弟兄。
{Num 27:11} And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the nearest kinsman of his clan, and he shall possess it. And it shall be for the people of Israel a statute and rule, as the LORD commanded Moses.'"
{Num 27:11} 他父亲若没有弟兄，就要把他的产业给他族中最近的亲属，他便要得为业。’这要作以色列人的律例典章，是照耶和华吩咐摩西的。”
{Num 27:12} The LORD said to Moses, "Go up into this mountain of Abarim and see the land that I have given to the people of Israel.
{Num 27:12} 耶和华对摩西说：“你上这亚巴琳山，观看我所赐给以色列人的地。
{Num 27:13} When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was,
{Num 27:13} 看了以后，你也必归到你列祖（原文作本民）那里，像你哥哥亚伦一样。
{Num 27:14} because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin when the congregation quarreled, failing to uphold me as holy at the waters before their eyes." (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
{Num 27:14} 因为你们在寻的旷野，当会众争闹的时候，违背了我的命，没有在涌水之地、会众眼前尊我为圣。”（这水就是寻的旷野加低斯米利巴水。）
{Num 27:15} Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,
{Num 27:15} 摩西对耶和华说：
{Num 27:16} "Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation
{Num 27:16} “愿耶和华万人之灵的神，立一个人治理会众，
{Num 27:17} who shall go out before them and come in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of the LORD may not be as sheep that have no shepherd."
{Num 27:17} 可以在他们面前出入，也可以引导他们，免得耶和华的会众如同没有牧人的羊群一般。”
{Num 27:18} So the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him.
{Num 27:18} 耶和华对摩西说：“嫩的儿子约书亚是心中有圣灵的；你将他领来，按手在他头上，
{Num 27:19} Make him stand before Eleazar the priest and all the congregation, and you shall commission him in their sight.
{Num 27:19} 使他站在祭司以利亚撒和全会众面前，嘱咐他，
{Num 27:20} You shall invest him with some of your authority, that all the congregation of the people of Israel may obey.
{Num 27:20} 又将你的尊荣给他几分，使以色列全会众都听从他。
{Num 27:21} And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the LORD. At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the people of Israel with him, the whole congregation."
{Num 27:21} 他要站在祭司以利亚撒面前；以利亚撒要凭乌陵的判断，在耶和华面前为他求问。他和以色列全会众都要遵以利亚撒的命出入。”
{Num 27:22} And Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and made him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation,
{Num 27:22} 于是摩西照耶和华所吩咐的将约书亚领来，使他站在祭司以利亚撒和全会众面前，
{Num 27:23} and he laid his hands on him and commissioned him as the LORD directed through Moses.
{Num 27:23} 按手在他头上，嘱咐他，是照耶和华藉摩西所说的话。
{Num 28:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 28:1}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 28:2}  "Command the people of Israel and say to them, 'My offering, my food for my food offerings, my pleasing aroma, you shall be careful to offer to me at its appointed time.'
{Num 28:2}  “你要吩咐以色列人说：‘献给我的供物，就是献给我作馨香火祭的食物，你们要按日期献给我’；
{Num 28:3}  And you shall say to them, This is the food offering that you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs a year old without blemish, day by day, as a regular offering.
{Num 28:3}  又要对他们说：你们要献给耶和华的火祭，就是没有残疾、一岁的公羊羔，每日两只，作为常献的燔祭。

{Num 28:6}  这是西乃山所命定为常献的燔祭，是献给耶和华为馨香的火祭。

{Num 29:40} So Moses told the people of Israel everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
{Num 29:40} 于是，摩西照耶和华所吩咐他的一切话告诉以色列人。
{Num 30:1}  Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the people of Israel, saying, "This is what the LORD has commanded.
{Num 30:1}  摩西晓谕以色列各支派的首领说：“耶和华所吩咐的乃是这样：
{Num 30:2}  If a man vows a vow to the LORD, or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
{Num 30:2}  人若向耶和华许愿或起誓，要约束自己，就不可食言，必要按口中所出的一切话行。
{Num 30:3}  "If a woman vows a vow to the LORD and binds herself by a pledge, while within her father's house in her youth,
{Num 30:3}  女子年幼、还在父家的时候，若向耶和华许愿，要约束自己，
{Num 30:4}  and her father hears of her vow and of her pledge by which she has bound herself and says nothing to her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge by which she has bound herself shall stand.
{Num 30:4}  他父亲也听见他所许的愿并约束自己的话，却向他默默不言，他所许的愿并约束自己的话就都要为定。
{Num 30:5}  But if her father opposes her on the day that he hears of it, no vow of hers, no pledge by which she has bound herself shall stand. And the LORD will forgive her, because her father opposed her.
{Num 30:5}  但他父亲听见的日子若不应承他所许的愿和约束自己的话，就都不得为定；耶和华也必赦免他，因为他父亲不应承。
{Num 30:6}  "If she marries a husband, while under her vows or any thoughtless utterance of her lips by which she has bound herself,
{Num 30:6}  他若出了嫁，有愿在身，或是口中出了约束自己的冒失话，
{Num 30:7}  and her husband hears of it and says nothing to her on the day that he hears, then her vows shall stand, and her pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand.
{Num 30:7}  他丈夫听见的日子，却向他默默不言，他所许的愿并约束自己的话就都要为定。
{Num 30:8}  But if, on the day that her husband comes to hear of it, he opposes her, then he makes void her vow that was on her, and the thoughtless utterance of her lips by which she bound herself. And the LORD will forgive her.
{Num 30:8}  但他丈夫听见的日子，若不应承，就算废了他所许的愿和他出口约束自己的冒失话；耶和华也必赦免他。
{Num 30:9}  (But any vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, anything by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her.)
{Num 30:9}  寡妇或是被休的妇人所许的愿，就是他约束自己的话，都要为定。
{Num 30:10} And if she vowed in her husband's house or bound herself by a pledge with an oath,
{Num 30:10} 他若在丈夫家里许了愿或起了誓，约束自己，
{Num 30:11} and her husband heard of it and said nothing to her and did not oppose her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge by which she bound herself shall stand.
{Num 30:11} 丈夫听见，却向他默默不言，也没有不应承，他所许的愿并约束自己的话就都要为定。
{Num 30:12} But if her husband makes them null and void on the day that he hears them, then whatever proceeds out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning her pledge of herself shall not stand. Her husband has made them void, and the LORD will forgive her.
{Num 30:12} 丈夫听见的日子，若把这两样全废了，妇人口中所许的愿或是约束自己的话就都不得为定，因他丈夫已经把这两样废了；耶和华也必赦免他。
{Num 30:13} Any vow and any binding oath to afflict herself, her husband may establish, or her husband may make void.
{Num 30:13} 凡他所许的愿和刻苦约束自己所起的誓，他丈夫可以坚定，也可以废去。
{Num 30:14} But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows or all her pledges that are upon her. He has established them, because he said nothing to her on the day that he heard of them.
{Num 30:14} 倘若他丈夫天天向他默默不言，就算是坚定他所许的愿和约束自己的话；因丈夫听见的日子向他默默不言，就使这两样坚定。
{Num 30:15} But if he makes them null and void after he has heard of them, then he shall bear her iniquity."
{Num 30:15} 但他丈夫听见以后，若使这两样全废了，就要担当妇人的罪孽。”
{Num 30:16} These are the statutes that the LORD commanded Moses about a man and his wife and about a father and his daughter while she is in her youth within her father's house.
{Num 30:16} 这是丈夫待妻子，父亲待女儿，女儿年幼、还在父家，耶和华所吩咐摩西的律例。
{Num 31:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 31:1}  耶和华吩咐摩西说：
{Num 31:2}  "Avenge the people of Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people."
{Num 31:2}  “你要在米甸人身上报以色列人的仇，后来要归到你列祖（原文作本民）那里。”
{Num 31:3}  So Moses spoke to the people, saying, "Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD's vengeance on Midian.
{Num 31:3}  摩西吩咐百姓说：“要从你们中间叫人带兵器出去攻击米甸，好在米甸人身上为耶和华报仇。
{Num 31:4}  You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war."
{Num 31:4}  从以色列众支派中，每支派要打发一千人去打仗。”
{Num 31:5}  So there were provided, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
{Num 31:5}  于是从以色列千万人中，每支派交出一千人，共一万二千人，带着兵器预备打仗。
{Num 31:6}  And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand from each tribe, together with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
{Num 31:6}  摩西就打发每支派的一千人去打仗，并打发祭司以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈同去；非尼哈手里拿着圣所的器皿和吹大声的号筒。
{Num 31:7}  They warred against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and killed every male.
{Num 31:7}  他们就照耶和华所吩咐摩西的，与米甸人打仗，杀了所有的男丁。
{Num 31:8}  They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. And they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.
{Num 31:8}  在所杀的人中，杀了米甸的五王，就是以未、利金、苏珥、户珥、利巴，又用刀杀了比珥的儿子巴兰。
{Num 31:9}  And the people of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and they took as plunder all their cattle, their flocks, and all their goods.
{Num 31:9}  以色列人掳了米甸人的妇女孩子，并将他们的牲畜、羊群，和所有的财物都夺了来，当作掳物，
{Num 31:10} All their cities in the places where they lived, and all their encampments, they burned with fire,
{Num 31:10} 又用火焚烧他们所住的城邑和所有的营寨，
{Num 31:11} and took all the spoil and all the plunder, both of man and of beast.
{Num 31:11} 把一切所夺的、所掳的，连人带牲畜都带了去，
{Num 31:12} Then they brought the captives and the plunder and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the people of Israel, at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
{Num 31:12} 将所掳的人，所夺的牲畜、财物，都带到摩押平原，在约但河边与耶利哥相对的营盘，交给摩西和祭司以利亚撒，并以色列的会众。
{Num 31:13} Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.
{Num 31:13} 摩西和祭司以利亚撒，并会众一切的首领，都出到营外迎接他们。
{Num 31:14} And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had come from service in the war.
{Num 31:14} 摩西向打仗回来的军长，就是千夫长、百夫长，发怒，
{Num 31:15} Moses said to them, "Have you let all the women live?
{Num 31:15} 对他们说：“你们要存留这一切妇女的活命吗？
{Num 31:16} Behold, these, on Balaam's advice, caused the people of Israel to act treacherously against the LORD in the incident of Peor, and so the plague came among the congregation of the LORD.
{Num 31:16} 这些妇女因巴兰的计谋，叫以色列人在毗珥的事上得罪耶和华，以致耶和华的会众遭遇瘟疫。
{Num 31:17} Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.
{Num 31:17} 所以，你们要把一切的男孩和所有已嫁的女子都杀了。
{Num 31:18} But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.
{Num 31:18} 但女孩子中，凡没有出嫁的，你们都可以存留他的活命。
{Num 31:19} Encamp outside the camp seven days. Whoever of you has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day.
{Num 31:19} 你们要在营外驻扎七日；凡杀了人的，和一切摸了被杀的，并你们所掳来的人口，第三日，第七日，都要洁净自己，
{Num 31:20} You shall purify every garment, every article of skin, all work of goats' hair, and every article of wood."
{Num 31:20} 也要因一切的衣服、皮物、山羊毛织的物，和各样的木器，洁净自己。”
{Num 31:21} Then Eleazar the priest said to the men in the army who had gone to battle: "This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded Moses:
{Num 31:21} 祭司以利亚撒对打仗回来的兵丁说：“耶和华所吩咐摩西律法中的条例乃是这样：
{Num 31:22} only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
{Num 31:22} 金、银、铜、铁、锡、铅，
{Num 31:23} everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless, it shall also be purified with the water for impurity. And whatever cannot stand the fire, you shall pass through the water.
{Num 31:23} 凡能见火的，你们要叫他经火就为洁净，然而还要用除污秽的水洁净他；凡不能见火的，你们要叫他过水。
{Num 31:24} You must wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean. And afterward you may come into the camp."
{Num 31:24} 第七日，你们要洗衣服，就为洁净，然后可以进营。”
{Num 31:25} The LORD said to Moses,
{Num 31:25} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 31:26} "Take the count of the plunder that was taken, both of man and of beast, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers' houses of the congregation,
{Num 31:26} “你和祭司以利亚撒，并会众的各族长，要计算所掳来的人口和牲畜的总数。
{Num 31:27} and divide the plunder into two parts between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
{Num 31:27} 把所掳来的分作两半：一半归与出去打仗的精兵，一半归与全会众。
{Num 31:28} And levy for the LORD a tribute from the men of war who went out to battle, one out of five hundred, of the people and of the oxen and of the donkeys and of the flocks.
{Num 31:28} 又要从出去打仗所得的人口、牛、驴、羊群中，每五百取一，作为贡物奉给耶和华。
{Num 31:29} Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to the LORD.
{Num 31:29} 从他们一半之中，要取出来交给祭司以利亚撒，作为耶和华的举祭。
{Num 31:30} And from the people of Israel's half you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the people, of the oxen, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the cattle, and give them to the Levites who keep guard over the tabernacle of the LORD."
{Num 31:30} 从以色列人的一半之中，就是从人口、牛、驴、羊群、各样牲畜中，每五十取一，交给看守耶和华帐幕的利未人。”
{Num 31:31} And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Num 31:31} 于是摩西和祭司以利亚撒照耶和华所吩咐摩西的行了。
{Num 31:32} Now the plunder remaining of the spoil that the army took was 675,000 sheep,
{Num 31:32} 除了兵丁所夺的财物以外，所掳来的：羊六十七万五千只；
{Num 31:33} 72,000 cattle,
{Num 31:33} 牛七万二千只；
{Num 31:34} 61,000 donkeys,
{Num 31:34} 驴六万一千匹；
{Num 31:35} and 32,000 persons in all, women who had not known man by lying with him.
{Num 31:35} 女人共三万二千口，都是没有出嫁的。
{Num 31:36} And the half, the portion of those who had gone out in the army, numbered 337,500 sheep,
{Num 31:36} 出去打仗之人的分，就是他们所得的那一半，共计羊三十三万七千五百只，
{Num 31:37} and the LORD's tribute of sheep was 675.
{Num 31:37} 从其中归耶和华为贡物的，有六百七十五只；
{Num 31:38} The cattle were 36,000, of which the LORD's tribute was 72.
{Num 31:38} 牛三万六千只，从其中归耶和华为贡物的，有七十二只；
{Num 31:39} The donkeys were 30,500, of which the LORD's tribute was 61.
{Num 31:39} 驴三万零五百匹，从其中归耶和华为贡物的，有六十一匹；
{Num 31:40} The persons were 16,000, of which the LORD's tribute was 32 persons.
{Num 31:40} 人一万六千口，从其中归耶和华的，有三十二口。
{Num 31:41} And Moses gave the tribute, which was the contribution for the LORD, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Num 31:41} 摩西把贡物，就是归与耶和华的举祭，交给祭司以利亚撒，是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的。
{Num 31:42} From the people of Israel's half, which Moses separated from that of the men who had served in the army--
{Num 31:42} 以色列人所得的那一半，就是摩西从打仗的人取来分给他们的。
{Num 31:43} now the congregation's half was 337,500 sheep,
{Num 31:43} （会众的那一半有：羊三十三万七千五百只；
{Num 31:44} 36,000 cattle,
{Num 31:44} 牛三万六千只；
{Num 31:45} and 30,500 donkeys,
{Num 31:45} 驴三万零五百匹；
{Num 31:46} and 16,000 persons--
{Num 31:46} 人一万六千口。）
{Num 31:47} from the people of Israel's half Moses took one of every 50, both of persons and of beasts, and gave them to the Levites who kept guard over the tabernacle of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Num 31:47} 无论是人口是牲畜，摩西每五十取一，交给看守耶和华帐幕的利未人，是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的。
{Num 31:48} Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, came near to Moses
{Num 31:48} 带领千军的各军长，就是千夫长、百夫长，都近前来见摩西，
{Num 31:49} and said to Moses, "Your servants have counted the men of war who are under our command, and there is not a man missing from us.
{Num 31:49} 对他说：“仆人权下的兵已经计算总数，并不短少一人。
{Num 31:50} And we have brought the LORD's offering, what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and beads, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."
{Num 31:50} 如今我们将各人所得的金器，就是脚链子、镯子、打印的戒指、耳环、手钏，都送来为耶和华的供物，好在耶和华面前为我们的生命赎罪。”
{Num 31:51} And Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them the gold, all crafted articles.
{Num 31:51} 摩西和祭司以利亚撒就收了他们的金子，都是打成的器皿。
{Num 31:52} And all the gold of the contribution that they presented to the LORD, from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, was 16,750 shekels.
{Num 31:52} 千夫长、百夫长所献给耶和华为举祭的金子共有一万六千七百五十舍客勒。
{Num 31:53} (The men in the army had each taken plunder for himself.)
{Num 31:53} 各兵丁都为自己夺了财物。
{Num 31:54} And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, as a memorial for the people of Israel before the LORD.
{Num 31:54} 摩西和祭司以利亚撒收了千夫长、百夫长的金子，就带进会幕，在耶和华面前作为以色列人的纪念。
{Num 32:1}  Now the people of Reuben and the people of Gad had a very great number of livestock. And they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place was a place for livestock.
{Num 32:1}  流便子孙和迦得子孙的牲畜极其众多；他们看见雅谢地和基列地是可牧放牲畜之地，
{Num 32:2}  So the people of Gad and the people of Reuben came and said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the chiefs of the congregation,
{Num 32:2}  就来见摩西和祭司以利亚撒，并会众的首领，说：
{Num 32:3}  "Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,
{Num 32:3}  “亚大录、底本、雅谢、宁拉、希实本、以利亚利、示班、尼波、比稳，
{Num 32:4}  the land that the LORD struck down before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock."
{Num 32:4}  就是耶和华在以色列会众前面所攻取之地，是可牧放牲畜之地，你仆人也有牲畜”；
{Num 32:5}  And they said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Do not take us across the Jordan."
{Num 32:5}  又说：“我们若在你眼前蒙恩，求你把这地给我们为业，不要领我们过约但河。”
{Num 32:6}  But Moses said to the people of Gad and to the people of Reuben, "Shall your brothers go to the war while you sit here?
{Num 32:6}  摩西对迦得子孙和流便子孙说：“难道你们的弟兄去打仗，你们竟坐在这里吗？
{Num 32:7}  Why will you discourage the heart of the people of Israel from going over into the land that the LORD has given them?
{Num 32:7}  你们为何使以色列人灰心丧胆、不过去进入耶和华所赐给他们的那地呢？
{Num 32:8}  Your fathers did this, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
{Num 32:8}  我先前从加低斯巴尼亚打发你们先祖去窥探那地，他们也是这样行。
{Num 32:9}  For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the people of Israel from going into the land that the LORD had given them.
{Num 32:9}  他们上以实各谷，去窥探那地回来的时候，使以色列人灰心丧胆，不进入耶和华所赐给他们的地。
{Num 32:10} And the LORD's anger was kindled on that day, and he swore, saying,
{Num 32:10} 当日，耶和华的怒气发作，就起誓说：
{Num 32:11} 'Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not wholly followed me,
{Num 32:11} ‘凡从埃及上来、二十岁以外的人断不得看见我对亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓应许之地，因为他们没有专心跟从我。
{Num 32:12} none except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have wholly followed the LORD.'
{Num 32:12} 惟有基尼洗族耶孚尼的儿子迦勒和嫩的儿子约书亚可以看见，因为他们专心跟从我。’
{Num 32:13} And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was gone.
{Num 32:13} 耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作，使他们在旷野飘流四十年，等到在耶和华眼前行恶的那一代人都消灭了。
{Num 32:14} And behold, you have risen in your fathers' place, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more the fierce anger of the LORD against Israel!
{Num 32:14} 谁知，你们起来接续先祖，增添罪人的数目，使耶和华向以色列大发烈怒。
{Num 32:15} For if you turn away from following him, he will again abandon them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all this people."
{Num 32:15} 你们若退后不跟从他，他还要把以色列人撇在旷野，便是你们使这众民灭亡。”
{Num 32:16} Then they came near to him and said, "We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones,
{Num 32:16} 两支派的人挨近摩西，说：“我们要在这里为牲畜垒圈，为妇人孩子造城。
{Num 32:17} but we will take up arms, ready to go before the people of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
{Num 32:17} 我们自己要带兵器行在以色列人的前头，好把他们领到他们的地方；但我们的妇人孩子，因这地居民的缘故，要住在坚固的城内。
{Num 32:18} We will not return to our homes until each of the people of Israel has gained his inheritance.
{Num 32:18} 我们不回家，直等到以色列人各承受自己的产业。
{Num 32:19} For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan to the east."
{Num 32:19} 我们不和他们在约但河那边一带之地同受产业，因为我们的产业是坐落在约但河东边这里。”
{Num 32:20} So Moses said to them, "If you will do this, if you will take up arms to go before the LORD for the war,
{Num 32:20} 摩西对他们说：“你们若这样行，在耶和华面前带着兵器出去打仗，
{Num 32:21} and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before the LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him
{Num 32:21} 所有带兵器的人都要在耶和华面前过约但河，等他赶出他的仇敌，
{Num 32:22} and the land is subdued before the LORD; then after that you shall return and be free of obligation to the LORD and to Israel, and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
{Num 32:22} 那地被耶和华制伏了，然后你们可以回来，向耶和华和以色列才为无罪，这地也必在耶和华面前归你们为业。
{Num 32:23} But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD, and be sure your sin will find you out.
{Num 32:23} 倘若你们不这样行，就得罪耶和华，要知道你们的罪必追上你们。
{Num 32:24} Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what you have promised."
{Num 32:24} 如今你们口中所出的，只管去行，为你们的妇人孩子造城，为你们的羊群垒圈。”
{Num 32:25} And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben said to Moses, "Your servants will do as my lord commands.
{Num 32:25} 迦得子孙和流便子孙对摩西说：“仆人要照我主所吩咐的去行。
{Num 32:26} Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead,
{Num 32:26} 我们的妻子、孩子、羊群，和所有的牲畜都要留在基列的各城。
{Num 32:27} but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord orders."
{Num 32:27} 但你的仆人，凡带兵器的，都要照我主所说的话，在耶和华面前过去打仗。”
{Num 32:28} So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel.
{Num 32:28} 于是，摩西为他们嘱咐祭司以利亚撒和嫩的儿子约书亚，并以色列众支派的族长，
{Num 32:29} And Moses said to them, "If the people of Gad and the people of Reuben, every man who is armed to battle before the LORD, will pass with you over the Jordan and the land shall be subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.
{Num 32:29} 说：“迦得子孙和流便子孙，凡带兵器在耶和华面前去打仗的，若与你们一同过约但河，那地被你们制伏了，你们就要把基列地给他们为业。
{Num 32:30} However, if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."
{Num 32:30} 倘若他们不带兵器和你们一同过去，就要在迦南地你们中间得产业。”
{Num 32:31} And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben answered, "What the LORD has said to your servants, we will do.
{Num 32:31} 迦得子孙和流便子孙回答说：“耶和华怎样吩咐仆人，仆人就怎样行。
{Num 32:32} We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan."
{Num 32:32} 我们要带兵器，在耶和华面前过去，进入迦南地，只是约但河这边、我们所得为业之地仍归我们。”
{Num 32:33} And Moses gave to them, to the people of Gad and to the people of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land and its cities with their territories, the cities of the land throughout the country.
{Num 32:33} 摩西将亚摩利王西宏的国和巴珊王噩的国，连那地和周围的城邑，都给了迦得子孙和流便子孙，并约瑟的儿子玛拿西半个支派。
{Num 32:34} And the people of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
{Num 32:34} 迦得子孙建造底本、亚他录、亚罗珥、
{Num 32:35} Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
{Num 32:35} 亚他录朔反、雅谢、约比哈、
{Num 32:36} Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran, fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
{Num 32:36} 伯宁拉、伯哈兰，都是坚固城。他们又垒羊圈。
{Num 32:37} And the people of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
{Num 32:37} 流便子孙建造希实本、以利亚利、基列亭、
{Num 32:38} Nebo, and Baal-meon (their names were changed), and Sibmah. And they gave other names to the cities that they built.
{Num 32:38} 尼波、巴力免、西比玛（尼波、巴力免，名字是改了的），又给他们所建造的城另起别名。
{Num 32:39} And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
{Num 32:39} 玛拿西的儿子玛吉，他的子孙往基列去，占了那地，赶出那里的亚摩利人。
{Num 32:40} And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he settled in it.
{Num 32:40} 摩西将基列赐给玛拿西的儿子玛吉，他子孙就住在那里。
{Num 32:41} And Jair the son of Manasseh went and captured their villages, and called them Havvoth-jair.
{Num 32:41} 玛拿西的子孙睚珥去占了基列的村庄，就称这些村庄为哈倭特睚珥。
{Num 32:42} And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
{Num 32:42} 挪巴去占了基纳和基纳的乡村，就按自己的名称基纳为挪巴。
{Num 33:1}  These are the stages of the people of Israel, when they went out of the land of Egypt by their companies under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
{Num 33:1}  以色列人按着军队，在摩西、亚伦的手下出埃及地所行的路程（或作：站口；下同）记在下面。
{Num 33:2}  Moses wrote down their starting places, stage by stage, by command of the LORD, and these are their stages according to their starting places.
{Num 33:2}  摩西遵着耶和华的吩咐记载他们所行的路程，其路程乃是这样：
{Num 33:3}  They set out from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month. On the day after the Passover, the people of Israel went out triumphantly in the sight of all the Egyptians,
{Num 33:3}  正月十五日，就是逾越节的次日，以色列人从兰塞起行，在一切埃及人眼前昂然无惧地出去。
{Num 33:4}  while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them. On their gods also the LORD executed judgments.
{Num 33:4}  那时，埃及人正葬埋他们的长子，就是耶和华在他们中间所击杀的；耶和华也败坏他们的神。
{Num 33:5}  So the people of Israel set out from Rameses and camped at Succoth.

{Num 33:51} "Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
{Num 33:51} “你吩咐以色列人说：你们过约但河进迦南地的时候，
{Num 33:52} then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their figured stones and destroy all their metal images and demolish all their high places.
{Num 33:52} 就要从你们面前赶出那里所有的居民，毁灭他们一切錾成的石像和他们一切铸成的偶像，又拆毁他们一切的邱坛。
{Num 33:53} And you shall take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given the land to you to possess it.
{Num 33:53} 你们要夺那地，住在其中，因我把那地赐给你们为业。
{Num 33:54} You shall inherit the land by lot according to your clans. To a large tribe you shall give a large inheritance, and to a small tribe you shall give a small inheritance. Wherever the lot falls for anyone, that shall be his. According to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.
{Num 33:54} 你们要按家室拈阄，承受那地；人多的，要把产业多分给他们；人少的，要把产业少分给他们。拈出何地给何人，就要归何人。你们要按宗族的支派承受。
{Num 33:55} But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those of them whom you let remain shall be as barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they shall trouble you in the land where you dwell.
{Num 33:55} 倘若你们不赶出那地的居民，所容留的居民就必作你们眼中的刺，肋下的荆棘，也必在你们所住的地上扰害你们。
{Num 33:56} And I will do to you as I thought to do to them."
{Num 33:56} 而且我素常有意怎样待他们，也必照样待你们。”
{Num 34:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 34:1}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 34:2}  "Command the people of Israel, and say to them, When you enter the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, the land of Canaan as defined by its borders),
{Num 34:2}  “你吩咐以色列人说：你们到了迦南地，就是归你们为业的迦南四境之地，
{Num 34:3}  your south side shall be from the wilderness of Zin alongside Edom, and your southern border shall run from the end of the Salt Sea on the east.
{Num 34:3}  南角要从寻的旷野，贴着以东的边界；南界要从盐海东头起，
{Num 34:4}  And your border shall turn south of the ascent of Akrabbim, and cross to Zin, and its limit shall be south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon.
{Num 34:4}  绕到亚克拉滨坡的南边，接连到寻，直通到加低斯巴尼亚的南边，又通到哈萨亚达，接连到押们，
{Num 34:5}  And the border shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt, and its limit shall be at the sea.
{Num 34:5}  从押们转到埃及小河，直通到海为止。
{Num 34:6}  "For the western border, you shall have the Great Sea and its coast. This shall be your western border.
{Num 34:6}  “西边要以大海为界；这就是你们的西界。
{Num 34:7}  "This shall be your northern border: from the Great Sea you shall draw a line to Mount Hor.
{Num 34:7}  “北界要从大海起，划到何珥山，
{Num 34:8}  From Mount Hor you shall draw a line to Lebo-hamath, and the limit of the border shall be at Zedad.
{Num 34:8}  从何珥山划到哈马口，通到西达达，
{Num 34:9}  Then the border shall extend to Ziphron, and its limit shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your northern border.
{Num 34:9}  又通到西斐仑，直到哈萨以难。这要作你们的北界。
{Num 34:10} "You shall draw a line for your eastern border from Hazar-enan to Shepham.
{Num 34:10} “你们要从哈萨以难划到示番为东界。
{Num 34:11} And the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain. And the border shall go down and reach to the shoulder of the Sea of Chinnereth on the east.
{Num 34:11} 这界要从示番下到亚延东边的利比拉，又要达到基尼烈湖的东边。
{Num 34:12} And the border shall go down to the Jordan, and its limit shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land as defined by its borders all around."
{Num 34:12} 这界要下到约但河，通到盐海为止。这四围的边界以内，要作你们的地。”
{Num 34:13} Moses commanded the people of Israel, saying, "This is the land that you shall inherit by lot, which the LORD has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half-tribe.
{Num 34:13} 摩西吩咐以色列人说：“这地就是耶和华吩咐拈阄给九个半支派承受为业的；
{Num 34:14} For the tribe of the people of Reuben by fathers' houses and the tribe of the people of Gad by their fathers' houses have received their inheritance, and also the half-tribe of Manasseh.
{Num 34:14} 因为流便支派和迦得支派按着宗族受了产业，玛拿西半个支派也受了产业。
{Num 34:15} The two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, toward the sunrise."
{Num 34:15} 这两个半支派已经在耶利哥对面、约但河东、向日出之地受了产业。”
{Num 34:16} The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 34:16} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 34:17} "These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.
{Num 34:17} “要给你们分地为业之人的名字是祭司以利亚撒和嫩的儿子约书亚。
{Num 34:18} You shall take one chief from every tribe to divide the land for inheritance.
{Num 34:18} 又要从每支派中选一个首领帮助他们。
{Num 34:19} These are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
{Num 34:19} 这些人的名字：犹大支派有耶孚尼的儿子迦勒。
{Num 34:20} Of the tribe of the people of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.

{Num 34:29} These are the men whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance for the people of Israel in the land of Canaan."
{Num 34:29} 这些人就是耶和华所吩咐、在迦南地把产业分给以色列人的。
{Num 35:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
{Num 35:1}  耶和华在摩押平原约但河边、耶利哥对面晓谕摩西说：
{Num 35:2}  "Command the people of Israel to give to the Levites some of the inheritance of their possession as cities for them to dwell in. And you shall give to the Levites pasturelands around the cities.
{Num 35:2}  “你吩咐以色列人，要从所得为业的地中把些城给利未人居住，也要把这城四围的郊野给利未人。
{Num 35:3}  The cities shall be theirs to dwell in, and their pasturelands shall be for their cattle and for their livestock and for all their beasts.
{Num 35:3}  这城邑要归他们居住，城邑的郊野可以牧养他们的牛羊和各样的牲畜，又可以安置他们的财物。
{Num 35:4}  The pasturelands of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around.
{Num 35:4}  你们给利未人的郊野，要从城根起，四围往外量一千肘。
{Num 35:5}  And you shall measure, outside the city, on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the middle. This shall belong to them as pastureland for their cities.
{Num 35:5}  另外东量二千肘，南量二千肘，西量二千肘，北量二千肘，为边界，城在当中；这要归他们作城邑的郊野。
{Num 35:6}  "The cities that you give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge, where you shall permit the manslayer to flee, and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities.
{Num 35:6}  你们给利未人的城邑，其中当有六座逃城，使误杀人的可以逃到那里。此外还要给他们四十二座城。
{Num 35:7}  All the cities that you give to the Levites shall be forty-eight, with their pasturelands.
{Num 35:7}  你们要给利未人的城，共有四十八座，连城带郊野都要给他们。
{Num 35:8}  And as for the cities that you shall give from the possession of the people of Israel, from the larger tribes you shall take many, and from the smaller tribes you shall take few; each, in proportion to the inheritance that it inherits, shall give of its cities to the Levites."
{Num 35:8}  以色列人所得的地业从中要把些城邑给利未人；人多的就多给，人少的就少给；各支派要按所承受为业之地把城邑给利未人。”
{Num 35:9}  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Num 35:9}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Num 35:10} "Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
{Num 35:10} “你吩咐以色列人说：你们过约但河，进了迦南地，
{Num 35:11} then you shall select cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person without intent may flee there.
{Num 35:11} 就要分出几座城，为你们作逃城，使误杀人的可以逃到那里。
{Num 35:12} The cities shall be for you a refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment.
{Num 35:12} 这些城可以作逃避报仇人的城，使误杀人的不至于死，等他站在会众面前听审判。
{Num 35:13} And the cities that you give shall be your six cities of refuge.
{Num 35:13} 你们所分出来的城，要作六座逃城。
{Num 35:14} You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities in the land of Canaan, to be cities of refuge.
{Num 35:14} 在约但河东要分出三座城，在迦南地也要分出三座城，都作逃城。
{Num 35:15} These six cities shall be for refuge for the people of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, that anyone who kills any person without intent may flee there.
{Num 35:15} 这六座城要给以色列人和他们中间的外人，并寄居的，作为逃城，使误杀人的都可以逃到那里。
{Num 35:16} "But if he struck him down with an iron object, so that he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall be put to death.
{Num 35:16} “倘若人用铁器打人，以致打死，他就是故杀人的；故杀人的必被治死。
{Num 35:17} And if he struck him down with a stone tool that could cause death, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall be put to death.
{Num 35:17} 若用可以打死人的石头打死了人，他就是故杀人的；故杀人的必被治死。
{Num 35:18} Or if he struck him down with a wooden tool that could cause death, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall be put to death.
{Num 35:18} 若用可以打死人的木器打死了人，他就是故杀人的；故杀人的必被治死。
{Num 35:19} The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death.
{Num 35:19} 报血仇的必亲自杀那故杀人的，一遇见就杀他。
{Num 35:20} And if he pushed him out of hatred or hurled something at him, lying in wait, so that he died,
{Num 35:20} 人若因怨恨把人推倒，或是埋伏往人身上扔物，以致于死，
{Num 35:21} or in enmity struck him down with his hand, so that he died, then he who struck the blow shall be put to death. He is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.
{Num 35:21} 或是因仇恨用手打人，以致于死，那打人的必被治死。他是故杀人的；报血仇的一遇见就杀他。
{Num 35:22} "But if he pushed him suddenly without enmity, or hurled anything on him without lying in wait
{Num 35:22} “倘若人没有仇恨，忽然将人推倒，或是没有埋伏把物扔在人身上，
{Num 35:23} or used a stone that could cause death, and without seeing him dropped it on him, so that he died, though he was not his enemy and did not seek his harm,
{Num 35:23} 或是没有看见的时候用可以打死人的石头扔在人身上，以致于死，本来与他无仇，也无意害他。
{Num 35:24} then the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood, in accordance with these rules.
{Num 35:24} 会众就要照典章，在打死人的和报血仇的中间审判。
{Num 35:25} And the congregation shall rescue the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he had fled, and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.
{Num 35:25} 会众要救这误杀人的脱离报血仇人的手，也要使他归入逃城。他要住在其中，直等到受圣膏的大祭司死了。
{Num 35:26} But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the boundaries of his city of refuge to which he fled,
{Num 35:26} 但误杀人的，无论什么时候，若出了逃城的境外，
{Num 35:27} and the avenger of blood finds him outside the boundaries of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of blood.
{Num 35:27} 报血仇的在逃城境外遇见他，将他杀了，报血仇的就没有流血之罪。
{Num 35:28} For he must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest, but after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession.
{Num 35:28} 因为误杀人的该住在逃城里，等到大祭司死了。大祭司死了以后，误杀人的才可以回到他所得为业之地。
{Num 35:29} And these things shall be for a statute and rule for you throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.
{Num 35:29} 这在你们一切的住处，要作你们世世代代的律例典章。
{Num 35:30} "If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death on the evidence of witnesses. But no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness.
{Num 35:30} “无论谁故杀人，要凭几个见证人的口把那故杀人的杀了，只是不可凭一个见证的口叫人死。
{Num 35:31} Moreover, you shall accept no ransom for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death, but he shall be put to death.
{Num 35:31} 故杀人、犯死罪的，你们不可收赎价代替他的命；他必被治死。
{Num 35:32} And you shall accept no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to dwell in the land before the death of the high priest.
{Num 35:32} 那逃到逃城的人，你们不可为他收赎价，使他在大祭司未死以先再来住在本地。
{Num 35:33} You shall not pollute the land in which you live, for blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it.
{Num 35:33} 这样，你们就不污秽所住之地，因为血是污秽地的；若有在地上流人血的，非流那杀人者的血，那地就不得洁净（原文作赎）。
{Num 35:34} You shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell, for I the LORD dwell in the midst of the people of Israel."
{Num 35:34} 你们不可玷污所住之地，就是我住在其中之地，因为我耶和华住在以色列人中间。”
{Num 36:1}  The heads of the fathers' houses of the clan of the people of Gilead the son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the clans of the people of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the chiefs, the heads of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel.
{Num 36:1}  约瑟的后裔，玛拿西的孙子，玛吉的儿子基列，他子孙中的诸族长来到摩西和作首领的以色列人族长面前，
{Num 36:2}  They said, "The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the people of Israel, and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
{Num 36:2}  说：“耶和华曾吩咐我主拈阄分地给以色列人为业，我主也受了耶和华的吩咐将我们兄弟西罗非哈的产业分给他的众女儿。
{Num 36:3}  But if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the people of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry. So it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
{Num 36:3}  他们若嫁以色列别支派的人，就必将我们祖宗所遗留的产业加在他们丈夫支派的产业中。这样，我们拈阄所得的产业就要减少了。
{Num 36:4}  And when the jubilee of the people of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry, and their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."
{Num 36:4}  到了以色列人的禧年，这女儿的产业就必加在他们丈夫支派的产业上。这样，我们祖宗支派的产业就减少了。”
{Num 36:5}  And Moses commanded the people of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, "The tribe of the people of Joseph is right.
{Num 36:5}  摩西照耶和华的话吩咐以色列人说：“约瑟支派的人说得有理。
{Num 36:6}  This is what the LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: 'Let them marry whom they think best, only they shall marry within the clan of the tribe of their father.
{Num 36:6}  论到西罗非哈的众女儿，耶和华这样吩咐说：他们可以随意嫁人，只是要嫁同宗支派的人。
{Num 36:7}  The inheritance of the people of Israel shall not be transferred from one tribe to another, for every one of the people of Israel shall hold on to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
{Num 36:7}  这样，以色列人的产业就不从这支派归到那支派，因为以色列人要各守各祖宗支派的产业。
{Num 36:8}  And every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the people of Israel shall be wife to one of the clan of the tribe of her father, so that every one of the people of Israel may possess the inheritance of his fathers.
{Num 36:8}  凡在以色列支派中得了产业的女子必作同宗支派人的妻，好叫以色列人各自承受他祖宗的产业。
{Num 36:9}  So no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another, for each of the tribes of the people of Israel shall hold on to its own inheritance.'"
{Num 36:9}  这样，他们的产业就不从这支派归到那支派，因为以色列支派的人要各守各的产业。”
{Num 36:10} The daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD commanded Moses,
{Num 36:10} 耶和华怎样吩咐摩西，西罗非哈的众女儿就怎样行。
{Num 36:11} for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to sons of their father's brothers.
{Num 36:11} 西罗非哈的女儿玛拉、得撒、曷拉、密迦、挪阿都嫁了他们伯叔的儿子。
{Num 36:12} They were married into the clans of the people of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father's clan.
{Num 36:12} 他们嫁入约瑟儿子、玛拿西子孙的族中；他们的产业仍留在同宗支派中。
{Num 36:13} These are the commandments and the rules that the LORD commanded through Moses to the people of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
{Num 36:13} 这是耶和华在摩押平原约但河边、耶利哥对面藉着摩西所吩咐以色列人的命令典章。
