{Luk 1:1}   Inasmuch /inas'mCtS/ as [Phr.conj 鉴于] many have undertaken /Cndcr'tAk/[着手承担] to compile /kcm'pIl/[编译] a narrative /nxrativ/[叙述文体 < nar短小] of the things that have been accomplished among us,
{Luk 1:1}   提阿非罗大人哪，有好些人提笔作书，述说在我们中间所成就的事，是照传道的人从起初亲眼看见又传给我们的。
{Luk 1:2}   just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses /I'witnes/[目击者] and ministers [皇帝的仆人 < 小身份] of the word have delivered them to us,
{Luk 1:2}   (SEE 1:1)
{Luk 1:3}   it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, [Phr.prep 为过去一段时间] to write an orderly [有次序地] account /a'kaunt/[计算单] for you, most excellent /ekselent/[优秀的] Theophilus, /thE'ofilCs/
{Luk 1:3}   这些事我既从起头都详细考察了，就定意要按着次序写给你，
{Luk 1:4}   that you may have certainty /scrtanty/[确实之事] concerning [关系到] the things you have been taught.
{Luk 1:4}   使你知道所学之道都是确实的。
{Luk 1:5}   In the days of Herod, king of Judea, /dZUdEa/ there was a priest /prEst/[牧师 < 站在前面的人] named Zechariah, /zekar'rIa/ of the division /di'viZCn/[分开 部门] of Abijah. /a'bIdZa/ And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, /ArCn/ and her name was Elizabeth. /E'lizabeth/
{Luk 1:5}   当犹太王希律的时候，亚比雅班里有一个祭司，名叫撒迦利亚；他妻子是亚伦的后人，名叫以利沙伯。
{Luk 1:6}   And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly /blAmles/ in all the commandments and statutes /stxtSUt/[规定 法规 < st站立 定型] of the Lord.
{Luk 1:6}   他们二人在神面前都是义人，遵行主的一切诫命礼仪，没有可指摘的，
{Luk 1:7}   But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, /bxren/ and both were advanced [前进 先进 高等 年老 < ad前 v动] in years.
{Luk 1:7}   只是没有孩子；因为以利沙伯不生育，两个人又年纪老迈了。
{Luk 1:8}   Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, /dwty/[责任]
{Luk 1:8}   撒迦利亚按班次在神面前供祭司的职分，
{Luk 1:9}   according to the custom of the priesthood, [祭司职份] he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. /in'sense/
{Luk 1:9}   照祭司的规矩掣签，得进主殿烧香。
{Luk 1:10}  And the whole multitude [成倍的 大量多数的] of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.
{Luk 1:10}  烧香的时候，众百姓在外面祷告。
{Luk 1:11}  And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar /altar/[祭坛] of incense.
{Luk 1:11}  有主的使者站在香坛的右边，向他显现。
{Luk 1:12}  And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear [n.恐惧] fell upon [Phr.v 落在] him.
{Luk 1:12}  撒迦利亚看见，就惊慌害怕。
{Luk 1:13}  But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear [生给] you a son, and you shall call his name John.
{Luk 1:13}  天使对他说：“撒迦利亚，不要害怕，因为你的祈祷已经被听见了。你的妻子以利沙伯要给你生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫约翰。
{Luk 1:14}  And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,
{Luk 1:14}  你必欢喜快乐；有许多人因他出世，也必喜乐。
{Luk 1:15}  for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. /wwm/
{Luk 1:15}  他在主面前将要为大，淡酒浓酒都不喝，从母腹里就被圣灵充满了。
{Luk 1:16}  And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God,
{Luk 1:16}  他要使许多以色列人回转，归于主他们的神。
{Luk 1:17}  and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, /E'lIdZa/ to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient /disO'bEdient/[不顺从的] to the wisdom of the just, [正直] to make ready for the Lord a people prepared." /prE'pAr/
{Luk 1:17}  他必有以利亚的心志能力，行在主的前面，叫为父的心转向儿女，叫悖逆的人转从义人的智慧，又为主预备合用的百姓。”
{Luk 1:18}  And Zechariah said to the angel, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."
{Luk 1:18}  撒迦利亚对天使说：“我凭着什么可知道这事呢？我已经老了，我的妻子也年纪老迈了。”
{Luk 1:19}  And the angel answered him, "I am Gabriel. /gAbriel/ I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
{Luk 1:19}  天使回答说：“我是站在神面前的加百列，奉差而来对你说话，将这好信息报给你。
{Luk 1:20}  And behold, you will be silent /sIlent/ and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time."
{Luk 1:20}  到了时候，这话必然应验；只因你不信，你必哑巴，不能说话，直到这事成就的日子。”
{Luk 1:21}  And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay /dE'lA/[de加强 lay躺 > 耽搁] in the temple.
{Luk 1:21}  百姓等候撒迦利亚，诧异他许久在殿里。
{Luk 1:22}  And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision /viZCn/ in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. /mUt/[哑 < m不动]
{Luk 1:22}  及至他出来，不能和他们说话，他们就知道他在殿里见了异象；因为他直向他们打手式，竟成了哑巴。
{Luk 1:23}  And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.
{Luk 1:23}  他供职的日子已满，就回家去了。
{Luk 1:24}  After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying,
{Luk 1:24}  这些日子以后，他的妻子以利沙伯怀了孕，就隐藏了五个月，
{Luk 1:25}  "Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach /rE'prOtS/[责备 耻辱] among people."
{Luk 1:25}  说：“主在眷顾我的日子，这样看待我，要把我在人间的羞耻除掉。”
{Luk 1:26}  In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
{Luk 1:26}  到了第六个月，天使加百列奉神的差遣往加利利的一座城去（这城名叫拿撒勒），
{Luk 1:27}  to a virgin /vcrdZin/ betrothed /bE'trOth/ to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary.
{Luk 1:27}  到一个童女那里，是已经许配大卫家的一个人，名叫约瑟。童女的名字叫马利亚；
{Luk 1:28}  And he came to her and said, "Greetings, O favored /fAvcr/[好感 好意] one, the Lord is with you!"
{Luk 1:28}  天使进去，对他说：“蒙大恩的女子，我问你安，主和你同在了！”
{Luk 1:29}  But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern /di'scrn/[s分离 > 辨别] what sort [s分离 > 分类 类型] of greeting this might be.
{Luk 1:29}  马利亚因这话就很惊慌，又反复思想这样问安是什么意思。
{Luk 1:30}  And the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found [遇见 发现] favor with God.
{Luk 1:30}  天使对他说：“马利亚，不要怕！你在神面前已经蒙恩了。
{Luk 1:31}  And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
{Luk 1:31}  你要怀孕生子，可以给他起名叫耶稣。
{Luk 1:32}  He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne /thrOn/[thr更伸长 > 最高的地位 > 王位] of his father David,
{Luk 1:32}  他要为大，称为至高者的儿子；主神要把他祖大卫的位给他。
{Luk 1:33}  and he will reign /rAn/ over [Phr.v 统治] the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end."
{Luk 1:33}  他要作雅各家的王，直到永远；他的国也没有穷尽。”
{Luk 1:34}  And Mary said to the angel, "How will this be, since I am a virgin?"
{Luk 1:34}  马利亚对天使说：“我没有出嫁，怎么有这事呢？”
{Luk 1:35}  And the angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow /ovcr'SxdO/ you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God.
{Luk 1:35}  天使回答说：“圣灵要临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你，因此所要生的圣者必称为神的儿子（或作：所要生的，必称为圣，称为神的儿子）。
{Luk 1:36}  And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived /kCn'sEv/[con一起 ceiv拿 > 一起接受 > 持有 1.身体持有 > 孕育 2.脑袋持有 > 构思] a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.
{Luk 1:36}  况且你的亲戚以利沙伯，在年老的时候也怀了男胎，就是那素来称为不生育的，现在有孕六个月了。
{Luk 1:37}  For nothing will be impossible with God."
{Luk 1:37}  因为，出于神的话，没有一句不带能力的。”
{Luk 1:38}  And Mary said, "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her.
{Luk 1:38}  马利亚说：“我是主的使女，情愿照你的话成就在我身上。”天使就离开他去了。
{Luk 1:39}  In those days Mary arose and went with haste /hAst/[匆忙 急忙声拟音] into the hill country, to a town in Judah,
{Luk 1:39}  那时候，马利亚起身，急忙往山地里去，来到犹大的一座城；
{Luk 1:40}  and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted /grEt/[gr逐级动 > 走动 ee近 > 靠近 > 问安] Elizabeth.
{Luk 1:40}  进了撒迦利亚的家，问以利沙伯安。
{Luk 1:41}  And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped /lEp/[l拉动 ea上 p突破 > 跳跃] in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,
{Luk 1:41}  以利沙伯一听马利亚问安，所怀的胎就在腹里跳动。以利沙伯且被圣灵充满，
{Luk 1:42}  and she exclaimed /eks'klAm/ with a loud /laud/ cry, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
{Luk 1:42}  高声喊着说：“你在妇女中是有福的！你所怀的胎也是有福的！
{Luk 1:43}  And why is this granted [gr逐级 > 授权 同意 授予] to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

{Luk 1:46}  And Mary said, "My soul magnifies /mxgnifI/[ma大 > 放大] the Lord,
{Luk 1:46}  马利亚说：我心尊主为大；
{Luk 1:47}  and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
{Luk 1:47}  我灵以神我的救主为乐；
{Luk 1:48}  for he has looked on the humble /hCmbl/[卑微 > 低感觉拟音] estate /es'tAt/ [st停止 状态 阶层 不动产] of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;
{Luk 1:48}  因为他顾念他使女的卑微；从今以后，万代要称我有福。

{Luk 1:51}  他用膀臂施展大能；那狂傲的人正心里妄想就被他赶散了。
{Luk 1:52}  he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted /eg'zalt/[ex出 拿出 抬举 > 提升 加强] those of humble estate;

{Luk 1:55}  为要记念亚伯拉罕和他的后裔，施怜悯直到永远，正如从前对我们列祖所说的话。
{Luk 1:56}  And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.
{Luk 1:56}  马利亚和以利沙伯同住，约有三个月，就回家去了。
{Luk 1:57}  Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.
{Luk 1:57}  以利沙伯的产期到了，就生了一个儿子。
{Luk 1:58}  And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
{Luk 1:58}  邻里亲族听见主向他大施怜悯，就和他一同欢乐。

{Luk 2:4}   约瑟也从加利利的拿撒勒城上犹太去，到了大卫的城，名叫伯利恒，因他本是大卫一族一家的人，

{Luk 2:8}   And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock [fl散发拉长 > 群 > 羊群] by night.
{Luk 2:8}   在伯利恒之野地里有牧羊的人，夜间按着更次看守羊群。

{Luk 2:15}  众天使离开他们，升天去了。牧羊的人彼此说：“我们往伯利恒去，看看所成的事，就是主所指示我们的。”

{Luk 2:19}  But Mary treasured /treZcr/[tr伸出 > 不可多得 > 财宝 > 珍藏] up all these things, pondering [pond悬挂 > 粘住声拟音 > 衡量 深思] them in her heart.
{Luk 2:19}  马利亚却把这一切的事存在心里，反覆思想。
{Luk 2:20}  And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.
{Luk 2:20}  牧羊的人回去了，因所听见所看见的一切事，正如天使向他们所说的，就归荣耀与神，赞美他。
{Luk 2:21}  And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
{Luk 2:21}  满了八天，就给孩子行割礼，与他起名叫耶稣；这就是没有成胎以前，天使所起的名。

{Luk 2:22}  按摩西律法满了洁净的日子，他们带着孩子上耶路撒冷去，要把他献与主。
{Luk 2:23}  (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord")
{Luk 2:23}  （正如主的律法上所记：“凡头生的男子必称圣归主；”）
{Luk 2:24}  and to offer /ofcr/[f给予 拿出 > 提供] a sacrifice /sxkrifIs/[献祭] according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, "a pair of turtledoves, /tcrtl,dCv/ or two young pigeons." /pidZECn/

{Luk 2:25}  在耶路撒冷有一个人，名叫西面；这人又公义又虔诚，素常盼望以色列的安慰者来到，又有圣灵在他身上。
{Luk 2:26}  And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
{Luk 2:26}  他得了圣灵的启示，知道自己未死以前，必看见主所立的基督。

{Luk 2:27}  他受了圣灵的感动，进入圣殿，正遇见耶稣的父母抱着孩子进来，要照律法的规矩办理。
{Luk 2:28}  he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,
{Luk 2:28}  西面就用手接过他来，称颂神说：
{Luk 2:29}  "Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word;
{Luk 2:29}  主啊！如今可以照你的话，释放仆人安然去世；
{Luk 2:30}  for my eyes have seen your salvation /sxl'vASCn/
{Luk 2:30}  因为我的眼睛已经看见你的救恩，
{Luk 2:31}  that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
{Luk 2:31}  就是你在万民面前所预备的：
{Luk 2:32}  a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel."
{Luk 2:32}  是照亮外邦人的光，又是你民以色列的荣耀。
{Luk 2:33}  And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.
{Luk 2:33}  孩子的父母因这论耶稣的话就希奇。
{Luk 2:34}  And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, "Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed
{Luk 2:34}  西面给他们祝福，又对孩子的母亲马利亚说：“这孩子被立，是要叫以色列中许多人跌倒，许多人兴起；又要作毁谤的话柄，叫许多人心里的意念显露出来；你自己的心也要被刀刺透。”
{Luk 2:35}  (and a sword will pierce /pErs/[刺透] through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed."
{Luk 2:35}  (SEE 2:34)
{Luk 2:36}  And there was a prophetess, [ess女 > 女先知] Anna, /xna/ the daughter of Phanuel, /fanUel/ of the tribe /trIb/[tri三分之一 > 部落 部族] of Asher. /xScr/ She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin,
{Luk 2:36}  又有女先知，名叫亚拿，是亚设支派法内力的女儿，年纪已经老迈，从作童女出嫁的时候，同丈夫住了七年就寡居了，
{Luk 2:37}  and then as a widow /widO/[寡妇] until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.
{Luk 2:37}  现在已经八十四岁（或作：就寡居了八十四年），并不离开圣殿，禁食祈求，昼夜事奉神。
{Luk 2:38}  And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption /rE'dempSCn/[救赎] of Jerusalem.
{Luk 2:38}  正当那时，他进前来称谢神，将孩子的事对一切盼望耶路撒冷得救赎的人讲说。
{Luk 2:39}  And when they had performed /pcr'form/ everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
{Luk 2:39}  约瑟和马利亚照主的律法办完了一切的事，就回加利利，到自己的城拿撒勒去了。

{Luk 2:41}  每年到逾越节，他父母就上耶路撒冷去。
{Luk 2:42}  And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom.
{Luk 2:42}  当他十二岁的时候，他们按着节期的规矩上去。
{Luk 2:43}  And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind [Phr.v留在后头 留下来] in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,
{Luk 2:43}  守满了节期，他们回去，孩童耶稣仍旧在耶路撒冷。他的父母并不知道，
{Luk 2:44}  but supposing him to be in the group /grwp/ they went a day's journey, /dZcrnE/ but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances, /a'kwAntans/[熟人]
{Luk 2:44}  以为他在同行的人中间，走了一天的路程，就在亲族和熟识的人中找他，
{Luk 2:45}  and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him.
{Luk 2:45}  既找不着，就回耶路撒冷去找他。
{Luk 2:46}  After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
{Luk 2:46}  过了三天，就遇见他在殿里，坐在教师中间，一面听，一面问。
{Luk 2:47}  And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
{Luk 2:47}  凡听见他的，都希奇他的聪明和他的应对。
{Luk 2:48}  And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. /as'toniS/ And his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated [对待] us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress." /dis'tres/[悲痛]
{Luk 2:48}  他父母看见就很希奇。他母亲对他说：“我儿！为什么向我们这样行呢？看哪！你父亲和我伤心来找你！”
{Luk 2:49}  And he said to them, "Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?"
{Luk 2:49}  耶稣说：“为什么找我呢？岂不知我应当以我父的事为念吗（或作：岂不知我应当在我父的家里吗）？”
{Luk 2:50}  And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them.
{Luk 2:50}  他所说的这话，他们不明白。
{Luk 2:51}  And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive /sCb'missiv/[sub下 m不动 > 顺从] to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart.
{Luk 2:51}  他就同他们下去，回到拿撒勒，并且顺从他们。他母亲把这一切的事都存在心里。
{Luk 2:52}  And Jesus increased /in'krEs/ in wisdom and in stature /stxtScr/[st停止 状态 > 身高 身量] and in favor with God and man.
{Luk 2:52}  耶稣的智慧和身量（或作：年纪），并神和人喜爱他的心，都一齐增长。
{Luk 3:1}   In the fifteenth year of the reign /rAn/ of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch [四分之一之王 > 小王] of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea /iturAEa/ and Trachonitis, /trakOnitis/ and Lysanias /li'sAnias/ tetrarch of Abilene, /a'bilEn/

{Luk 3:2}   during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
{Luk 3:2}   亚那和该亚法作大祭司。那时，撒迦利亚的儿子约翰在旷野里，神的话临到他。
{Luk 3:3}   And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
{Luk 3:3}   他就来到约但河一带地方，宣讲悔改的洗礼，使罪得赦。
{Luk 3:4}   As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
{Luk 3:4}   正如先知以赛亚书上所记的话，说：在旷野有人声喊着说：预备主的道，修直他的路！
{Luk 3:5}   Every valley /vxllE/ shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked /kruk/[c弯曲] shall become straight, [str延长 > 直线] and the rough /rcf/[高低不平 粗糙] places shall become level [lev上升 > 等级 水平线] ways,
{Luk 3:5}   一切山洼都要填满；大小山冈都要削平！弯弯曲曲的地方要改为正直；高高低低的道路要改为平坦！
{Luk 3:6}   and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'"
{Luk 3:6}   凡有血气的，都要见神的救恩！
{Luk 3:7}   He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
{Luk 3:7}   约翰对那出来要受他洗的众人说：“毒蛇的种类！谁指示你们逃避将来的忿怒呢？
{Luk 3:8}   Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
{Luk 3:8}   你们要结出果子来，与悔改的心相称。不要自己心里说：‘有亚伯拉罕为我们的祖宗。’我告诉你们，神能从这些石头中，给亚伯拉罕兴起子孙来。
{Luk 3:9}   Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
{Luk 3:9}   现在斧子已经放在树根上，凡不结好果子的树就砍下来，丢在火里。”
{Luk 3:10}  And the crowds asked him, "What then shall we do?"
{Luk 3:10}  众人问他说：“这样，我们当作什么呢？”
{Luk 3:11}  And he answered them, "Whoever has two tunics is to share /SAr/ with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise."
{Luk 3:11}  约翰回答说：“有两件衣裳的，就分给那没有的；有食物的，也当这样行。”
{Luk 3:12}  Tax /txks/ collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"
{Luk 3:12}  又有税吏来要受洗，问他说：“夫子，我们当做什么呢？”
{Luk 3:13}  And he said to them, "Collect /kol'lekt/ no more than [Phr.conj不多于] you are authorized /othOrIz/ to do."
{Luk 3:13}  约翰说：“除了例定的数目，不要多取。”
{Luk 3:14}  Soldiers also asked him, "And we, what shall we do?" And he said to them, "Do not extort /eks'tort/[拧出 > 强要 敲诈 勒索] money from anyone by threats /thret/[恐吓声 感觉拟音] or by false accusation, /xkU'zASCn/[控告] and be content [包含 > 含量 内容 目录 满足] with your wages." /wAdZ/
{Luk 3:14}  又有兵丁问他说：“我们当做什么呢？”约翰说：“不要以强暴待人，也不要讹诈人，自己有钱粮就当知足。”
{Luk 3:15}  As the people were in expectation, /ekspek'tASCn/ and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ,
{Luk 3:15}  百姓指望基督来的时候，人都心里猜疑，或者约翰是基督。
{Luk 3:16}  John answered them all, saying, "I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap /strxp/ of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
{Luk 3:16}  约翰说：“我是用水给你们施洗，但有一位能力比我更大的要来，我就是给他解鞋带也不配。他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。
{Luk 3:17}  His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."
{Luk 3:17}  他手里拿着簸箕，要扬净他的场，把麦子收在仓里，把糠用不灭的火烧尽了。”
{Luk 3:18}  So with many other exhortations /egzor'tASCn/[ex出 or心 > 劝诫] he preached good news to the people.
{Luk 3:18}  约翰又用许多别的话劝百姓，向他们传福音。
{Luk 3:19}  But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved /rE'pruv/ by him for Herodias, /he'rOdias/ his brother's wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done,
{Luk 3:19}  只是分封的王希律，因他兄弟之妻希罗底的缘故，并因他所行的一切恶事，受了约翰的责备；
{Luk 3:20}  added this to them all, that he locked up John in prison.
{Luk 3:20}  又另外添了一件，就是把约翰收在监里。
{Luk 3:21}  Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened,
{Luk 3:21}  众百姓都受了洗，耶稣也受了洗。正祷告的时候，天就开了，
{Luk 3:22}  and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, [f形状] like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."
{Luk 3:22}  圣灵降临在他身上，形状彷佛鸽子；又有声音从天上来，说：“你是我的爱子，我喜悦你。”

{Luk 4:4}   And Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'"
{Luk 4:4}   耶稣回答说：“经上记着说：‘人活着不是单靠食物，乃是靠神口里所出的一切话。’”
{Luk 4:5}   And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment [=move动一下的时间] of time,
{Luk 4:5}   魔鬼又领他上了高山，霎时间把天下的万国都指给他看，

{Luk 4:16}  耶稣来到拿撒勒，就是他长大的地方。在安息日，照他平常的规矩进了会堂，站起来要念圣经。

{Luk 4:17}  有人把先知以赛亚的书交给他，他就打开，找到一处写着说：
{Luk 4:18}  "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty /libcrty/ to the captives /kxptiv/[cap抓住 > 俘虏] and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty [Phr.v释放] those who are oppressed, /C'pres/
{Luk 4:18}  主的灵在我身上，因为他用膏膏我，叫我传福音给贫穷的人；差遣我报告：被掳的得释放，瞎眼的得看见，叫那受压制的得自由，
{Luk 4:19}  to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."
{Luk 4:19}  报告神悦纳人的禧年。
{Luk 4:20}  And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant /a'tendant/ and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.
{Luk 4:20}  于是把书卷起来，交还执事，就坐下。会堂里的人都定睛看他。
{Luk 4:21}  And he began to say to them, "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."
{Luk 4:21}  耶稣对他们说：“今天这经应验在你们耳中了。”
{Luk 4:22}  And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious [恩惠 高尚 优雅] words that were coming from his mouth. /mauth/ And they said, "Is not this Joseph's son?"
{Luk 4:22}  众人都称赞他，并希奇他口中所出的恩言；又说：“这不是约瑟的儿子吗？”
{Luk 4:23}  And he said to them, "Doubtless /daut/[怀疑 < double二者之间] you will quote to me this proverb, /provcrb/ '"Physician, /fi'ziSCn/ heal yourself." What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.'"
{Luk 4:23}  耶稣对他们说：“你们必引这俗语向我说：‘医生，你医治自己吧！我们听见你在迦百农所行的事，也当行在你自己家乡里’”；
{Luk 4:24}  And he said, "Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable /ak'sept/ in his hometown.
{Luk 4:24}  又说：“我实在告诉你们，没有先知在自己家乡被人悦纳的。
{Luk 4:25}  But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine /fxmin/ came over all the land,
{Luk 4:25}  我对你们说实话，当以利亚的时候，天闭塞了三年零六个月，遍地有大饥荒，那时，以色列中有许多寡妇，
{Luk 4:26}  and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, /zxrefath/ in the land of Sidon, /sIdCn/ to a woman who was a widow.
{Luk 4:26}  以利亚并没有奉差往他们一个人那里去，只奉差往西顿的撒勒法一个寡妇那里去。
{Luk 4:27}  And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman /nAaman/ the Syrian." /sirian/
{Luk 4:27}  先知以利沙的时候，以色列中有许多长大麻疯的，但内中除了叙利亚国的乃缦，没有一个得洁净的。”
{Luk 4:28}  When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath.
{Luk 4:28}  会堂里的人听见这话，都怒气满胸，
{Luk 4:29}  And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow /brau/[额头 悬崖边] of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff. [cl倾斜 > 悬崖峭壁]
{Luk 4:29}  就起来撵他出城（他们的城造在山上）；他们带他到山崖，要把他推下去。
{Luk 4:30}  But passing through their midst, he went away.
{Luk 4:30}  他却从他们中间直行，过去了。
{Luk 4:31}  And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath,
{Luk 4:31}  耶稣下到迦百农，就是加利利的一座城，在安息日教训众人。
{Luk 4:32}  and they were astonished /as'toniS/ at his teaching, for his word possessed /pC'zes/[pos放置 > 占有 支配 持有] authority.
{Luk 4:32}  他们很希奇他的教训，因为他的话里有权柄。
{Luk 4:33}  And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
{Luk 4:33}  在会堂里有一个人，被污鬼的精气附着，大声喊叫说：
{Luk 4:34}  "Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God."
{Luk 4:34}  “唉！拿撒勒的耶稣，我们与你有什么相干？你来灭我们吗？我知道你是谁，乃是神的圣者。”
{Luk 4:35}  But Jesus rebuked /rE'bUk/ him, saying, "Be silent and come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm.
{Luk 4:35}  耶稣责备他说：“不要作声，从这人身上出来吧！”鬼把那人摔倒在众人中间，就出来了，却也没有害他。
{Luk 4:36}  And they were all amazed /a'mAz/ and said to one another, "What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!"
{Luk 4:36}  众人都惊讶，彼此对问说：“这是什么道理呢？因为他用权柄能力吩咐污鬼，污鬼就出来。”
{Luk 4:37}  And reports about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
{Luk 4:37}  于是耶稣的名声传遍了周围地方。
{Luk 4:38}  And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, /fEvcr/ and they appealed /a'pEl/[请求] to him on her behalf. /bE'hxf/
{Luk 4:38}  耶稣出了会堂，进了西门的家。西门的岳母害热病甚重，有人为他求耶稣。
{Luk 4:39}  And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she rose and began to serve them.
{Luk 4:39}  耶稣站在他旁边，斥责那热病，热就退了。他立刻起来服事他们。
{Luk 4:40}  Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various /vxriCs/ diseases brought them to him, and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.
{Luk 4:40}  日落的时候，凡有病人的，不论害什么病，都带到耶稣那里。耶稣按手在他们各人身上，医好他们。
{Luk 4:41}  And demons also came out of many, crying, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow /al'lau/ them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
{Luk 4:41}  又有鬼从好些人身上出来，喊着说：“你是神的儿子。”耶稣斥责他们，不许他们说话。因为他们知道他是基督。
{Luk 4:42}  And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate /desOlAt/[de强调 sol单独 > 荒凉] place. And the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from leaving them,
{Luk 4:42}  天亮的时候，耶稣出来，走到旷野地方。众人去找他，到了他那里，要留住他，不要他离开他们。
{Luk 4:43}  but he said to them, "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well; for I was sent for this purpose."
{Luk 4:43}  但耶稣对他们说：“我也必须在别城传神国的福音，因我奉差原是为此。”
{Luk 4:44}  And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
{Luk 4:44}  于是耶稣在加利利的各会堂传道。
{Luk 5:1}   On one occasion, /C'kAZCn/[case < 场合 时机] while the crowd was pressing in [Phr.v压入 挤入] on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, /ge'nesaret/
{Luk 5:1}   耶稣站在革尼撒勒湖边，众人拥挤他，要听神的道。
{Luk 5:2}   and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.
{Luk 5:2}   他见有两只船湾在湖边；打鱼的人却离开船洗网去了。
{Luk 5:3}   Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
{Luk 5:3}   有一只船是西门的，耶稣就上去，请他把船撑开，稍微离岸，就坐下，从船上教训众人。
{Luk 5:4}   And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch."
{Luk 5:4}   讲完了，对西门说：“把船开到水深之处，下网打鱼。”
{Luk 5:5}   And Simon answered, "Master, we toiled [苦干] all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets."
{Luk 5:5}   西门说：“夫子，我们整夜劳力，并没有打着什么。但依从你的话，我就下网。”
{Luk 5:6}   And when they had done this, they enclosed [接近 关住 围住] a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking.
{Luk 5:6}   他们下了网，就圈住许多鱼，网险些裂开，
{Luk 5:7}   They signaled [信号] to their partners [同伴] in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. [下沉]
{Luk 5:7}   便招呼那只船上的同伴来帮助。他们就来，把鱼装满了两只船，甚至船要沉下去。
{Luk 5:8}   But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
{Luk 5:8}   西门彼得看见，就俯伏在耶稣膝前，说：“主啊！离开我，我是个罪人！”
{Luk 5:9}   For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,
{Luk 5:9}   他和一切同在的人都惊讶这一网所打的鱼。
{Luk 5:10}  and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men."
{Luk 5:10}  他的夥伴西庇太的儿子雅各、约翰，也是这样。耶稣对西门说：“不要怕！从今以后，你要得人了。”
{Luk 5:11}  And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.
{Luk 5:11}  他们把两只船拢了岸，就撇下所有的，跟从了耶稣。
{Luk 5:12}  While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy. /leprOsy/ And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."
{Luk 5:12}  有一回，耶稣在一个城里，有人满身长了大麻疯，看见他，就俯伏在地，求他说：“主若肯，必能叫我洁净了。”
{Luk 5:13}  And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." And immediately the leprosy left him.
{Luk 5:13}  耶稣伸手摸他，说：“我肯，你洁净了吧！”大麻疯立刻就离了他的身。
{Luk 5:14}  And he charged [装载] him to tell no one, but "go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to them."
{Luk 5:14}  耶稣嘱咐他：“你切不可告诉人，只要去把身体给祭司察看，又要为你得了洁净，照摩西所吩咐的献上礼物，对众人作证据。”
{Luk 5:15}  But now even more the report about him went abroad, /a'brod/ and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities. /in'fcrmity/[虚弱 病症]
{Luk 5:15}  但耶稣的名声越发传扬出去。有极多的人聚集来听道，也指望医治他们的病。
{Luk 5:16}  But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.
{Luk 5:16}  耶稣却退到旷野去祷告。
{Luk 5:17}  On one of those days, as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with him to heal.
{Luk 5:17}  有一天，耶稣教训人，有法利赛人和教法师在旁边坐着；他们是从加利利各乡村和犹太并耶路撒冷来的。主的能力与耶稣同在，使他能医治病人。
{Luk 5:18}  And behold, some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, /pxralIz/ and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus,
{Luk 5:18}  有人用褥子抬着一个瘫子，要抬进去放在耶稣面前，
{Luk 5:19}  but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof [屋顶] and let him down with his bed through the tiles /tIl/[瓦] into the midst before Jesus.
{Luk 5:19}  却因人多，寻不出法子抬进去，就上了房顶，从瓦间把他连褥子缒到当中，正在耶稣面前。
{Luk 5:20}  And when he saw their faith, he said, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."
{Luk 5:20}  耶稣见他们的信心，就对瘫子说：“你的罪赦了。”
{Luk 5:21}  And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? /blxsfemy/ Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
{Luk 5:21}  文士和法利赛人就议论说：“这说僭妄话的是谁？除了神以外，谁能赦罪呢？”
{Luk 5:22}  When Jesus perceived /pcr'sEv/[完全抓住 > 觉察到] their thoughts, he answered them, "Why do you question in your hearts?
{Luk 5:22}  耶稣知道他们所议论的，就说：“你们心里议论的是什么呢？
{Luk 5:23}  Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?
{Luk 5:23}  或说‘你的罪赦了’，或说‘你起来行走’，那一样容易呢？
{Luk 5:24}  But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"—he said to the man who was paralyzed—"I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home."
{Luk 5:24}  但要叫你们知道，人子在地上有赦罪的权柄。”就对瘫子说：“我吩咐你，起来，拿你的褥子回家去吧！”
{Luk 5:25}  And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God.
{Luk 5:25}  那人当众人面前立刻起来，拿着他所躺卧的褥子回家去，归荣耀与神。
{Luk 5:26}  And amazement seized /sEz/[抓住] them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, /o/ saying, "We have seen extraordinary /eks'trordinary/[非凡] things today."
{Luk 5:26}  众人都惊奇，也归荣耀与神，并且满心惧怕，说：“我们今日看见非常的事了。”
{Luk 5:27}  After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, /lEvI/ sitting at the tax booth. [摊亭] And he said to him, "Follow me."
{Luk 5:27}  这事以后，耶稣出去，看见一个税吏，名叫利未，坐在税关上，就对他说：“你跟从我来。”
{Luk 5:28}  And leaving everything, he rose and followed him.
{Luk 5:28}  他就撇下所有的，起来，跟从了耶稣。
{Luk 5:29}  And Levi made him a great feast in his house, and there was a large company of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them.
{Luk 5:29}  利未在自己家里为耶稣大摆筵席，有许多税吏和别人与他们一同坐席。
{Luk 5:30}  And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled /grCmbl/ at his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
{Luk 5:30}  法利赛人和文士就向耶稣的门徒发怨言说：“你们为什么和税吏并罪人一同吃喝呢？”
{Luk 5:31}  And Jesus answered them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
{Luk 5:31}  耶稣对他们说：“无病的人用不着医生，有病的人才用得着。
{Luk 5:32}  I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance."
{Luk 5:32}  我来本不是召义人悔改，乃是召罪人悔改。”
{Luk 5:33}  And they said to him, "The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink."
{Luk 5:33}  他们说：“约翰的门徒屡次禁食祈祷，法利赛人的门徒也是这样；惟独你的门徒又吃又喝。”
{Luk 5:34}  And Jesus said to them, "Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?
{Luk 5:34}  耶稣对他们说：“新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候，岂能叫陪伴之人禁食呢？
{Luk 5:35}  The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days."
{Luk 5:35}  但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那日他们就要禁食了。”
{Luk 5:36}  He also told them a parable: /pxrabl/[对比 比较 > 比喻] "No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. If he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match /mxtS/[m吻合 > 相配 m中间 > 蜡烛芯] the old.
{Luk 5:36}  耶稣又设一个比喻，对他们说：“没有人把新衣服撕下一块来补在旧衣服上；若是这样，就把新的撕破了，并且所撕下来的那块新的和旧的也不相称。
{Luk 5:37}  And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst /bcrst/ the skins and it will be spilled, [溢流] and the skins will be destroyed.
{Luk 5:37}  也没有人把新酒装在旧皮袋里；若是这样，新酒必将皮袋裂开，酒便漏出来，皮袋也就坏了。
{Luk 5:38}  But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
{Luk 5:38}  但新酒必须装在新皮袋里。
{Luk 5:39}  And no one after drinking old wine desires /dE'zIr/ new, for he says, 'The old is good.'"
{Luk 5:39}  没有人喝了陈酒又想喝新的；他总说陈的好。”
{Luk 6:1}   On a Sabbath, while he was going through the grainfields, /grAnfEld/[谷田地] his disciples plucked /plck/[摘拔] and ate some heads of grain, rubbing /rCb/[r转动 > 摩擦] them in their hands.
{Luk 6:1}   有一个安息日，耶稣从麦地经过。他的门徒掐了麦穗，用手搓着吃。
{Luk 6:2}   But some of the Pharisees said, "Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"
{Luk 6:2}   有几个法利赛人说：“你们为什么作安息日不可作的事呢？”
{Luk 6:3}   And Jesus answered them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:
{Luk 6:3}   耶稣对他们说：“经上记着大卫和跟从他的人饥饿之时所做的事，连这个你们也没有念过吗？
{Luk 6:4}   how he entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those with him?"
{Luk 6:4}   他怎么进了神的殿，拿陈设饼吃，又给跟从的人吃？这饼除了祭司以外，别人都不可吃。”
{Luk 6:5}   And he said to them, "The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."
{Luk 6:5}   又对他们说：“人子是安息日的主。”
{Luk 6:6}   On another Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was withered. /widhcr/[枯萎 < 暴露于天气中]
{Luk 6:6}   又有一个安息日，耶稣进了会堂教训人，在那里有一个人右手枯干了。
{Luk 6:7}   And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse /a'kUs/ him.
{Luk 6:7}   文士和法利赛人窥探耶稣，在安息日治病不治病，要得把柄去告他。
{Luk 6:8}   But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man with the withered hand, "Come and stand here." And he rose and stood there.
{Luk 6:8}   耶稣却知道他们的意念，就对那枯干一只手的人说：“起来！站在当中。”那人就起来，站着。
{Luk 6:9}   And Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?"
{Luk 6:9}   耶稣对他们说：“我问你们，在安息日行善行恶，救命害命，那样是可以的呢？”
{Luk 6:10}  And after looking around at them all he said to him, "Stretch out your hand." And he did so, and his hand was restored. /rE'stord/
{Luk 6:10}  他就周围看着他们众人，对那人说：“伸出手来！”他把手一伸，手就复了原。
{Luk 6:11}  But they were filled with fury /fUry/ and discussed /dis'kCs/ with one another what they might do to Jesus.
{Luk 6:11}  他们就满心大怒，彼此商议怎样处治耶稣。
{Luk 6:12}  In these days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God.
{Luk 6:12}  那时，耶稣出去，上山祷告，整夜祷告神；
{Luk 6:13}  And when day came, he called his disciples and chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles: /a'posl/
{Luk 6:13}  到了天亮，叫他的门徒来，就从他们中间挑选十二个人，称他们为使徒。
{Luk 6:14}  Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew, /bar'tholOmU/
{Luk 6:14}  这十二个人有西门（耶稣又给他起名叫彼得），还有他兄弟安得烈，又有雅各和约翰，腓力和巴多罗买，
{Luk 6:15}  and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, /al'fAEcs/ and Simon who was called the Zealot, /zelCt/
{Luk 6:15}  马太和多马，亚勒腓的儿子雅各和奋锐党的西门，
{Luk 6:16}  and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. /trAtcr/
{Luk 6:16}  雅各的儿子（或作：兄弟）犹大，和卖主的加略人犹大。
{Luk 6:17}  And he came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast[海岸] of Tyre and Sidon,
{Luk 6:17}  耶稣和他们下了山，站在一块平地上；同站的有许多门徒，又有许多百姓，从犹太全地和耶路撒冷，并推罗、西顿的海边来，都要听他讲道，又指望医治他们的病；
{Luk 6:18}  who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured./kUr/[治疗]
{Luk 6:18}  还有被污鬼缠磨的，也得了医治。
{Luk 6:19}  And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all.
{Luk 6:19}  众人都想要摸他；因为有能力从他身上发出来，医好了他们。
{Luk 6:20}  And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
{Luk 6:20}  耶稣举目看着门徒，说：你们贫穷的人有福了！因为神的国是你们的。
{Luk 6:21}  "Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you shall be satisfied. "Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.
{Luk 6:21}  你们饥饿的人有福了！因为你们将要饱足。你们哀哭的人有福了！因为你们将要喜笑。
{Luk 6:22}  "Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude /eks'klud/[排除] you and revile you and spurn /spcrn/[摒弃] your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man!
{Luk 6:22}  “人为人子恨恶你们，拒绝你们，辱骂你们，弃掉你们的名，以为是恶，你们就有福了！
{Luk 6:23}  Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.
{Luk 6:23}  当那日，你们要欢喜跳跃，因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的。他们的祖宗待先知也是这样。”
{Luk 6:24}  "But woe /wO/[悲哀] to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation. /konsO'lASCn/
{Luk 6:24}  但你们富足的人有祸了！因为你们受过你们的安慰。
{Luk 6:25}  "Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry. "Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn /morn/ and weep.
{Luk 6:25}  你们饱足的人有祸了！因为你们将要饥饿。你们喜笑的人有祸了！因为你们将要哀恸哭泣。
{Luk 6:26}  "Woe to you, when all people speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets.
{Luk 6:26}  “人都说你们好的时候，你们就有祸了！因为他们的祖宗待假先知也是这样。”
{Luk 6:27}  "But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, /enemy/ do good to those who hate you,
{Luk 6:27}  “只是我告诉你们这听道的人，你们的仇敌，要爱他！恨你们的，要待他好！
{Luk 6:28}  bless those who curse /kcrs/[咒诅] you, pray for those who abuse /a'bUs/[凌辱] you.
{Luk 6:28}  咒诅你们的，要为他祝福！凌辱你们的，要为他祷告！
{Luk 6:29}  To one who strikes you on the cheek, /tSEk/[面颊] offer the other also, and from one who takes away your cloak /klOk/ do not withhold [扣留 阻挡] your tunic either.
{Luk 6:29}  有人打你这边的脸，连那边的脸也由他打。有人夺你的外衣，连里衣也由他拿去。
{Luk 6:30}  Give to everyone who begs from you, and from one who takes away your goods do not demand /dE'mxnd/[要求] them back.
{Luk 6:30}  凡求你的，就给他。有人夺你的东西去，不用再要回来。
{Luk 6:31}  And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them.
{Luk 6:31}  你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人。
{Luk 6:32}  "If you love those who love you, what benefit[利益] is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
{Luk 6:32}  你们若单爱那爱你们的人，有什么可酬谢的呢？就是罪人也爱那爱他们的人。
{Luk 6:33}  And if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
{Luk 6:33}  你们若善待那善待你们的人，有什么可酬谢的呢？就是罪人也是这样行。
{Luk 6:34}  And if you lend [借] to those from whom you expect /eks'pekt/[期望] to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to get back the same amount. /a'maunt/
{Luk 6:34}  你们若借给人，指望从他收回，有什么可酬谢的呢？就是罪人也借给罪人，要如数收回。
{Luk 6:35}  But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind [k切分 > 种类 本质 善良] to the ungrateful /Cn'grAtful/ and the evil.
{Luk 6:35}  你们倒要爱仇敌，也要善待他们，并要借给人不指望偿还，你们的赏赐就必大了，你们也必作至高者的儿子；因为他恩待那忘恩的和作恶的。
{Luk 6:36}  Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.
{Luk 6:36}  你们要慈悲，像你们的父慈悲一样。”
{Luk 6:37}  "Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn /kCn'dem/[判刑] not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven;
{Luk 6:37}  “你们不要论断人，就不被论断；你们不要定人的罪，就不被定罪；你们要饶恕人，就必蒙饶恕（饶恕：原文作释放）；
{Luk 6:38}  give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, /meZcr/ pressed down, shaken /SAk/ together, running over, will be put into your lap. /lxp/ For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you."
{Luk 6:38}  你们要给人，就必有给你们的，并且用十足的升斗，连摇带按，上尖下流的倒在你们怀里；因为你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们。”
{Luk 6:39}  He also told them a parable: "Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?
{Luk 6:39}  耶稣又用比喻对他们说：“瞎子岂能领瞎子，两个人不是都要掉在坑里吗？
{Luk 6:40}  A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained [拖长的队伍 > 火车箱 训练队] will be like his teacher.
{Luk 6:40}  学生不能高过先生；凡学成了的不过和先生一样。
{Luk 6:41}  Why do you see the speck [污点] that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
{Luk 6:41}  为什么看见你弟兄眼中有刺，却不想自己眼中有梁木呢？
{Luk 6:42}  How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, /hipOkrit/ first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.
{Luk 6:42}  你不见自己眼中有梁木，怎能对你弟兄说：‘容我去掉你眼中的刺’呢？你这假冒为善的人！先去掉自己眼中的梁木，然后才能看得清楚，去掉你弟兄眼中的刺。”
{Luk 6:43}  "For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit,
{Luk 6:43}  “因为，没有好树结坏果子，也没有坏树结好果子。
{Luk 6:44}  for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor are grapes picked from a bramble /brxmbl/ bush.
{Luk 6:44}  凡树木看果子，就可以认出他来。人不是从荆棘上摘无花果，也不是从蒺藜里摘葡萄。
{Luk 6:45}  The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance /a'bCndans/ of the heart his mouth speaks.
{Luk 6:45}  善人从他心里所存的善就发出善来；恶人从他心里所存的恶就发出恶来；因为心里所充满的，口里就说出来。”
{Luk 6:46}  "Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you?
{Luk 6:46}  “你们为什么称呼我‘主啊，主啊，’却不遵我的话行呢？
{Luk 6:47}  Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like:
{Luk 6:47}  凡到我这里来，听见我的话就去行的，我要告诉你们他像什么人：
{Luk 6:48}  he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood /flCd/ arose, the stream /strEm/[河流 溪流] broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built.
{Luk 6:48}  他像一个人盖房子，深深的挖地，把根基安在磐石上；到发大水的时候，水冲那房子，房子总不能摇动，因为根基立在磐石上（有古卷：因为盖造得好）。
{Luk 6:49}  But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin [毁坏 崩溃] of that house was great."
{Luk 6:49}  惟有听见不去行的，就像一个人在土地上盖房子，没有根基；水一冲，随即倒塌了，并且那房子坏的很大。”
{Luk 7:1}   After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.
{Luk 7:1}   耶稣对百姓讲完了这一切的话，就进了迦百农。
{Luk 7:2}   Now a centurion /sen'tSUriCn/ had a servant who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly valued /vxlU/ by him.
{Luk 7:2}   有一个百夫长所宝贵的仆人害病，快要死了。
{Luk 7:3}   When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders [年长者] of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant.
{Luk 7:3}   百夫长风闻耶稣的事，就托犹太人的几个长老去求耶稣来救他的仆人。
{Luk 7:4}   And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded /plEd/ with [Phr.v向……恳求] him earnestly, /crnest/[近心 > 认真 真诚] saying, "He is worthy to have you do this for him,
{Luk 7:4}   他们到了耶稣那里，就切切的求他说：“你给他行这事是他所配得的；
{Luk 7:5}   for he loves our nation, /nASCn/ and he is the one who built us our synagogue."
{Luk 7:5}   因为他爱我们的百姓，给我们建造会堂。”
{Luk 7:6}   And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from[Phr.prep远离] the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.
{Luk 7:6}   耶稣就和他们同去。离那家不远，百夫长托几个朋友去见耶稣，对他说：“主啊！不要劳动；因你到我舍下，我不敢当。
{Luk 7:7}   Therefore I did not presume /prE'zum/[擅自 假定 冒昧] to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed.
{Luk 7:7}   我也自以为不配去见你，只要你说一句话，我的仆人就必好了。
{Luk 7:8}   For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
{Luk 7:8}   因为我在人的权下，也有兵在我以下，对这个说：‘去！’他就去；对那个说：‘来！’他就来；对我的仆人说：‘你作这事！’他就去做。”
{Luk 7:9}   When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, "I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith."
{Luk 7:9}   耶稣听见这话，就希奇他，转身对跟随的众人说：“我告诉你们，这么大的信心，就是在以色列中，我也没有遇见过。”
{Luk 7:10}  And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.
{Luk 7:10}  那托来的人回到百夫长家里，看见仆人已经好了。
{Luk 7:11}  Soon afterward he went to a town called Nain, /nAn/ and his disciples and a great crowd went with him.
{Luk 7:11}  过了不多时（有古卷：次日），耶稣往一座城去，这城名叫拿因，他的门徒和极多的人与他同行。
{Luk 7:12}  As he drew near [Phr.v接近] to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a considerable /kCn'sidcr/[值得考虑的 相当重大的] crowd from the town was with her.
{Luk 7:12}  将近城门，有一个死人被抬出来。这人是他母亲独生的儿子；他母亲又是寡妇。有城里的许多人同着寡妇送殡。
{Luk 7:13}  And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion /kcm'pxSCn/[一起受苦 > 怜悯] on her and said to her, "Do not weep."
{Luk 7:13}  主看见那寡妇，就怜悯他，对他说：“不要哭！”
{Luk 7:14}  Then he came up and touched the bier, /bEr/[棺材架] and the bearers stood still. And he said, "Young man, I say to you, arise."
{Luk 7:14}  于是进前按着杠，抬的人就站住了。耶稣说：“少年人，我吩咐你，起来！”
{Luk 7:15}  And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.
{Luk 7:15}  那死人就坐起，并且说话。耶稣便把他交给他母亲。
{Luk 7:16}  Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen /a'risen/ among us!" and "God has visited [ < 去看] his people!"
{Luk 7:16}  众人都惊奇，归荣耀与神，说：“有大先知在我们中间兴起来了！”又说：“神眷顾了他的百姓！”
{Luk 7:17}  And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country.
{Luk 7:17}  他这事的风声就传遍了犹太和周围地方。
{Luk 7:18}  The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And John,
{Luk 7:18}  约翰的门徒把这些事都告诉约翰。
{Luk 7:19}  calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?"
{Luk 7:19}  他便叫了两个门徒来，打发他们到主那里去，说：“那将要来的是你吗？还是我们等候别人呢？”
{Luk 7:20}  And when the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?'"
{Luk 7:20}  那两个人来到耶稣那里，说：“施洗的约翰打发我们来问你：‘那将要来的是你吗？还是我们等候别人呢？’”
{Luk 7:21}  In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues /plAg/[灾患] and evil spirits, and on many who were blind he bestowed /bE'stO/[授予 给予] sight.
{Luk 7:21}  正当那时候，耶稣治好了许多有疾病的，受灾患的，被恶鬼附着的，又开恩叫好些瞎子能看见。
{Luk 7:22}  And he answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame /lAm/ walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them.
{Luk 7:22}  耶稣回答说：“你们去，把所看见所听见的事告诉约翰，就是瞎子看见，瘸子行走，长大麻疯的洁净，聋子听见，死人复活，穷人有福音传给他们。
{Luk 7:23}  And blessed is the one who is not offended [过犯] by me."
{Luk 7:23}  凡不因我跌倒的，就有福了！”
{Luk 7:24}  When John's messengers had gone, /gon/ Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed /rEd/[芦苇] shaken by the wind?
{Luk 7:24}  约翰所差来的人既走了，耶稣就对众人讲论约翰说：“你们从前出去到旷野，是要看什么呢？要看风吹动的芦苇吗？
{Luk 7:25}  What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid [辉煌] clothing and live in luxury /lckScry/[奢华] are in kings' courts.
{Luk 7:25}  你们出去，到底是要看什么？要看穿细软衣服的人吗？那穿华丽衣服、宴乐度日的人是在王宫里。
{Luk 7:26}  What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
{Luk 7:26}  你们出去，究竟是要看什么？要看先知吗？我告诉你们，是的，他比先知大多了。
{Luk 7:27}  This is he of whom it is written, "'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
{Luk 7:27}  经上记着说：‘我要差遣我的使者在你前面预备道路’，所说的就是这个人。
{Luk 7:28}  I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
{Luk 7:28}  我告诉你们，凡妇人所生的，没有一个大过约翰的；然而神国里最小的比他还大。”
{Luk 7:29}  (When all the people heard this, and the tax collectors too, they declared God just, having been baptized with the baptism of John,
{Luk 7:29}  众百姓和税吏既受过约翰的洗，听见这话，就以神为义；
{Luk 7:30}  but the Pharisees and the lawyers /loycr/ rejected [拒绝 否绝 < 反跳] the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)
{Luk 7:30}  但法利赛人和律法师没有受过约翰的洗，竟为自己废弃了神的旨意。（29，30两节或作：众百姓和税吏听见了约翰的话，就受了他的洗，便以神为义；但法利赛人和律法师不受约翰的洗，竟为自己废弃了神的旨意。）
{Luk 7:31}  "To what then shall I compare /kCm'pAr/ the people of this generation, and what are they like?
{Luk 7:31}  主又说：“这样，我可用什么比这世代的人呢？他们好像什么呢？
{Luk 7:32}  They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, "'We played the flute /flwt/[笛子] for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, /dcrdZ/ and you did not weep.'
{Luk 7:32}  好像孩童坐在街市上，彼此呼叫说：我们向你们吹笛，你们不跳舞；我们向你们举哀，你们不啼哭。
{Luk 7:33}  For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
{Luk 7:33}  施洗的约翰来，不吃饼，不喝酒，你们说他是被鬼附着的。
{Luk 7:34}  The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look at him! A glutton /glctCn/ and a drunkard, /drCnkard/ a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
{Luk 7:34}  人子来，也吃也喝，你们说他是贪食好酒的人，是税吏和罪人的朋友。
{Luk 7:35}  Yet wisdom is justified by all her children."
{Luk 7:35}  但智慧之子都以智慧为是。”
{Luk 7:36}  One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at table.
{Luk 7:36}  有一个法利赛人请耶稣和他吃饭；耶稣就到法利赛人家里去坐席。
{Luk 7:37}  And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster /xlabxstcr/[雪花石] flask /flxsk/[细颈瓶] of ointment,
{Luk 7:37}  那城里有一个女人，是个罪人，知道耶稣在法利赛人家里坐席，就拿着盛香膏的玉瓶，
{Luk 7:38}  and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.
{Luk 7:38}  站在耶稣背后，挨着他的脚哭，眼泪湿了耶稣的脚，就用自己的头发擦干，又用嘴连连亲他的脚，把香膏抹上。
{Luk 7:39}  Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort [s分开 > 种类] of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner."
{Luk 7:39}  请耶稣的法利赛人看见这事，心里说：“这人若是先知，必知道摸他的是谁，是个怎样的女人，乃是个罪人。”
{Luk 7:40}  And Jesus answering said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." And he answered, "Say it, Teacher."
{Luk 7:40}  耶稣对他说：“西门！我有句话要对你说。”西门说：“夫子，请说。”
{Luk 7:41}  "A certain [确定 特定] moneylender had two debtors. /detcr/ One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
{Luk 7:41}  耶稣说：“一个债主有两个人欠他的债；一个欠五十两银子，一个欠五两银子；
{Luk 7:42}  When they could not pay, he cancelled /kxnsel/ the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?"
{Luk 7:42}  因为他们无力偿还，债主就开恩免了他们两个人的债。这两个人那一个更爱他呢？”
{Luk 7:43}  Simon answered, "The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt." And he said to him, "You have judged rightly."
{Luk 7:43}  西门回答说：“我想是那多得恩免的人。”耶稣说：“你断的不错。”
{Luk 7:44}  Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
{Luk 7:44}  于是转过来向着那女人，便对西门说：“你看见这女人吗？我进了你的家，你没有给我水洗脚；但这女人用眼泪湿了我的脚，用头发擦干。
{Luk 7:45}  You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased /sEs/[s切断 > 停止] to kiss my feet.
{Luk 7:45}  你没有与我亲嘴；但这女人从我进来的时候就不住的用嘴亲我的脚。
{Luk 7:46}  You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.
{Luk 7:46}  你没有用油抹我的头；但这女人用香膏抹我的脚。
{Luk 7:47}  Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little."
{Luk 7:47}  所以我告诉你，他许多的罪都赦免了，因为他的爱多；但那赦免少的，他的爱就少。”
{Luk 7:48}  And he said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
{Luk 7:48}  于是对那女人说：“你的罪赦免了。”
{Luk 7:49}  Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, "Who is this, who even forgives sins?"
{Luk 7:49}  同席的人心里说：“这是什么人，竟赦免人的罪呢？”
{Luk 7:50}  And he said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
{Luk 7:50}  耶稣对那女人说：“你的信救了你；平平安安的回去吧！”
{Luk 8:1}   Soon afterward he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,
{Luk 8:1}   过了不多日，耶稣周游各城各乡传道，宣讲神国的福音。和他同去的有十二个门徒，
{Luk 8:2}   and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, /mxgdalEn/ from whom seven demons had gone out,
{Luk 8:2}   还有被恶鬼所附、被疾病所累、已经治好的几个妇女，内中有称为抹大拉的马利亚（曾有七个鬼从他身上赶出来），
{Luk 8:3}   and Joanna, /dZO'xnna/ the wife of Chuza, /kUza/ Herod's household manager, and Susanna, /su'zxnna/ and many others, who provided /prO'vId/[前看 > 预见 预先准备以便供应] for them out of their means. [m中间、平均、等比 含义 用意 中等 普通 不高级 吝啬 卑鄙][+s 多用意 多技巧 > 手段 方法 生活的手段 > 财物]
{Luk 8:3}   又有希律的家宰苦撒的妻子约亚拿，并苏撒拿，和好些别的妇女，都是用自己的财物供给耶稣和门徒。
{Luk 8:4}   And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable,
{Luk 8:4}   当许多人聚集、又有人从各城里出来见耶稣的时候，耶稣就用比喻说：
{Luk 8:5}   "A sower /sOr/[播种者] went out to sow his seed. /sEd/[碎小细多 > 种子] And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled /trxmpl/ underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured /dE'vaur/[张大嘴拟音 > 吞食] it.
{Luk 8:5}   “有一个撒种的出去撒种。撒的时候，有落在路旁的，被人践踏，天上的飞鸟又来吃尽了。
{Luk 8:6}   And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. /moistScr/[潮湿]
{Luk 8:6}   有落在磐石上的，一出来就枯干了，因为得不着滋润。
{Luk 8:7}   And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked /tSOk/[ch抓住 按住 阻塞 窒息] it.
{Luk 8:7}   有落在荆棘里的，荆棘一同生长，把他挤住了。
{Luk 8:8}   And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded [y伸展 > 生长] a hundredfold." As he said these things, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
{Luk 8:8}   又有落在好土里的，生长起来，结实百倍。”耶稣说了这些话，就大声说：“有耳可听的，就应当听！”
{Luk 8:9}   And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant, /ment/
{Luk 8:9}   门徒问耶稣说：“这比喻是什么意思呢？”
{Luk 8:10}  he said, "To you it has been given to know the secrets [另外分开 > 秘密] of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'
{Luk 8:10}  他说：“神国的奥秘只叫你们知道；至于别人，就用比喻，叫他们看也看不见，听也听不明。”
{Luk 8:11}  Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
{Luk 8:11}  “这比喻乃是这样：种子就是神的道。
{Luk 8:12}  The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
{Luk 8:12}  那些在路旁的，就是人听了道，随后魔鬼来，从他们心里把道夺去，恐怕他们信了得救。
{Luk 8:13}  And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away.
{Luk 8:13}  那些在磐石上的，就是人听道，欢喜领受，但心中没有根，不过暂时相信，及至遇见试炼就退后了。
{Luk 8:14}  And as for [Phr.prep至于] what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature. /ma'tUr/[ma大 > 成熟了]
{Luk 8:14}  那落在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，走开以后，被今生的思虑、钱财、宴乐挤住了，便结不出成熟的子粒来。
{Luk 8:15}  As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest /onest/ and good heart, and bear fruit with patience. /pASens/[p破 ti不伸出 > 忍耐]
{Luk 8:15}  那落在好土里的，就是人听了道，持守在诚实善良的心里，并且忍耐着结实。”
{Luk 8:16}  "No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.
{Luk 8:16}  “没有人点灯用器皿盖上，或放在床底下，乃是放在灯台上，叫进来的人看见亮光。
{Luk 8:17}  For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.
{Luk 8:17}  因为掩藏的事没有不显出来的；隐瞒的事没有不露出来被人知道的。
{Luk 8:18}  Take care then how you hear, for to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away."
{Luk 8:18}  所以，你们应当小心怎样听；因为凡有的，还要加给他；凡没有的，连他自以为有的，也要夺去。”
{Luk 8:19}  Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.
{Luk 8:19}  耶稣的母亲和他弟兄来了，因为人多，不得到他跟前。
{Luk 8:20}  And he was told, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."
{Luk 8:20}  有人告诉他说：“你母亲和你弟兄站在外边，要见你。”
{Luk 8:21}  But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it."
{Luk 8:21}  耶稣回答说：“听了神之道而遵行的人就是我的母亲，我的弟兄了。”
{Luk 8:22}  One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side of the lake." So they set out, [Phr.v出发 < 设定出去]
{Luk 8:22}  有一天，耶稣和门徒上了船，对门徒说：“我们可以渡到湖那边去。”他们就开了船。
{Luk 8:23}  and as they sailed /sAl/[被剪下的一块布 > 帆布 航行] he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger.
{Luk 8:23}  正行的时候，耶稣睡着了。湖上忽然起了暴风，船将满了水，甚是危险。
{Luk 8:24}  And they went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging /rAdZ/[狂暴] waves, /wAv/ and they ceased, /sEs/ and there was a calm. /kam/
{Luk 8:24}  门徒来叫醒了他，说：“夫子！夫子！我们丧命啦！”耶稣醒了，斥责那狂风大浪；风浪就止住，平静了。
{Luk 8:25}  He said to them, "Where is your faith?" And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, "Who then is this, that he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?"
{Luk 8:25}  耶稣对他们说：“你们的信心在那里呢？”他们又惧怕又希奇，彼此说：“这到底是谁？他吩咐风和水，连风和水也听从他了。”
{Luk 8:26}  Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite /opCzit/ Galilee.
{Luk 8:26}  他们到了格拉森（有古卷：加大拉）人的地方，就是加利利的对面。
{Luk 8:27}  When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs. /tum/
{Luk 8:27}  耶稣上了岸，就有城里一个被鬼附着的人迎面而来。这个人许久不穿衣服，不住房子，只住在坟茔里。
{Luk 8:28}  When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment /tor'ment/[受苦] me."
{Luk 8:28}  他见了耶稣，就俯伏在他面前，大声喊叫，说：“至高神的儿子耶稣，我与你有什么相干？求你不要叫我受苦！”
{Luk 8:29}  For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains /tSAn/[ch抓住 > 锁链] and shackles, /Sxkl/[枷锁] but he would break the bonds [结合者] and be driven by the demon into the desert.) /dezcrt/
{Luk 8:29}  是因耶稣曾吩咐污鬼从那人身上出来。原来这鬼屡次抓住他；他常被人看守，又被铁链和脚镣捆锁，他竟把锁链挣断，被鬼赶到旷野去。
{Luk 8:30}  Jesus then asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Legion," /lEdZiCn/ for many demons had entered him.
{Luk 8:30}  耶稣问他说：“你名叫什么？”他说：“我名叫‘群’”；这是因为附着他的鬼多。
{Luk 8:31}  And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. /a'bis/
{Luk 8:31}  鬼就央求耶稣，不要吩咐他们到无底坑里去。
{Luk 8:32}  Now a large herd /hcrd/ of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. /pcr'miSCn/
{Luk 8:32}  那里有一大群猪在山上吃食。鬼央求耶稣，准他们进入猪里去。耶稣准了他们，
{Luk 8:33}  Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep /stEp/[陡峭] bank into the lake and drowned. /draun/[淹没]
{Luk 8:33}  鬼就从那人出来，进入猪里去。于是那群猪闯下山崖，投在湖里淹死了。
{Luk 8:34}  When the herdsmen /hcrdsmen/ saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.
{Luk 8:34}  放猪的看见这事就逃跑了，去告诉城里和乡下的人。
{Luk 8:35}  Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.
{Luk 8:35}  众人出来要看是什么事；到了耶稣那里，看见鬼所离开的那人，坐在耶稣脚前，穿着衣服，心里明白过来，他们就害怕。
{Luk 8:36}  And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.
{Luk 8:36}  看见这事的便将被鬼附着的人怎么得救告诉他们。
{Luk 8:37}  Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.
{Luk 8:37}  格拉森四围的人，因为害怕得很，都求耶稣离开他们；耶稣就上船回去了。
{Luk 8:38}  The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
{Luk 8:38}  鬼所离开的那人恳求和耶稣同在；耶稣却打发他回去，说：
{Luk 8:39}  "Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you." And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.
{Luk 8:39}  “你回家去，传说神为你作了何等大的事。”他就去，满城里传扬耶稣为他做了何等大的事。
{Luk 8:40}  Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
{Luk 8:40}  耶稣回来的时候，众人迎接他，因为他们都等候他。
{Luk 8:41}  And there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus' feet, he implored /im'plor/[哀求] him to come to his house,
{Luk 8:41}  有一个管会堂的，名叫睚鲁，来俯伏在耶稣脚前，求耶稣到他家里去；
{Luk 8:42}  for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. As Jesus went, the people pressed around him.
{Luk 8:42}  因他有一个独生女儿，约有十二岁，快要死了。耶稣去的时候，众人拥挤他。
{Luk 8:43}  And there was a woman who had had a discharge /dis'tSardZ/[卸下] of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her living on physicians, she could not be healed by anyone.
{Luk 8:43}  有一个女人，患了十二年的血漏，在医生手里花尽了他一切养生的，并没有一人能医好他。
{Luk 8:44}  She came up behind him and touched the fringe /frindZ/ of his garment, and immediately her discharge of blood ceased.
{Luk 8:44}  他来到耶稣背后，摸他的衣裳䍁子，血漏立刻就止住了。
{Luk 8:45}  And Jesus said, "Who was it that touched me?" When all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!"
{Luk 8:45}  耶稣说：“摸我的是谁？”众人都不承认。彼得和同行的人都说：“夫子，众人拥拥挤挤紧靠着你。（有古卷加：你还问摸我的是谁吗？）”
{Luk 8:46}  But Jesus said, "Someone touched me, for I perceive /pcr'sEv/[察觉] that power has gone out from me."
{Luk 8:46}  耶稣说：“总有人摸我，因我觉得有能力从我身上出去。”
{Luk 8:47}  And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, /trembl/[颤抖] and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.
{Luk 8:47}  那女人知道不能隐藏，就战战兢兢的来俯伏在耶稣脚前，把摸他的缘故和怎样立刻得好了，当着众人都说出来。
{Luk 8:48}  And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace."
{Luk 8:48}  耶稣对他说：“女儿，你的信救了你；平平安安的去吧！”
{Luk 8:49}  While he was still speaking, someone from the ruler's house came and said, "Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more." [Phr.adv再]
{Luk 8:49}  还说话的时候，有人从管会堂的家里来，说：“你的女儿死了，不要劳动夫子。”
{Luk 8:50}  But Jesus on hearing this answered him, "Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well."
{Luk 8:50}  耶稣听见就对他说：“不要怕，只要信！你的女儿就必得救。”
{Luk 8:51}  And when he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child.
{Luk 8:51}  耶稣到了他的家，除了彼得、约翰、雅各，和女儿的父母，不许别人同他进去。
{Luk 8:52}  And all were weeping and mourning for her, but he said, "Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping."
{Luk 8:52}  众人都为这女儿哀哭捶胸。耶稣说：“不要哭！他不是死了，是睡着了。”
{Luk 8:53}  And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
{Luk 8:53}  他们晓得女儿已经死了，就嗤笑耶稣。
{Luk 8:54}  But taking her by the hand he called, saying, "Child, arise."
{Luk 8:54}  耶稣拉着他的手，呼叫说：“女儿，起来吧！”
{Luk 8:55}  And her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed /di'rekt/[指示] that something should be given her to eat.
{Luk 8:55}  他的灵魂便回来，他就立刻起来了。耶稣吩咐给他东西吃。
{Luk 8:56}  And her parents /pArent/[父母 < 一对匹配] were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.
{Luk 8:56}  他的父母惊奇得很；耶稣嘱咐他们，不要把所做的事告诉人。
{Luk 9:1}   And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases,
{Luk 9:1}   耶稣叫齐了十二个门徒，给他们能力、权柄，制伏一切的鬼，医治各样的病，
{Luk 9:2}   and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal.
{Luk 9:2}   又差遣他们去宣传神国的道，医治病人，
{Luk 9:3}   And he said to them, "Take nothing for your journey, /dZcrnE/ no staff, /stxf/[拐杖 < 协助站立] nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.
{Luk 9:3}   对他们说：“行路的时候，不要带拐杖和口袋，不要带食物和银子，也不要带两件褂子。
{Luk 9:4}   And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.
{Luk 9:4}   无论进哪一家，就住在那里，也从那里起行。
{Luk 9:5}   And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them."
{Luk 9:5}   凡不接待你们的，你们离开那城的时候，要把脚上的尘土跺下去，见证他们的不是。”
{Luk 9:6}   And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere. [各处 到处]
{Luk 9:6}   门徒就出去，走遍各乡宣传福音，到处治病。
{Luk 9:7}   Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, /pcr'pleks/[per全都 x交织 < 困惑 不知所措] because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,
{Luk 9:7}   分封的王希律听见耶稣所做的一切事，就游移不定；因为有人说：“是约翰从死里复活；”
{Luk 9:8}   by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen.
{Luk 9:8}   又有人说：“是以利亚显现；”还有人说：“是古时的一个先知又活了。”
{Luk 9:9}   Herod said, "John I beheaded, /bE'hed/[头的位置 > 砍头] but who is this about whom I hear such things?" And he sought to see him.
{Luk 9:9}   希律说：“约翰我已经斩了，这却是什么人？我竟听见他这样的事呢？”就想要见他。
{Luk 9:10}  On their return the apostles told him all that they had done. And he took them and withdrew [撤回] apart to a town called Bethsaida.
{Luk 9:10}  使徒回来，将所做的事告诉耶稣，耶稣就带他们暗暗的离开那里，往一座城去；那城名叫伯赛大。
{Luk 9:11}  When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing.
{Luk 9:11}  但众人知道了，就跟着他去；耶稣便接待他们，对他们讲论神国的道，医治那些需医的人。
{Luk 9:12}  Now the day began to wear away, [Phr.v消逝 磨损 < 穿旧了] and the twelve came and said to him, "Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging /lodZ/[寄宿处] and get provisions, /prO'viZiCn/[食品供应] for we are here in a desolate place."
{Luk 9:12}  日头快要平西，十二个门徒来对他说：“请叫众人散开，他们好往四面乡村里去借宿找吃的，因为我们这里是野地。”
{Luk 9:13}  But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves /lOf/ and two fish—unless we are to go and buy food for all these people."
{Luk 9:13}  耶稣说：“你们给他们吃吧！”门徒说：“我们不过有五个饼，两条鱼，若不去为这许多人买食物就不够。”
{Luk 9:14}  For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups [Phr.prep成组] of about fifty each."
{Luk 9:14}  那时，人数约有五千。耶稣对门徒说：“叫他们一排一排的坐下，每排大约五十个人。”
{Luk 9:15}  And they did so, and had them all sit down.
{Luk 9:15}  门徒就如此行，叫众人都坐下。
{Luk 9:16}  And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
{Luk 9:16}  耶稣拿着这五个饼，两条鱼，望着天祝福，擘开，递给门徒，摆在众人面前。
{Luk 9:17}  And they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of broken pieces.
{Luk 9:17}  他们就吃，并且都吃饱了；把剩下的零碎收拾起来，装满了十二篮子。
{Luk 9:18}  Now it happened that as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"
{Luk 9:18}  耶稣自己祷告的时候，门徒也同他在那里。耶稣问他们说：“众人说我是谁？”
{Luk 9:19}  And they answered, "John the Baptist. But others say, Elijah, and others, that one of the prophets of old has risen."
{Luk 9:19}  他们说：“有人说是施洗的约翰；有人说是以利亚；还有人说是古时的一个先知又活了。”
{Luk 9:20}  Then he said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" And Peter answered, "The Christ of God."
{Luk 9:20}  耶稣说：“你们说我是谁？”彼得回答说：“是神所立的基督。”
{Luk 9:21}  And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,
{Luk 9:21}  耶稣切切的嘱咐他们，不可将这事告诉人，
{Luk 9:22}  saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected /rE'dZekt/[反向投 > 弃绝] by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised."
{Luk 9:22}  又说：“人子必须受许多的苦，被长老、祭司长、和文士弃绝，并且被杀，第三日复活。”
{Luk 9:23}  And he said to all, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily /dAly/ and follow me.
{Luk 9:23}  耶稣又对众人说：“若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，天天背起他的十字架来跟从我。
{Luk 9:24}  For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
{Luk 9:24}  因为，凡要救自己生命（生命：或作灵魂；下同）的，必丧掉生命；凡为我丧掉生命的，必救了生命。
{Luk 9:25}  For what does it profit [pro前 f面向 > 前进 > 利于 益于] a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits /forfit/[丧失] himself?
{Luk 9:25}  人若赚得全世界，却丧了自己，赔上自己，有什么益处呢？
{Luk 9:26}  For whoever is ashamed /a'SAmd/ of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
{Luk 9:26}  凡把我和我的道当作可耻的，人子在自己的荣耀里，并天父与圣天使的荣耀里降临的时候，也要把那人当作可耻的。
{Luk 9:27}  But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God."
{Luk 9:27}  我实在告诉你们，站在这里的，有人在没尝死味以前，必看见神的国。”
{Luk 9:28}  Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.
{Luk 9:28}  说了这话以后约有八天，耶稣带着彼得、约翰、雅各上山去祷告。
{Luk 9:29}  And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, /altcr/[变更 < 别的] and his clothing became dazzling /dxzl/ white.
{Luk 9:29}  正祷告的时候，他的面貌就改变了，衣服洁白放光。
{Luk 9:30}  And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah,
{Luk 9:30}  忽然有摩西、以利亚两个人同耶稣说话；
{Luk 9:31}  who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, /dE'partScr/[离开 离世] which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
{Luk 9:31}  他们在荣光里显现，谈论耶稣去世的事，就是他在耶路撒冷将要成的事。
{Luk 9:32}  Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy /hevy/ with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.
{Luk 9:32}  彼得和他的同伴都打盹，既清醒了，就看见耶稣的荣光，并同他站着的那两个人。
{Luk 9:33}  And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, [伸出 > 帐篷] one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah"—not knowing what he said.
{Luk 9:33}  二人正要和耶稣分离的时候，彼得对耶稣说：“夫子，我们在这里真好！可以搭三座棚，一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。”他却不知道所说的是什么。
{Luk 9:34}  As he was saying these things, a cloud /klaud/ came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
{Luk 9:34}  说这话的时候，有一朵云彩来遮盖他们；他们进入云彩里就惧怕。
{Luk 9:35}  And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, my Chosen /tSOzen/ One; listen to him!"
{Luk 9:35}  有声音从云彩里出来，说：“这是我的儿子，我所拣选的（有古卷：这是我的爱子），你们要听他。”
{Luk 9:36}  And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent /sIlent/ and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.
{Luk 9:36}  声音住了，只见耶稣一人在那里。当那些日子，门徒不提所看见的事，一样也不告诉人。
{Luk 9:37}  On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.
{Luk 9:37}  第二天，他们下了山，就有许多人迎见耶稣。
{Luk 9:38}  And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
{Luk 9:38}  其中有一人喊叫说：“夫子！求你看顾我的儿子，因为他是我的独生子。
{Luk 9:39}  And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly /sCdenly/ cries out. It convulses /kCn'vcls/[震动 抽搐] him so that he foams /fOm/[泡沫] at the mouth, and shatters /Sxttcr/[打碎] him, and will hardly [很难] leave him.
{Luk 9:39}  他被鬼抓住就忽然喊叫；鬼又叫他抽疯，口中流沫，并且重重的伤害他，难以离开他。
{Luk 9:40}  And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."
{Luk 9:40}  我求过你的门徒，把鬼赶出去，他们却是不能。”
{Luk 9:41}  Jesus answered, "O faithless and twisted [扭曲] generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with [Phr.v忍受] you? Bring your son here."
{Luk 9:41}  耶稣说：“嗳！这又不信又悖谬的世代啊，我在你们这里，忍耐你们要到几时呢？将你的儿子带到这里来吧！”
{Luk 9:42}  While he was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
{Luk 9:42}  正来的时候，鬼把他摔倒，叫他重重的抽疯。耶稣就斥责那污鬼，把孩子治好了，交给他父亲。
{Luk 9:43}  And all were astonished at the majesty /mxdZesty/[王权 < ma大 > 陛下] of God. But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples,
{Luk 9:43}  众人都诧异神的大能（大能：或作威荣）。耶稣所做的一切事，众人正希奇的时候，耶稣对门徒说：
{Luk 9:44}  "Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."
{Luk 9:44}  “你们要把这些话存在耳中，因为人子将要被交在人手里。”
{Luk 9:45}  But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed /kCn'sEl/[隐蔽] from them, so that they might not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
{Luk 9:45}  他们不明白这话，意思乃是隐藏的，叫他们不能明白，他们也不敢问这话的意思。
{Luk 9:46}  An argument /argUment/ arose among them as to [Phr.prep至于] which of them was the greatest.
{Luk 9:46}  门徒中间起了议论，谁将为大。
{Luk 9:47}  But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side
{Luk 9:47}  耶稣看出他们心中的议论，就领一个小孩子来，叫他站在自己旁边，
{Luk 9:48}  and said to them, "Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least /lEst/ among you all is the one who is great."
{Luk 9:48}  对他们说：“凡为我名接待这小孩子的，就是接待我；凡接待我的，就是接待那差我来的。你们中间最小的，他便为大。”
{Luk 9:49}  John answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us."
{Luk 9:49}  约翰说：“夫子，我们看见一个人奉你的名赶鬼，我们就禁止他，因为他不与我们一同跟从你。”
{Luk 9:50}  But Jesus said to him, "Do not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you."
{Luk 9:50}  耶稣说：“不要禁止他；因为不敌挡你们的，就是帮助你们的。”
{Luk 9:51}  When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.
{Luk 9:51}  耶稣被接上升的日子将到，他就定意向耶路撒冷去，
{Luk 9:52}  And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, /sa'mxritan/ to make preparations /prepa'rAtSCn/ for him.
{Luk 9:52}  便打发使者在他前头走。他们到了撒玛利亚的一个村庄，要为他预备。
{Luk 9:53}  But the people did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem.
{Luk 9:53}  那里的人不接待他，因他面向耶路撒冷去。
{Luk 9:54}  And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, "Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume /kCn'sum/[用尽 > 消灭 毁灭] them?"
{Luk 9:54}  他的门徒雅各、约翰看见了，就说：“主啊，你要我们吩咐火从天上降下来烧灭他们，像以利亚所做的（有古卷没有像以利亚所做的这几个字）吗？”
{Luk 9:55}  But he turned and rebuked them.
{Luk 9:55}  耶稣转身责备两个门徒，说：“你们的心如何，你们并不知道。
{Luk 9:56}  And they went on to another village.
{Luk 9:56}  人子来不是要灭人的性命（“性命”或作“灵魂”。下同），是要救人的性命。”说着就往别的村庄去了（有古卷只有五十五节首句，五十六节末句）。
{Luk 9:57}  As they were going along the road, someone said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
{Luk 9:57}  他们走路的时候，有一人对耶稣说：“你无论往那里去，我要跟从你。”
{Luk 9:58}  And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, [n小 st站点 > 小家 窝] but the Son of Man has nowhere [没有地方] to lay his head."
{Luk 9:58}  耶稣说：“狐狸有洞，天空的飞鸟有窝，只是人子没有枕头的地方。”
{Luk 9:59}  To another he said, "Follow me." But he said, "Lord, let me first go and bury /bery/ < /bUry/ my father."
{Luk 9:59}  又对一个人说：“跟从我来！”那人说：“主，容我先回去埋葬我的父亲。”
{Luk 9:60}  And Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God."
{Luk 9:60}  耶稣说：“任凭死人埋葬他们的死人，你只管去传扬神国的道。”
{Luk 9:61}  Yet another said, "I will follow you, Lord, but let me first say farewell /fAr'wel/[f向前 well > 走好 再会 辞别] to those at my home."
{Luk 9:61}  又有一人说：“主，我要跟从你，但容我先去辞别我家里的人。”
{Luk 9:62}  Jesus said to him, "No one who puts his hand to the plow /plau/ and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."
{Luk 9:62}  耶稣说：“手扶着犁向后看的，不配进神的国。”
{Luk 10:1}  After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go.
{Luk 10:1}  这事以后，主又设立七十个人，差遣他们两个两个的在他前面，往自己所要到的各城各地方去，
{Luk 10:2}  And he said to them, "The harvest [收获] is plentiful, but the laborers /lAbcrcr/ are few. /fU/ Therefore pray /prA/ earnestly /crnest/[认真 真诚 < 接近心] to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
{Luk 10:2}  就对他们说：“要收的庄稼多，作工的人少。所以，你们当求庄稼的主打发工人出去收他的庄稼。
{Luk 10:3}  Go your way; behold, I am sending you out as lambs /lxm/ in the midst of wolves. /wulf/
{Luk 10:3}  你们去吧！我差你们出去，如同羊羔进入狼群。
{Luk 10:4}  Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, /nxpsxk/[背包] no sandals, and greet /grEt/[问安 < 靠近] no one on the road.
{Luk 10:4}  不要带钱囊，不要带口袋，不要带鞋；在路上也不要问人的安。
{Luk 10:5}  Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house!'
{Luk 10:5}  无论进哪一家，先要说：‘愿这一家平安。’
{Luk 10:6}  And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, it will return to you.
{Luk 10:6}  那里若有当得平安的人（当得平安的人：原文作平安之子），你们所求的平安就必临到那家；不然，就归与你们了。
{Luk 10:7}  And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer deserves /dE'zcrv/[应受赏 < 勤勉服务] his wages. /wAdZ/[工资] Do not go from house to house.
{Luk 10:7}  你们要住在那家，吃喝他们所供给的，因为工人得工价是应当的；不要从这家搬到那家。
{Luk 10:8}  Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you.
{Luk 10:8}  无论进哪一城，人若接待你们，给你们摆上什么，你们就吃什么。
{Luk 10:9}  Heal the sick in it and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'
{Luk 10:9}  要医治那城里的病人，对他们说：‘神的国临近你们了。’
{Luk 10:10} But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say,
{Luk 10:10} 无论进哪一城，人若不接待你们，你们就到街上去，
{Luk 10:11} 'Even the dust of your town that clings /kliN/[cl抓住 > 粘紧] to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.'
{Luk 10:11} 说：‘就是你们城里的尘土黏在我们的脚上，我们也当着你们擦去。虽然如此，你们该知道神的国临近了。’
{Luk 10:12} I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom /sodCm/ than for that town.
{Luk 10:12} 我告诉你们，当审判的日子，所多玛所受的，比那城还容易受呢！”
{Luk 10:13} "Woe to you, Chorazin! /korazin/ Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, [Phr.adv很久以前] sitting in sackcloth /sxk,kloth/ and ashes. /xS/
{Luk 10:13} “哥拉汛哪，你有祸了！伯赛大啊，你有祸了！因为在你们中间所行的异能若行在推罗、西顿，他们早已披麻蒙灰，坐在地上悔改了。
{Luk 10:14} But it will be more bearable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
{Luk 10:14} 当审判的日子，推罗、西顿所受的，比你们还容易受呢！
{Luk 10:15} And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted /eg'zalt/[向上提出 > 提升] to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades. /hAdEs/
{Luk 10:15} 迦百农啊，你已经升到天上（或作：你将要升到天上吗），将来必推下阴间。”
{Luk 10:16} "The one who hears you hears me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects him who sent me."
{Luk 10:16} 又对门徒说：“听从你们的就是听从我；弃绝你们的就是弃绝我；弃绝我的就是弃绝那差我来的。”
{Luk 10:17} The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject /sCb'dZekt/[sub下 ject弹出 > 下面来 > 隶属 屈从 主题] to us in your name!"
{Luk 10:17} 那七十个人欢欢喜喜的回来，说：“主啊！因你的名，就是鬼也服了我们。”
{Luk 10:18} And he said to them, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
{Luk 10:18} 耶稣对他们说：“我曾看见撒但从天上坠落，像闪电一样。
{Luk 10:19} Behold, I have given you authority to tread /tred/[踩踏 < 走 跑 踏] on serpents and scorpions, /skorpiCn/[蝎子] and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.
{Luk 10:19} 我已经给你们权柄可以践踏蛇和蝎子，又胜过仇敌一切的能力，断没有什么能害你们。
{Luk 10:20} Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."
{Luk 10:20} 然而，不要因鬼服了你们就欢喜，要因你们的名记录在天上欢喜。”
{Luk 10:21} In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious /grASCs/ will.
{Luk 10:21} 正当那时，耶稣被圣灵感动就欢乐，说：“父啊，天地的主，我感谢你！因为你将这些事向聪明通达人就藏起来，向婴孩就显出来。父啊！是的，因为你的美意本是如此。
{Luk 10:22} All things have been handed over [Phr.v交上] to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
{Luk 10:22} 一切所有的都是我父交付我的；除了父，没有人知道子是谁；除了子和子所愿意指示的，没有人知道父是谁。”
{Luk 10:23} Then turning to the disciples he said privately, /prIvAt/[priv破开 隔开 > 私有] "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!
{Luk 10:23} 耶稣转身暗暗的对门徒说：“看见你们所看见的，那眼睛就有福了。
{Luk 10:24} For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it."
{Luk 10:24} 我告诉你们，从前有许多先知和君王要看你们所看的，却没有看见，要听你们所听的，却没有听见。”
{Luk 10:25} And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
{Luk 10:25} 有一个律法师起来试探耶稣，说：“夫子！我该做什么才可以承受永生？”
{Luk 10:26} He said to him, "What is written in the Law? How do you read it?"
{Luk 10:26} 耶稣对他说：“律法上写的是什么？你念的是怎样呢？”
{Luk 10:27} And he answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength [力量] and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself."
{Luk 10:27} 他回答说：“你要尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱主你的神；又要爱邻舍如同自己。”
{Luk 10:28} And he said to him, "You have answered correctly; /kcr'rekt/[弄直 > 正确恰当] do this, and you will live."
{Luk 10:28} 耶稣说：“你回答的是；你这样行，就必得永生。”
{Luk 10:29} But he, desiring to justify [证明合法] himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
{Luk 10:29} 那人要显明自己有理，就对耶稣说：“谁是我的邻舍呢？”
{Luk 10:30} Jesus replied, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, /dZerikO/ and he fell among robbers, who stripped [剥夺] him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead.
{Luk 10:30} 耶稣回答说：“有一个人从耶路撒冷下耶利哥去，落在强盗手中。他们剥去他的衣裳，把他打个半死，就丢下他走了。
{Luk 10:31} Now by chance [机会 偶然 < 抓住] [Phr.prep偶然] a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.
{Luk 10:31} 偶然有一个祭司从这条路下来，看见他就从那边过去了。
{Luk 10:32} So likewise a Levite, /lEvIt/ when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
{Luk 10:32} 又有一个利未人来到这地方，看见他，也照样从那边过去了。
{Luk 10:33} But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. /kcm'pxSCn/
{Luk 10:33} 惟有一个撒玛利亚人行路来到那里，看见他就动了慈心，
{Luk 10:34} He went to him and bound /baund/ up his wounds, /wund/ pouring [倒] on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
{Luk 10:34} 上前用油和酒倒在他的伤处，包裹好了，扶他骑上自己的牲口，带到店里去照应他。
{Luk 10:35} And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, [花费 < p破出] I will repay /rE'pA/[偿还 < 反向付] you when I come back.'
{Luk 10:35} 第二天拿出二钱银子来，交给店主，说：‘你且照应他；此外所费用的，我回来必还你。’
{Luk 10:36} Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?"
{Luk 10:36} 你想，这三个人那一个是落在强盗手中的邻舍呢？”
{Luk 10:37} He said, "The one who showed him mercy." And Jesus said to him, "You go, and do likewise."
{Luk 10:37} 他说：“是怜悯他的。”耶稣说：“你去照样行吧。”
{Luk 10:38} Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village. And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house.
{Luk 10:38} 他们走路的时候，耶稣进了一个村庄。有一个女人，名叫马大，接他到自己家里。
{Luk 10:39} And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching.
{Luk 10:39} 他有一个妹子，名叫马利亚，在耶稣脚前坐着听他的道。
{Luk 10:40} But Martha was distracted /di'strxkt/[强调伸出 > 转移 分散 分心] with much serving. And she went up to him and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me."
{Luk 10:40} 马大伺候的事多，心里忙乱，就进前来，说：“主啊，我的妹子留下我一个人伺候，你不在意吗？请吩咐他来帮助我。”
{Luk 10:41} But the Lord answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious /xnkScs/[x交织 > 不安 忧虑] and troubled about many things,
{Luk 10:41} 耶稣回答说：“马大！马大！你为许多的事思虑烦扰，
{Luk 10:42} but one thing is necessary. /nesesxry/[n接近 > 必需] Mary has chosen /tSOsen/ the good portion, /porSCn/[部分] which will not be taken away from her."
{Luk 10:42} 但是不可少的只有一件；马利亚已经选择那上好的福分，是不能夺去的。”
{Luk 11:1}  Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples."
{Luk 11:1}  耶稣在一个地方祷告；祷告完了，有个门徒对他说：“求主教导我们祷告，像约翰教导他的门徒。”
{Luk 11:2}  And he said to them, "When you pray, say: "Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come.
{Luk 11:2}  耶稣说：“你们祷告的时候，要说：我们在天上的父（有古卷：父啊）：愿人都尊你的名为圣。愿你的国降临；愿你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上（有古卷没有愿你的旨意云云）。
{Luk 11:3}  Give us each day our daily bread,
{Luk 11:3}  我们日用的饮食，天天赐给我们。
{Luk 11:4}  and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted /in'det/[负债] to us. And lead us not into temptation."
{Luk 11:4}  赦免我们的罪，因为我们也赦免凡亏欠我们的人。不叫我们遇见试探；救我们脱离凶恶（有古卷没有末句）。”
{Luk 11:5}  And he said to them, "Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight /midnIt/ and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves,
{Luk 11:5}  耶稣又说：“你们中间谁有一个朋友半夜到他那里去，说：‘朋友！请借给我三个饼；
{Luk 11:6}  for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him';
{Luk 11:6}  因为我有一个朋友行路，来到我这里，我没有什么给他摆上。’
{Luk 11:7}  and he will answer from within, 'Do not bother /bodhcr/[搅扰] me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything'?
{Luk 11:7}  那人在里面回答说：‘不要搅扰我，门已经关闭，孩子们也同我在床上了，我不能起来给你。’
{Luk 11:8}  I tell you, though /dhO/ he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence /impUdens/[厚脸皮] he will rise and give him whatever he needs.
{Luk 11:8}  我告诉你们，虽不因他是朋友起来给他，但因他情词迫切的直求，就必起来照他所需用的给他。
{Luk 11:9}  And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
{Luk 11:9}  我又告诉你们，你们祈求，就给你们；寻找，就寻见；叩门，就给你们开门。
{Luk 11:10} For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.
{Luk 11:10} 因为，凡祈求的，就得着；寻找的，就寻见；叩门的，就给他开门。
{Luk 11:11} What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent;
{Luk 11:11} 你们中间作父亲的，谁有儿子求饼，反给他石头呢？求鱼，反拿蛇当鱼给他呢？
{Luk 11:12} or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
{Luk 11:12} 求鸡蛋，反给他蝎子呢？
{Luk 11:13} If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"
{Luk 11:13} 你们虽然不好，尚且知道拿好东西给儿女；何况天父，岂不更将圣灵给求他的人吗？”
{Luk 11:14} Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. /mUt/ When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the people marveled.
{Luk 11:14} 耶稣赶出一个叫人哑巴的鬼，鬼出去了，哑巴就说出话来；众人都希奇。
{Luk 11:15} But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, /bE'elzbul/ the prince /prins/[pri顶尖 > 王子] of demons,"
{Luk 11:15} 内中却有人说：“他是靠着鬼王别西卜赶鬼。”
{Luk 11:16} while others, to test him, kept seeking from him a sign from heaven.
{Luk 11:16} 又有人试探耶稣，向他求从天上来的神迹。
{Luk 11:17} But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided /di'vId/ against itself is laid [l拉长 > 铺设 地形] waste, /wAst/[废物] [Phr.v荒芜] and a divided household falls.
{Luk 11:17} 他晓得他们的意念，便对他们说：“凡一国自相分争，就成为荒场；凡一家自相分争，就必败落。
{Luk 11:18} And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
{Luk 11:18} 若撒但自相分争，他的国怎能站得住呢？因为你们说我是靠着别西卜赶鬼。
{Luk 11:19} And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
{Luk 11:19} 我若靠着别西卜赶鬼，你们的子弟赶鬼又靠着谁呢？这样，他们就要断定你们的是非。
{Luk 11:20} But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
{Luk 11:20} 我若靠着神的能力赶鬼，这就是神的国临到你们了。
{Luk 11:21} When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, /pxlas/[豪华住宅] his goods are safe;
{Luk 11:21} 壮士披挂整齐，看守自己的住宅，他所有的都平安无事；
{Luk 11:22} but when one stronger than he attacks /a'txk/ him and overcomes him, he takes away his armor /armcr/[盔甲] in which he trusted and divides his spoil. [战利品 < 剥离]
{Luk 11:22} 但有一个比他更壮的来，胜过他，就夺去他所倚靠的盔甲兵器，又分了他的赃。
{Luk 11:23} Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. /skxtcr/
{Luk 11:23} 不与我相合的，就是敌我的；不同我收聚的，就是分散的。”
{Luk 11:24} "When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and finding none it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.'
{Luk 11:24} “污鬼离了人身，就在无水之地过来过去，寻求安歇之处；既寻不着，便说：‘我要回到我所出来的屋里去。’
{Luk 11:25} And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order.
{Luk 11:25} 到了，就看见里面打扫干净，修饰好了，
{Luk 11:26} Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state /stAt/[st站立 > 状态] of that person is worse than the first."
{Luk 11:26} 便去另带了七个比自己更恶的鬼来，都进去住在那里。那人末后的景况比先前更不好了。”
{Luk 11:27} As he said these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts /brest/ at which you nursed!"/ncrs/
{Luk 11:27} 耶稣正说这话的时候，众人中间有一个女人大声说：“怀你胎的和乳养你的有福了！”
{Luk 11:28} But he said, "Blessed rather /rxdhcr/ are those who hear the word of God and keep it!"
{Luk 11:28} 耶稣说：“是，却还不如听神之道而遵守的人有福。”
{Luk 11:29} When the crowds were increasing, /in'krEs/[增加 繁殖] he began to say, "This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. /dZOna/
{Luk 11:29} 当众人聚集的时候，耶稣开讲说：“这世代是一个邪恶的世代。他们求看神迹，除了约拿的神迹以外，再没有神迹给他们看。
{Luk 11:30} For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.
{Luk 11:30} 约拿怎样为尼尼微人成了神迹，人子也要照样为这世代的人成了神迹。
{Luk 11:31} The queen /kwEn/ of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
{Luk 11:31} 当审判的时候，南方的女王要起来定这世代的罪；因为他从地极而来，要听所罗门的智慧话。看哪！在这里有一人比所罗门更大。
{Luk 11:32} The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
{Luk 11:32} 当审判的时候，尼尼微人要起来定这世代的罪，因为尼尼微人听了约拿所传的就悔改了。看哪！在这里有一人比约拿更大。”
{Luk 11:33} "No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar /selar/ or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.
{Luk 11:33} “没有人点灯放在地窨子里，或是斗底下，总是放在灯台上，使进来的人看得见亮光。
{Luk 11:34} Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness.
{Luk 11:34} 你眼睛就是身上的灯。你的眼睛若了亮，全身就光明；眼睛若昏花，全身就黑暗。
{Luk 11:35} Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness.
{Luk 11:35} 所以，你要省察，恐怕你里头的光或者黑暗了。
{Luk 11:36} If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its rays /rA/ gives you light."
{Luk 11:36} 若是你全身光明，毫无黑暗，就必全然光明，如同灯的明光照亮你。”
{Luk 11:37} While Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine /dIn/ with him, so he went in and reclined at table.
{Luk 11:37} 说话的时候，有一个法利赛人请耶稣同他吃饭，耶稣就进去坐席。
{Luk 11:38} The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner.
{Luk 11:38} 这法利赛人看见耶稣饭前不洗手便诧异。
{Luk 11:39} And the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed /grEd/[贪心 < 逐级动] and wickedness.
{Luk 11:39} 主对他说：“如今你们法利赛人洗净杯盘的外面，你们里面却满了勒索和邪恶。
{Luk 11:40} You fools! /fwl/[f风箱 > 脑袋空空 傻瓜] Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?
{Luk 11:40} 无知的人哪，造外面的，不也造里面吗？
{Luk 11:41} But give as alms [施舍品] those things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you.
{Luk 11:41} 只要把里面的施舍给人，凡物于你们就都洁净了。
{Luk 11:42} "But woe /wO/ to you Pharisees! For you tithe /tIdh/[ti=ten十 十分之一] mint and rue /rw/ and every herb, /hcrb/[香药草] and neglect /nE'glekt/[忽略 < no没 lect选出来] justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
{Luk 11:42} “你们法利赛人有祸了！因为你们将薄荷、芸香并各样菜蔬献上十分之一，那公义和爱神的事反倒不行了。这原是你们当行的；那也是不可不行的。
{Luk 11:43} Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.
{Luk 11:43} 你们法利赛人有祸了！因为你们喜爱会堂里的首位，又喜爱人在街市上问你们的安。
{Luk 11:44} Woe to you! For you are like unmarked /Cn'mark/ graves, /grAv/[坟墓 雕刻 < 挖掘] and people walk over them without knowing it."
{Luk 11:44} 你们有祸了！因为你们如同不显露的坟墓，走在上面的人并不知道。”
{Luk 11:45} One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying these things you insult /in'sclt/[侮辱] us also."
{Luk 11:45} 律法师中有一个回答耶稣说：“夫子！你这样说也把我们糟蹋了。”
{Luk 11:46} And he said, "Woe to you lawyers also! For you load people with burdens /bcrdens/[重担] hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
{Luk 11:46} 耶稣说：“你们律法师也有祸了！因为你们把难担的担子放在人身上，自己一个指头却不肯动。
{Luk 11:47} Woe to you! For you build /bild/ the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed.
{Luk 11:47} 你们有祸了！因为你们修造先知的坟墓，那先知正是你们的祖宗所杀的。
{Luk 11:48} So you are witnesses and you consent /kCn'sent/[同感 同意] to the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their tombs.
{Luk 11:48} 可见你们祖宗所作的事，你们又证明又喜欢；因为他们杀了先知，你们修造先知的坟墓。
{Luk 11:49} Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,'
{Luk 11:49} 所以，神用智慧（用智慧：或作的智者）曾说：‘我要差遣先知和使徒到他们那里去，有的他们要杀害，有的他们要逼迫，’
{Luk 11:50} so that the blood of all the prophets, shed /Sed/[sh分离 > 流出] from the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,
{Luk 11:50} 使创世以来所流众先知血的罪都要问在这世代的人身上，
{Luk 11:51} from the blood of Abel /Abel/ to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. /sxnktSUary/[圣所] Yes, I tell you, it will be required /rE'kwIr/[需要 要求 < 重复问] of this generation.
{Luk 11:51} 就是从亚伯的血起，直到被杀在坛和殿中间撒迦利亚的血为止。我实在告诉你们，这都要问在这世代的人身上。
{Luk 11:52} Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. /nolEdZ/ You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered /hindcr/[阻碍 < 后面拉住] those who were entering."
{Luk 11:52} 你们律法师有祸了！因为你们把知识的钥匙夺了去，自己不进去，正要进去的人你们也阻挡他们。”
{Luk 11:53} As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard and to provoke /prO'vOk/[催逼 < 在前面叫] him to speak about many things,
{Luk 11:53} 耶稣从那里出来，文士和法利赛人就极力的催逼他，引动他多说话，
{Luk 11:54} lying in| wait for him, to catch him in something he might say.
{Luk 11:54} 私下窥听，要拿他的话柄。
{Luk 12:1}  In the meantime, /mEntIm/[m中间 > 其间] when so many thousands of the people had gathered together that they were trampling one another, he began to say to his disciples first, "Beware of the leaven /leven/[酵母] of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. /hi'pokrisy/
{Luk 12:1}  这时，有几万人聚集，甚至彼此践踏。耶稣开讲，先对门徒说：“你们要防备法利赛人的酵，就是假冒为善。
{Luk 12:2}  Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden /hiden/ that will not be known.
{Luk 12:2}  掩盖的事没有不露出来的；隐藏的事，没有不被人知道的。
{Luk 12:3}  Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered /wispcr/ in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops. /haustop/
{Luk 12:3}  因此，你们在暗中所说的，将要在明处被人听见；在内室附耳所说的，将要在房上被人宣扬。”
{Luk 12:4}  "I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do.
{Luk 12:4}  “我的朋友，我对你们说，那杀身体以后不能再做什么的，不要怕他们。
{Luk 12:5}  But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!
{Luk 12:5}  我要指示你们当怕的是谁：当怕那杀了以后又有权柄丢在地狱里的。我实在告诉你们，正要怕他。
{Luk 12:6}  Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God.
{Luk 12:6}  五个麻雀不是卖二分银子吗？但在神面前，一个也不忘记；
{Luk 12:7}  Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value /vxlU/ than many sparrows.
{Luk 12:7}  就是你们的头发，也都被数过了。不要惧怕，你们比许多麻雀还贵重！”
{Luk 12:8}  "And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges /ak'nolEdZ/[承认] me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God,
{Luk 12:8}  “我又告诉你们，凡在人面前认我的，人子在神的使者面前也必认他；
{Luk 12:9}  but the one who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
{Luk 12:9}  在人面前不认我的，人子在神的使者面前也必不认他；
{Luk 12:10} And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the one who blasphemes /blxs'fEm/ against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
{Luk 12:10} 凡说话干犯人子的，还可得赦免，惟独亵渎圣灵的，总不得赦免。
{Luk 12:11} And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how you should defend /dE'fend/[辩护] yourself or what you should say,
{Luk 12:11} 人带你们到会堂，并官府和有权柄的人面前，不要思虑怎么分诉，说什么话；
{Luk 12:12} for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say."
{Luk 12:12} 因为正在那时候，圣灵要指教你们当说的话。”
{Luk 12:13} Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance /in'heritans/ with me."
{Luk 12:13} 众人中有一个人对耶稣说：“夫子！请你吩咐我的兄长和我分开家业。”
{Luk 12:14} But he said to him, "Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator /arbitrAtcr/[仲裁] over you?"
{Luk 12:14} 耶稣说：“你这个人！谁立我作你们断事的官，给你们分家业呢？”
{Luk 12:15} And he said to them, "Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, /kcvetcs/[贪婪] for one's life does not consist /kCn'sist/[构成 < 一同坐立 并存] in the abundance /a'bCndans/ of his possessions." /pC'zeSCn/[占有物]
{Luk 12:15} 于是对众人说：“你们要谨慎自守，免去一切的贪心，因为人的生命不在乎家道丰富。”
{Luk 12:16} And he told them a parable, saying, "The land of a rich man produced plentifully,
{Luk 12:16} 就用比喻对他们说：“有一个财主田产丰盛；
{Luk 12:17} and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?' /krop/[收割 农作物]
{Luk 12:17} 自己心里思想说：‘我的出产没有地方收藏，怎么办呢？’
{Luk 12:18} And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
{Luk 12:18} 又说：‘我要这么办：要把我的仓房拆了，另盖更大的，在那里好收藏我一切的粮食和财物，
{Luk 12:19} And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have ample /xmpl/[充足] goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry."'
{Luk 12:19} 然后要对我的‘灵魂说：“灵魂哪，你有许多财物积存，可作多年的费用，只管安安逸逸的吃喝快乐吧！’
{Luk 12:20} But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'
{Luk 12:20} 神却对他说：‘无知的人哪，今夜必要你的灵魂；你所预备的要归谁呢？’
{Luk 12:21} So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God."
{Luk 12:21} 凡为自己积财，在神面前却不富足的，也是这样。”
{Luk 12:22} And he said to his disciples, "Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on.
{Luk 12:22} 耶稣又对门徒说：“所以我告诉你们，不要为生命忧虑吃什么，为身体忧虑穿什么；
{Luk 12:23} For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.
{Luk 12:23} 因为生命胜于饮食，身体胜于衣裳。
{Luk 12:24} Consider the ravens: /rAven/ they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!
{Luk 12:24} 你想乌鸦，也不种也不收，又没有仓又没有库，神尚且养活他。你们比飞鸟是何等的贵重呢！
{Luk 12:25} And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span /spxn/[指距] of life?
{Luk 12:25} 你们那一个能用思虑使寿数多加一刻呢（或作：使身量多加一肘呢）？
{Luk 12:26} If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest? [不动 > 休息 留下 ]
{Luk 12:26} 这最小的事，你们尚且不能做，为什么还忧虑其余的事呢？
{Luk 12:27} Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed /ar'rA/[盛装] like one of these.
{Luk 12:27} 你想百合花怎么长起来；他也不劳苦，也不纺线。然而我告诉你们，就是所罗门极荣华的时候，他所穿戴的，还不如这花一朵呢！
{Luk 12:28} But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive /a'lIv/ in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!
{Luk 12:28} 你们这小信的人哪，野地里的草今天还在，明天就丢在炉里，神还给他这样的妆饰，何况你们呢！
{Luk 12:29} And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be worried.
{Luk 12:29} 你们不要求吃什么，喝什么，也不要挂心；
{Luk 12:30} For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them.
{Luk 12:30} 这都是外邦人所求的。你们必须用这些东西，你们的父是知道的。
{Luk 12:31} Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you.
{Luk 12:31} 你们只要求他的国，这些东西就必加给你们了。
{Luk 12:32} "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
{Luk 12:32} 你们这小群，不要惧怕，因为你们的父乐意把国赐给你们。
{Luk 12:33} Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.
{Luk 12:33} 你们要变卖所有的周济人，为自己预备永不坏的钱囊，用不尽的财宝在天上，就是贼不能近、虫不能蛀的地方。
{Luk 12:34} For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
{Luk 12:34} 因为，你们的财宝在那里，你们的心也在那里。”
{Luk 12:35} "Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning,
{Luk 12:35} “你们腰里要束上带，灯也要点着，
{Luk 12:36} and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks.
{Luk 12:36} 自己好像仆人等候主人从婚姻的筵席上回来。他来到，叩门，就立刻给他开门。
{Luk 12:37} Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them.
{Luk 12:37} 主人来了，看见仆人警醒，那仆人就有福了。我实在告诉你们，主人必叫他们坐席，自己束上带，进前伺候他们。
{Luk 12:38} If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants!
{Luk 12:38} 或是二更天来，或是三更天来，看见仆人这样，那仆人就有福了。
{Luk 12:39} But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into.
{Luk 12:39} 家主若知道贼什么时候来，就必警醒，不容贼挖透房屋，这是你们所知道的。
{Luk 12:40} You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."[预期 < 看外面]
{Luk 12:40} 你们也要预备；因为你们想不到的时候，人子就来了。”
{Luk 12:41} Peter said, "Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?"
{Luk 12:41} 彼得说：“主啊，这比喻是为我们说的呢？还是为众人呢？”
{Luk 12:42} And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, /mxnadZcr/ whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper /propcr/[合宜] time?
{Luk 12:42} 主说：“谁是那忠心有见识的管家，主人派他管理家里的人，按时分粮给他们呢？
{Luk 12:43} Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.
{Luk 12:43} 主人来到，看见仆人这样行，那仆人就有福了。
{Luk 12:44} Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.
{Luk 12:44} 我实在告诉你们，主人要派他管理一切所有的。
{Luk 12:45} But if that servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed /dE'lA/[耽搁 迟延 < 拉长] in coming,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,
{Luk 12:45} 那仆人若心里说：‘我的主人必来得迟’，就动手打仆人和使女，并且吃喝醉酒；
{Luk 12:46} the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful.
{Luk 12:46} 在他想不到的日子，不知道的时辰，那仆人的主人要来，重重的处治他（或作：把他腰轧了），定他和不忠心的人同罪。
{Luk 12:47} And that servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe /sE'vEr/[严厉] beating.
{Luk 12:47} 仆人知道主人的意思，却不预备，又不顺他的意思行，那仆人必多受责打；
{Luk 12:48} But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted /en'trcst/[信赖 交托] much, they will demand [命令要求] the more.
{Luk 12:48} 惟有那不知道的，做了当受责打的事，必少受责打；因为多给谁，就向谁多取；多托谁，就向谁多要。”
{Luk 12:49} "I came to cast fire on the earth, and would [V-ed] that it were already kindled! [点燃]
{Luk 12:49} “我来要把火丢在地上，倘若已经着起来，不也是我所愿意的吗？
{Luk 12:50} I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how great is my distress /di'stres/[悲痛] until it is accomplished!
{Luk 12:50} 我有当受的洗还没有成就，我是何等的迫切呢？
{Luk 12:51} Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
{Luk 12:51} 你们以为我来，是叫地上太平吗？我告诉你们，不是，乃是叫人分争。
{Luk 12:52} For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three.
{Luk 12:52} 从今以后，一家五个人将要分争：三个人和两个人相争，两个人和三个人相争；
{Luk 12:53} They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."
{Luk 12:53} 父亲和儿子相争，儿子和父亲相争；母亲和女儿相争，女儿和母亲相争；婆婆和媳妇相争，媳妇和婆婆相争。”
{Luk 12:54} He also said to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, 'A shower /Saur/ is coming.' And so it happens.
{Luk 12:54} 耶稣又对众人说：“你们看见西边起了云彩，就说：‘要下一阵雨’；果然就有。
{Luk 12:55} And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, 'There will be scorching /skortS/[酷热 < 咬人] heat,' and it happens.
{Luk 12:55} 起了南风，就说：‘将要燥热’；也就有了。
{Luk 12:56} You hypocrites! You know how to interpret /in'tcrpret/[诠释 < 中间人介绍] the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?
{Luk 12:56} 假冒为善的人哪，你们知道分辨天地的气色，怎么不知道分辨这时候呢？”
{Luk 12:57} "And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?
{Luk 12:57} “你们又为何不自己审量什么是合理的呢？
{Luk 12:58} As you go with your accuser before the magistrate, /mxdZistrAt/[地方官] make an effort /efcrt/[努力 < f力量出去] to settle [解决] with him on the way, lest he drag [拖拉] you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, /ofiscr/[官员] and the officer put you in prison.
{Luk 12:58} 你同告你的对头去见官，还在路上，务要尽力的和他了结；恐怕他拉你到官面前，官交付差役，差役把你下在监里。
{Luk 12:59} I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny."
{Luk 12:59} 我告诉你，若有半文钱没有还清，你断不能从那里出来。”
{Luk 13:1}  There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate /pIlat/ had mingled /mingl/[搀杂] with their sacrifices. /sxkrifIs/[祭品]
{Luk 13:1}  正当那时，有人将彼拉多使加利利人的血搀杂在他们祭物中的事告诉耶稣。
{Luk 13:2}  And he answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered [遭受] in this way?
{Luk 13:2}  耶稣说；“你们以为这些加利利人比众加利利人更有罪，所以受这害吗？
{Luk 13:3}  No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
{Luk 13:3}  我告诉你们，不是的！你们若不悔改，都要如此灭亡！
{Luk 13:4}  Or those eighteen on whom the tower /taur/[塔楼] in Siloam /sI'lOam/ fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders /C'fendcr/[罪犯] than all the others who lived in Jerusalem?
{Luk 13:4}  从前西罗亚楼倒塌了，压死十八个人；你们以为那些人比一切住在耶路撒冷的人更有罪吗？
{Luk 13:5}  No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
{Luk 13:5}  我告诉你们，不是的！你们若不悔改，都要如此灭亡！”
{Luk 13:6}  And he told this parable: "A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, /vinyard/[葡萄园] and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.
{Luk 13:6}  于是用比喻说：“一个人有一棵无花果树栽在葡萄园里。他来到树前找果子，却找不着。
{Luk 13:7}  And he said to the vinedresser, /'vIn,drescr/[葡萄园丁] 'Look, for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down. Why should it use up [用完 用了] the ground?'
{Luk 13:7}  就对管园的说：‘看哪，我这三年来到这无花果树前找果子，竟找不着，把他砍了吧，何必白占地土呢！’
{Luk 13:8}  And he answered him, 'Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure. /ma'nUr/[肥料]
{Luk 13:8}  管园的说：‘主啊，今年且留着，等我周围掘开土，加上粪；
{Luk 13:9}  Then if it should bear fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.'"
{Luk 13:9}  以后若结果子便罢，不然再把他砍了。’”
{Luk 13:10} Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
{Luk 13:10} 安息日，耶稣在会堂里教训人。
{Luk 13:11} And behold, there was a woman who had had a disabling /dis'Abl/ spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself.
{Luk 13:11} 有一个女人被鬼附着，病了十八年，腰弯得一点直不起来。
{Luk 13:12} When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your disability." /disa'bility/[残疾]
{Luk 13:12} 耶稣看见，便叫过他来，对他说：“女人，你脱离这病了！”
{Luk 13:13} And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God.
{Luk 13:13} 于是用两只手按着他；他立刻直起腰来，就归荣耀与神。
{Luk 13:14} But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant /in'dignant/[愤怒] because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, "There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day."
{Luk 13:14} 管会堂的因为耶稣在安息日治病，就气忿忿的对众人说：“有六日应当做工；那六日之内可以来求医，在安息日却不可。”
{Luk 13:15} Then the Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey /donkE/ from the manger /mAndZcr/ and lead it away to water it?
{Luk 13:15} 主说：“假冒为善的人哪，难道你们各人在安息日不解开槽上的牛、驴，牵去饮吗？
{Luk 13:16} And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed /lws/ from this bond /bond/[连结] on the Sabbath day?"
{Luk 13:16} 况且这女人本是亚伯拉罕的后裔，被撒但捆绑了这十八年，不当在安息日解开他的绑吗？”
{Luk 13:17} As he said these things, all his adversaries /'xdvcr,sxry/[敌手] were put to shame, and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.
{Luk 13:17} 耶稣说这话，他的敌人都惭愧了；众人因他所行一切荣耀的事，就都欢喜了。
{Luk 13:18} He said therefore, "What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?
{Luk 13:18} 耶稣说：“神的国好像什么？我拿什么来比较呢？
{Luk 13:19} It is like a grain of mustard /mCstard/ seed that a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches."
{Luk 13:19} 好像一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在园子里，长大成树，天上的飞鸟宿在他的枝上。”
{Luk 13:20} And again he said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
{Luk 13:20} 又说：“我拿什么来比神的国呢？
{Luk 13:21} It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures /meZcr/ of flour, /flaur/ until it was all leavened."
{Luk 13:21} 好比面酵，有妇人拿来藏在三斗面里，直等全团都发起来。”
{Luk 13:22} He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem.
{Luk 13:22} 耶稣往耶路撒冷去，在所经过的各城各乡教训人。
{Luk 13:23} And someone said to him, "Lord, will those who are saved be few?" And he said to them,
{Luk 13:23} 有一个人问他说：“主啊，得救的人少吗？”
{Luk 13:24} "Strive /strIv/ to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.
{Luk 13:24} 耶稣对众人说：“你们要努力进窄门。我告诉你们，将来有许多人想要进去，却是不能。
{Luk 13:25} When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.'
{Luk 13:25} 及至家主起来关了门，你们站在外面叩门，说：‘主啊，给我们开门！’他就回答说：‘我不认识你们，不晓得你们是那里来的！’
{Luk 13:26} Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'
{Luk 13:26} 那时，你们要说：‘我们在你面前吃过喝过，你也在我们的街上教训过人。’
{Luk 13:27} But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!'
{Luk 13:27} 他要说：‘我告诉你们，我不晓得你们是那里来的。你们这一切作恶的人，离开我去吧！’
{Luk 13:28} In that place there will be weeping and gnashing /nxS/ of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac /IzAk/ and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out.
{Luk 13:28} 你们要看见亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，和众先知都在神的国里，你们却被赶到外面，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。
{Luk 13:29} And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God.
{Luk 13:29} 从东、从西、从南、从北将有人来，在神的国里坐席。
{Luk 13:30} And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last."
{Luk 13:30} 只是有在后的，将要在前；有在前的，将要在后。”
{Luk 13:31} At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, "Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you."
{Luk 13:31} 正当那时，有几个法利赛人来对耶稣说：“离开这里去吧，因为希律想要杀你。”
{Luk 13:32} And he said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course.
{Luk 13:32} 耶稣说：“你们去告诉那个狐狸说：‘今天、明天我赶鬼治病，第三天我的事就成全了。’
{Luk 13:33} Nevertheless, I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.'
{Luk 13:33} 虽然这样，今天、明天、后天，我必须前行，因为先知在耶路撒冷之外丧命是不能的。
{Luk 13:34} O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood /brwd/ under her wings, and you were not willing!
{Luk 13:34} 耶路撒冷啊！耶路撒冷啊！你常杀害先知，又用石头打死那奉差遣到你这里来的人。我多次愿意聚集你的儿女，好像母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下，只是你们不愿意。
{Luk 13:35} Behold, your house is forsaken. /for'sAk/[抛弃] And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
{Luk 13:35} 看哪，你们的家成为荒场留给你们。我告诉你们，从今以后你们不得再见我，直等到你们说：‘奉主名来的是应当称颂的。’”
{Luk 14:1}  One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were watching him carefully.
{Luk 14:1}  安息日，耶稣到一个法利赛人的首领家里去吃饭，他们就窥探他。
{Luk 14:2}  And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy. /dropsy/[水肿]
{Luk 14:2}  在他面前有一个患水臌的人。
{Luk 14:3}  And Jesus responded /rE'spond/[应答 < re反回 spond响音] to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?"
{Luk 14:3}  耶稣对律法师和法利赛人说：“安息日治病，可以不可以？”
{Luk 14:4}  But they remained silent. Then he took /tuk/ him and healed him and sent him away.
{Luk 14:4}  他们却不言语。耶稣就治好那人，叫他走了；
{Luk 14:5}  And he said to them, "Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?"
{Luk 14:5}  便对他们说：“你们中间谁有驴或有牛，在安息日掉在井里，不立时拉他上来呢？”
{Luk 14:6}  And they could not reply to these things.
{Luk 14:6}  他们不能对答这话。
{Luk 14:7}  Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed /nOtis/ how they chose the places of honor, saying to them,
{Luk 14:7}  耶稣见所请的客拣择首位，就用比喻对他们说：
{Luk 14:8}  "When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished /di'stingwiS/[显著] than you be invited by him,
{Luk 14:8}  “你被人请去赴婚姻的筵席，不要坐在首位上，恐怕有比你尊贵的客被他请来；
{Luk 14:9}  and he who invited you both will come and say to you, 'Give your place to this person,' and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place.
{Luk 14:9}  那请你们的人前来对你说：‘让座给这一位吧！’你就羞羞惭惭的退到末位上去了。
{Luk 14:10} But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you.
{Luk 14:10} 你被请的时候，就去坐在末位上，好叫那请你的人来对你说：‘朋友，请上坐。’那时，你在同席的人面前就有光彩了。
{Luk 14:11} For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."
{Luk 14:11} 因为，凡自高的，必降为卑，自卑的，必升为高。”
{Luk 14:12} He said also to the man who had invited him, "When you give a dinner or a banquet, /bxnkwet/[宴会] do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. /rE'pAd/
{Luk 14:12} 耶稣又对请他的人说：“你摆设午饭或晚饭，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属，和富足的邻舍，恐怕他们也请你，你就得了报答。
{Luk 14:13} But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, /lAm/ the blind,
{Luk 14:13} 你摆设筵席，倒要请那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了！
{Luk 14:14} and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just."
{Luk 14:14} 因为他们没有什么可报答你。到义人复活的时候，你要得着报答。”
{Luk 14:15} When one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things, he said to him, "Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!"
{Luk 14:15} 同席的有一人听见这话，就对耶稣说：“在神国里吃饭的有福了！”
{Luk 14:16} But he said to him, "A man once gave a great banquet and invited many.
{Luk 14:16} 耶稣对他说：“有一人摆设大筵席，请了许多客。
{Luk 14:17} And at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.'
{Luk 14:17} 到了坐席的时候，打发仆人去对所请的人说：‘请来吧！样样都齐备了。’
{Luk 14:18} But they all alike [相似的] began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought /bot/ a field, and I must go out and see it. Please have me excused.'
{Luk 14:18} 众人一口同音的推辞。头一个说：‘我买了一块地，必须去看看。请你准我辞了。’
{Luk 14:19} And another said, 'I have bought five yoke /yOk/[轭] of oxen, /oksen/ and I go to examine /eg'zxmin/[审查] them. Please have me excused.'
{Luk 14:19} 又有一个说：‘我买了五对牛，要去试一试。请你准我辞了。’
{Luk 14:20} And another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'
{Luk 14:20} 又有一个说：‘我才娶了妻，所以不能去。’
{Luk 14:21} So the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, 'Go out quickly to the streets and lanes /lAn/[小巷子] of the city, and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame.'
{Luk 14:21} 那仆人回来，把这事都告诉了主人。家主就动怒，对仆人说：‘快出去，到城里大街小巷，领那贫穷的、残废的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的来。’
{Luk 14:22} And the servant said, 'Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.'
{Luk 14:22} 仆人说：‘主啊，你所吩咐的已经办了，还有空座。’
{Luk 14:23} And the master said to the servant, 'Go out to the highways [大道] and hedges /hedZ/[篱笆] and compel /kcm'pel/[强迫 < 强推] people to come in, that my house may be filled.
{Luk 14:23} 主人对仆人说，‘你出去到路上和篱笆那里，勉强人进来，坐满我的屋子。
{Luk 14:24} For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.'"
{Luk 14:24} 我告诉你们，先前所请的人，没有一个得尝我的筵席。’”
{Luk 14:25} Now great crowds accompanied him, /a'kCmpany/[陪伴] and he turned and said to them,
{Luk 14:25} 有极多的人和耶稣同行。他转过来对他们说：
{Luk 14:26} "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.
{Luk 14:26} “人到我这里来，若不爱我胜过爱（爱我胜过爱：原文作恨）自己的父母、妻子、儿女、弟兄、姐妹，和自己的性命，就不能作我的门徒。
{Luk 14:27} Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.
{Luk 14:27} 凡不背着自己十字架跟从我的，也不能作我的门徒。
{Luk 14:28} For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete /kCm'plEt/ it?
{Luk 14:28} 你们那一个要盖一座楼，不先坐下算计花费，能盖成不能呢？
{Luk 14:29} Otherwise, [否则] when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock /mok/[嘲笑] him,
{Luk 14:29} 恐怕安了地基，不能成功，看见的人都笑话他，说：
{Luk 14:30} saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'
{Luk 14:30} ‘这个人开了工，却不能完工。’
{Luk 14:31} Or what king, going out to encounter /en'kauntcr/[相会] another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate /dE'libcrAt/[斟酌] whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
{Luk 14:31} 或是一个王出去和别的王打仗，岂不先坐下酌量，能用一万兵去敌那领二万兵来攻打他的吗？
{Luk 14:32} And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation /delE'gASCn/[代表者] and asks for terms of peace.
{Luk 14:32} 若是不能，就趁敌人还远的时候，派使者去求和息的条款。
{Luk 14:33} So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce /rE'nauns/[弃权 放弃] all that he has cannot be my disciple.
{Luk 14:33} 这样，你们无论什么人，若不撇下一切所有的，就不能作我的门徒。”
{Luk 14:34} "Salt is good, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?
{Luk 14:34} “盐本是好的；盐若失了味，可用什么叫他再咸呢？
{Luk 14:35} It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile. /pIl/[堆] It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
{Luk 14:35} 或用在田里，或堆在粪里，都不合式，只好丢在外面。有耳可听的，就应当听！”
{Luk 15:1}  Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him.
{Luk 15:1}  众税吏和罪人都挨近耶稣，要听他讲道。
{Luk 15:2}  And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them."
{Luk 15:2}  法利赛人和文士私下议论说：“这个人接待罪人，又同他们吃饭。”
{Luk 15:3}  So he told them this parable:
{Luk 15:3}  耶稣就用比喻说：
{Luk 15:4}  "What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, [Phr.n开阔的田野] and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?
{Luk 15:4}  “你们中间谁有一百只羊失去一只，不把这九十九只撇在旷野、去找那失去的羊，直到找着呢？
{Luk 15:5}  And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
{Luk 15:5}  找着了，就欢欢喜喜的扛在肩上，回到家里，
{Luk 15:6}  And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.'
{Luk 15:6}  就请朋友邻舍来，对他们说：‘我失去的羊已经找着了，你们和我一同欢喜吧！’
{Luk 15:7}  Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.
{Luk 15:7}  我告诉你们，一个罪人悔改，在天上也要这样为他欢喜，较比为九十九个不用悔改的义人欢喜更大。”
{Luk 15:8}  "Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses /lus/ one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep /swEp/ the house and seek diligently until she finds it?
{Luk 15:8}  “或是一个妇人有十块钱，若失落一块，岂不点上灯，打扫屋子，细细的找，直到找着吗？
{Luk 15:9}  And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.'
{Luk 15:9}  找着了，就请朋友邻舍来，对他们说：‘我失落的那块钱已经找着了，你们和我一同欢喜吧！’
{Luk 15:10} Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents."
{Luk 15:10} 我告诉你们，一个罪人悔改，在神的使者面前也是这样为他欢喜。”
{Luk 15:11} And he said, "There was a man who had two sons.
{Luk 15:11} 耶稣又说：“一个人有两个儿子。
{Luk 15:12} And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share /SAr/[分配] of property /propcrty/ that is coming to me.' And he divided his property between them.
{Luk 15:12} 小儿子对父亲说：‘父亲，请你把我应得的家业分给我。’他父亲就把产业分给他们。
{Luk 15:13} Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered /skwandcr/[挥霍] his property in reckless /rek,les/[不顾虑] living.
{Luk 15:13} 过了不多几日，小儿子就把他一切所有的都收拾起来，往远方去了。在那里任意放荡，浪费资财。
{Luk 15:14} And when he had spent everything, a severe /sE'vEr/[严厉] famine /fxmin/[饥荒] arose in that country, and he began to be in need. [Phr.prep在穷困中]
{Luk 15:14} 既耗尽了一切所有的，又遇着那地方大遭饥荒，就穷苦起来。
{Luk 15:15} So he went and hired /hIr/[雇佣] himself out to one of the citizens[市民] of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
{Luk 15:15} 于是去投靠那地方的一个人；那人打发他到田里去放猪。
{Luk 15:16} And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.
{Luk 15:16} 他恨不得拿猪所吃的豆荚充饥，也没有人给他。
{Luk 15:17} "But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!
{Luk 15:17} 他醒悟过来，就说：‘我父亲有多少的雇工，口粮有余，我倒在这里饿死吗？
{Luk 15:18} I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.
{Luk 15:18} 我要起来，到我父亲那里去，向他说：父亲！我得罪了天，又得罪了你；
{Luk 15:19} I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat /trEt/[伸出 > 接待 对待] me as one of your hired servants."'
{Luk 15:19} 从今以后，我不配称为你的儿子，把我当作一个雇工吧！’
{Luk 15:20} And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, /kcm'pxSCn/[怜悯] and ran and embraced /em'brAs/ him and kissed him.
{Luk 15:20} 于是起来，往他父亲那里去。相离还远，他父亲看见，就动了慈心，跑去抱着他的颈项，连连与他亲嘴。
{Luk 15:21} And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
{Luk 15:21} 儿子说：‘父亲！我得罪了天，又得罪了你；从今以后，我不配称为你的儿子。’
{Luk 15:22} But the father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.
{Luk 15:22} 父亲却吩咐仆人说：‘把那上好的袍子快拿出来给他穿；把戒指戴在他指头上；把鞋穿在他脚上；
{Luk 15:23} And bring the fattened /txten/[养肥] calf /kxf/[小牛] and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. /selEbrAt/[庆祝]
{Luk 15:23} 把那肥牛犊牵来宰了，我们可以吃喝快乐；
{Luk 15:24} For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.' And they began to celebrate.
{Luk 15:24} 因为我这个儿子是死而复活，失而又得的。’他们就快乐起来。
{Luk 15:25} "Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
{Luk 15:25} 那时，大儿子正在田里。他回来，离家不远，听见作乐跳舞的声音，
{Luk 15:26} And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. /ment/
{Luk 15:26} 便叫过一个仆人来，问是什么事。
{Luk 15:27} And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.'
{Luk 15:27} 仆人说：‘你兄弟来了；你父亲因为得他无灾无病的回来，把肥牛犊宰了。’
{Luk 15:28} But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated /en'trEt/[恳求] him,
{Luk 15:28} 大儿子却生气，不肯进去；他父亲就出来劝他。
{Luk 15:29} but he answered his father, 'Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.
{Luk 15:29} 他对父亲说：‘我服事你这多年，从来没有违背过你的命，你并没有给我一只山羊羔，叫我和朋友一同快乐。
{Luk 15:30} But when this son of yours came, who has devoured /dE'vaur/ your property with prostitutes, /prostitUt/[放在前面当出售品 > 娼妓] you killed the fattened calf for him!'
{Luk 15:30} 但你这个儿子和娼妓吞尽了你的产业，他一来了，你倒为他宰了肥牛犊。’
{Luk 15:31} And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.
{Luk 15:31} 父亲对他说：‘儿啊！你常和我同在，我一切所有的都是你的；
{Luk 15:32} It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.'"
{Luk 15:32} 只是你这个兄弟是死而复活、失而又得的，所以我们理当欢喜快乐。’”
{Luk 16:1}  He also said to the disciples, "There was a rich man who had a manager, /mxnadZcr/ and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions.
{Luk 16:1}  耶稣又对门徒说：“有一个财主的管家，别人向他主人告他浪费主人的财物。
{Luk 16:2}  And he called him and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Turn in [上缴] the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'
{Luk 16:2}  主人叫他来，对他说：‘我听见你这事怎么样呢？把你所经管的交代明白，因你不能再作我的管家。’
{Luk 16:3}  And the manager said to himself, 'What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.
{Luk 16:3}  那管家心里说：‘主人辞我，不用我再作管家，我将来做什么？锄地呢？无力；讨饭呢？怕羞。
{Luk 16:4}  I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.'
{Luk 16:4}  我知道怎么行，好叫人在我不作管家之后，接我到他们家里去。’
{Luk 16:5}  So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'
{Luk 16:5}  于是把欠他主人债的，一个一个的叫了来，问头一个说：‘你欠我主人多少？’
{Luk 16:6}  He said, 'A hundred measures of oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'
{Luk 16:6}  他说：‘一百篓（每篓约五十斤）油。’管家说：‘拿你的账，快坐下，写五十。’
{Luk 16:7}  Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'
{Luk 16:7}  又问一个说：‘你欠多少？’他说：‘一百石麦子。’管家说：‘拿你的账，写八十。’
{Luk 16:8}  The master commended /kC'mend/ the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. /Srud/[精明 < 看透] For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light.
{Luk 16:8}  主人就夸奖这不义的管家做事聪明；因为今世之子，在世事之上，较比光明之子更加聪明。
{Luk 16:9}  And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, /welth/[财富] so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings. /dwel/[住处]
{Luk 16:9}  我又告诉你们，要藉着那不义的钱财结交朋友，到了钱财无用的时候，他们可以接你们到永存的帐幕里去。
{Luk 16:10} "One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.
{Luk 16:10} 人在最小的事上忠心，在大事上也忠心；在最小的事上不义，在大事上也不义。
{Luk 16:11} If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?
{Luk 16:11} 倘若你们在不义的钱财上不忠心，谁还把那真实的钱财托付你们呢？
{Luk 16:12} And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?
{Luk 16:12} 倘若你们在别人的东西上不忠心，谁还把你们自己的东西给你们呢？
{Luk 16:13} No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted /dE'vOt/[献身] to the one and despise /dE'spIs/[轻视] the other. You cannot serve God and money."
{Luk 16:13} 一个仆人不能事奉两个主；不是恶这个爱那个，就是重这个轻那个。你们不能又事奉神，又事奉玛门。”
{Luk 16:14} The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed /ridikUl/[嗤笑] him.
{Luk 16:14} 法利赛人是贪爱钱财的，他们听见这一切话，就嗤笑耶稣。
{Luk 16:15} And he said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination /a'bomi,nASCn/[憎恶] in the sight of God.
{Luk 16:15} 耶稣对他们说：“你们是在人面前自称为义的，你们的心，神却知道；因为人所尊贵的，是神看为可憎恶的。
{Luk 16:16} "The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it.
{Luk 16:16} 律法和先知到约翰为止，从此神国的福音传开了，人人努力要进去。
{Luk 16:17} But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void. [空]
{Luk 16:17} 天地废去较比律法的一点一画落空还容易。
{Luk 16:18} "Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.
{Luk 16:18} 凡休妻另娶的就是犯奸淫；娶被休之妻的也是犯奸淫。”
{Luk 16:19} "There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen /linen/ and who feasted sumptuously /scmptSUcs/[奢侈] every day.
{Luk 16:19} 有一个财主穿着紫色袍和细麻布衣服，天天奢华宴乐。
{Luk 16:20} And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, /sor/[伤痛处]
{Luk 16:20} 又有一个讨饭的，名叫拉撒路，浑身生疮，被人放在财主门口，
{Luk 16:21} who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
{Luk 16:21} 要得财主桌子上掉下来的零碎充饥；并且狗来舔他的疮。
{Luk 16:22} The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried,
{Luk 16:22} 后来那讨饭的死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。财主也死了，并且埋葬了。
{Luk 16:23} and in Hades, /hAdEs/ being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.
{Luk 16:23} 他在阴间受痛苦，举目远远的望见亚伯拉罕，又望见拉撒路在他怀里，
{Luk 16:24} And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish /xngwiS/[极其痛苦] in this flame.' /flAm/[火焰]
{Luk 16:24} 就喊着说：‘我祖亚伯拉罕哪，可怜我吧！打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头；因为我在这火焰里，极其痛苦。’
{Luk 16:25} But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you in your lifetime [一生的时间] received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner /mxncr/[举止] [phr.同样地] bad things; but now he is comforted /komfcrt/ here, and you are in anguish.
{Luk 16:25} 亚伯拉罕说：‘儿啊，你该回想你生前享过福，拉撒路也受过苦；如今他在这里得安慰，你倒受痛苦。
{Luk 16:26} And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm /kxzm/[深坑裂口] has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.'
{Luk 16:26} 不但这样，并且在你我之间，有深渊限定，以致人要从这边过到你们那边是不能的；要从那边过到我们这边也是不能的。’
{Luk 16:27} And he said, 'Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house—
{Luk 16:27} 财主说：‘我祖啊！既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去；
{Luk 16:28} for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.'
{Luk 16:28} 因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。’
{Luk 16:29} But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.'
{Luk 16:29} 亚伯拉罕说：‘他们有摩西和先知的话可以听从。’
{Luk 16:30} And he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
{Luk 16:30} 他说：‘我祖亚伯拉罕哪，不是的，若有一个从死里复活的，到他们那里去的，他们必要悔改。’
{Luk 16:31} He said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced /kCn'vins/[说服] if someone should rise from the dead.'"
{Luk 16:31} 亚伯拉罕说：‘若不听从摩西和先知的话，就是有一个从死里复活的，他们也是不听劝。’”
{Luk 17:1}  And he said to his disciples, "Temptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come!
{Luk 17:1}  耶稣又对门徒说：“绊倒人的事是免不了的；但那绊倒人的有祸了。
{Luk 17:2}  It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin.
{Luk 17:2}  就是把磨石拴在这人的颈项上，丢在海里，还强如他把这小子里的一个绊倒了。
{Luk 17:3}  Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him,
{Luk 17:3}  你们要谨慎！若是你的弟兄得罪你，就劝戒他；他若懊悔，就饶恕他。
{Luk 17:4}  and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him."
{Luk 17:4}  倘若他一天七次得罪你，又七次回转，说：‘我懊悔了’，你总要饶恕他。”
{Luk 17:5}  The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"
{Luk 17:5}  使徒对主说：“求主加增我们的信心。”
{Luk 17:6}  And the Lord said, "If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry /mclbery/ tree, 'Be uprooted /Cp'rut/ and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.
{Luk 17:6}  主说：“你们若有信心像一粒芥菜种，就是对这棵桑树说：‘你要拔起根来，栽在海里’，他也必听从你们。
{Luk 17:7}  "Will any one of you who has a servant plowing /plau/ or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come at once and recline at table'?
{Luk 17:7}  你们谁有仆人耕地或是放羊，从田里回来，就对他说：‘你快来坐下吃饭’呢？
{Luk 17:8}  Will he not rather say to him, 'Prepare supper for me, and dress properly, [体面] and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink'?
{Luk 17:8}  岂不对他说：‘你给我预备晚饭，束上带子伺候我，等我吃喝完了，你才可以吃喝’吗？
{Luk 17:9}  Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded?
{Luk 17:9}  仆人照所吩咐的去做，主人还谢谢他吗？
{Luk 17:10} So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.'" /duty/[责任]
{Luk 17:10} 这样，你们做完了一切所吩咐的，只当说：‘我们是无用的仆人，所做的本是我们应分作的。’”
{Luk 17:11} On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.
{Luk 17:11} 耶稣往耶路撒冷去，经过撒玛利亚和加利利。
{Luk 17:12} And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance /di'stans/[远距离]
{Luk 17:12} 进入一个村子，有十个长大麻疯的，迎面而来，远远的站着，
{Luk 17:13} and lifted up their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us."
{Luk 17:13} 高声说：“耶稣，夫子，可怜我们吧！”
{Luk 17:14} When he saw them he said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And as they went they were cleansed.
{Luk 17:14} 耶稣看见，就对他们说：“你们去把身体给祭司察看。”他们去的时候就洁净了。
{Luk 17:15} Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice;
{Luk 17:15} 内中有一个见自己已经好了，就回来大声归荣耀与神，
{Luk 17:16} and he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan.
{Luk 17:16} 又俯伏在耶稣脚前感谢他；这人是撒玛利亚人。
{Luk 17:17} Then Jesus answered, "Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?
{Luk 17:17} 耶稣说：“洁净了的不是十个人吗？那九个在那里呢？
{Luk 17:18} Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?" /forAncr/
{Luk 17:18} 除了这外族人，再没有别人回来归荣耀与神吗？”
{Luk 17:19} And he said to him, "Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well."
{Luk 17:19} 就对那人说：“起来，走吧！你的信救了你了。”
{Luk 17:20} Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, "The kingdom of God is not coming in ways that can be observed, /Cb'scrv/[观察]
{Luk 17:20} 法利赛人问：“神的国几时来到？”耶稣回答说：“神的国来到不是眼所能见的。
{Luk 17:21} nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There!' for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you."
{Luk 17:21} 人也不得说：‘看哪，在这里！看哪，在那里！’因为神的国就在你们心里（心里：或作中间）。”
{Luk 17:22} And he said to the disciples, "The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.
{Luk 17:22} 他又对门徒说：“日子将到，你们巴不得看见人子的一个日子，却不得看见。
{Luk 17:23} And they will say to you, 'Look, there!' or 'Look, here!' Do not go out or follow them.
{Luk 17:23} 人将要对你们说：‘看哪，在那里！看哪，在这里！’你们不要出去，也不要跟随他们！
{Luk 17:24} For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.
{Luk 17:24} 因为人子在他降临的日子，好像闪电从天这边一闪直照到天那边。
{Luk 17:25} But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
{Luk 17:25} 只是他必须先受许多苦，又被这世代弃绝。
{Luk 17:26} Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
{Luk 17:26} 挪亚的日子怎样，人子的日子也要怎样。
{Luk 17:27} They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
{Luk 17:27} 那时候的人又吃又喝，又娶又嫁，到挪亚进方舟的那日，洪水就来，把他们全都灭了。
{Luk 17:28} Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot—they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building,
{Luk 17:28} 又好像罗得的日子；人又吃又喝，又买又卖，又耕种又盖造。
{Luk 17:29} but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, /sodcm/ fire and sulfur /sClfcr/ rained from heaven and destroyed them all—
{Luk 17:29} 到罗得出所多玛的那日，就有火与硫磺从天上降下来，把他们全都灭了。
{Luk 17:30} so will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
{Luk 17:30} 人子显现的日子也要这样。
{Luk 17:31} On that day, let the one who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away, and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back.
{Luk 17:31} 当那日，人在房上，器具在屋里，不要下来拿；人在田里，也不要回家。
{Luk 17:32} Remember Lot's wife.
{Luk 17:32} 你们要回想罗得的妻子。
{Luk 17:33} Whoever seeks to preserve /prE'zcrv/[预先保存] his life will lose /lws/ it, but whoever loses his life will keep it.
{Luk 17:33} 凡想要保全生命的，必丧掉生命；凡丧掉生命的，必救活生命。
{Luk 17:34} I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken and the other left.
{Luk 17:34} 我对你们说，当那一夜，两个人在一个床上，要取去一个，撇下一个。
{Luk 17:35} There will be two women grinding /grInd/ together. One will be taken and the other left."
{Luk 17:35} 两个女人一同推磨；要取去一个，撇下一个。
{Luk 17:36} Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
{Luk 17:36} （有古卷在此有“两个人在田里，要取去一个，撇下一个。”）”
{Luk 17:37} And they said to him, "Where, Lord?" He said to them, "Where the corpse is, there the vultures will gather."
{Luk 17:37} 门徒说：“主啊，在那里有这事呢？”耶稣说：“尸首在那里，鹰也必聚在那里。”
{Luk 18:1}  And he told them a parable to the effect /e'fekt/[效果] that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.
{Luk 18:1}  耶稣设一个比喻，是要人常常祷告，不可灰心。
{Luk 18:2}  He said, "In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected /rE'spekt/[尊敬] man.
{Luk 18:2}  说：“某城里有一个官，不惧怕神，也不尊重世人。
{Luk 18:3}  And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, 'Give me justice against my adversary.' /xdvcrsxry/[对手]
{Luk 18:3}  那城里有个寡妇，常到他那里，说：‘我有一个对头，求你给我伸冤。’
{Luk 18:4}  For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God nor respect man,
{Luk 18:4}  他多日不准。后来心里说：‘我虽不惧怕神，也不尊重世人，
{Luk 18:5}  yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down [打下来 平息] by her continual /kCn'tinUal/[继续] coming.'"
{Luk 18:5}  只因这寡妇烦扰我，我就给他伸冤吧，免得他常来缠磨我！’”
{Luk 18:6}  And the Lord said, "Hear what the unrighteous judge says.
{Luk 18:6}  主说：“你们听这不义之官所说的话。
{Luk 18:7}  And will not God give justice to his elect, /E'lekt/[选民] who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them?
{Luk 18:7}  神的选民昼夜呼吁他，他纵然为他们忍了多时，岂不终久给他们伸冤吗？
{Luk 18:8}  I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. /spEdily/ Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?"
{Luk 18:8}  我告诉你们，要快快的给他们伸冤了。然而，人子来的时候，遇得见世上有信德吗？”
{Luk 18:9}  He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: /kCn'tempt/[藐视]
{Luk 18:9}  耶稣向那些仗着自己是义人，藐视别人的，设一个比喻，
{Luk 18:10} "Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
{Luk 18:10} 说：“有两个人上殿里去祷告：一个是法利赛人，一个是税吏。
{Luk 18:11} The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, /eks'torSCncr/[敲诈者] unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
{Luk 18:11} 法利赛人站着，自言自语的祷告说：‘神啊，我感谢你，我不像别人勒索、不义、奸淫，也不像这个税吏。
{Luk 18:12} I fast twice /twIs/ a week; I give tithes /tIdh/ of all that I get.'
{Luk 18:12} 我一个礼拜禁食两次，凡我所得的都捐上十分之一。’
{Luk 18:13} But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'
{Luk 18:13} 那税吏远远的站着，连举目望天也不敢，只捶着胸说：‘神啊，开恩可怜我这个罪人！’
{Luk 18:14} I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."
{Luk 18:14} 我告诉你们，这人回家去比那人倒算为义了；因为，凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。”
{Luk 18:15} Now they were bringing even infants [in否定 f=ph语音 > 不会说话] to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
{Luk 18:15} 有人抱着自己的婴孩来见耶稣，要他摸他们；门徒看见就责备那些人。
{Luk 18:16} But Jesus called them to him, saying, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder /hindcr/[阻碍] them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.
{Luk 18:16} 耶稣却叫他们来，说：“让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们；因为在神国的正是这样的人。
{Luk 18:17} Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."
{Luk 18:17} 我实在告诉你们，凡要承受神国的，若不像小孩子，断不能进去。”
{Luk 18:18} And a ruler asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
{Luk 18:18} 有一个官问耶稣说：“良善的夫子，我该做什么事才可以承受永生？”
{Luk 18:19} And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.
{Luk 18:19} 耶稣对他说：“你为什么称我是良善的？除了神一位之外，再没有良善的。
{Luk 18:20} You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.'"
{Luk 18:20} 诫命你是晓得的：‘不可奸淫；不可杀人；不可偷盗；不可作假见证；当孝敬父母。’”
{Luk 18:21} And he said, "All these I have kept from my youth."
{Luk 18:21} 那人说：“这一切我从小都遵守了。”
{Luk 18:22} When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "One thing you still lack. /lxk/ Sell all that you have and distribute /di'stribUt/[分配给] to the poor, /pwr/ and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
{Luk 18:22} 耶稣听见了，就说：“你还缺少一件：要变卖你一切所有的，分给穷人，就必有财宝在天上；你还要来跟从我。”
{Luk 18:23} But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely /ek'strEm/[极端 极度 末端 < 最外面] rich.
{Luk 18:23} 他听见这话，就甚忧愁，因为他很富足。
{Luk 18:24} Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, "How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!
{Luk 18:24} 耶稣看见他，就说：“有钱财的人进神的国是何等的难哪！
{Luk 18:25} For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
{Luk 18:25} 骆驼穿过针的眼比财主进神的国还容易呢！”
{Luk 18:26} Those who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"
{Luk 18:26} 听见的人说：“这样，谁能得救呢？”
{Luk 18:27} But he said, "What is impossible with man is possible with God."
{Luk 18:27} 耶稣说：“在人所不能的事，在神却能。”
{Luk 18:28} And Peter said, "See, we have left our homes and followed you."
{Luk 18:28} 彼得说：“看哪，我们已经撇下自己所有的跟从你了。”
{Luk 18:29} And he said to them, "Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents /pArent/ or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
{Luk 18:29} 耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们，人为神的国撇下房屋，或是妻子、弟兄、父母、儿女，
{Luk 18:30} who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life."
{Luk 18:30} 没有在今世不得百倍，在来世不得永生的。”
{Luk 18:31} And taking the twelve, he said to them, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.
{Luk 18:31} 耶稣带着十二个门徒，对他们说：“看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，先知所写的一切事都要成就在人子身上。
{Luk 18:32} For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked [m模仿 戏弄] and shamefully [羞耻] treated and spit upon.
{Luk 18:32} 他将要被交给外邦人，他们要戏弄他，凌辱他，吐唾沫在他脸上，
{Luk 18:33} And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise."
{Luk 18:33} 并要鞭打他，杀害他；第三日他要复活。”
{Luk 18:34} But they understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp /grxsp/[抓住 掌握] what was said.
{Luk 18:34} 这些事门徒一样也不懂得，意思乃是隐藏的；他们不晓得所说的是什么。
{Luk 18:35} As he drew near to Jericho, /dZerikO/ a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
{Luk 18:35} 耶稣将近耶利哥的时候，有一个瞎子坐在路旁讨饭。
{Luk 18:36} And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired /in'kwIr/ what this meant.
{Luk 18:36} 听见许多人经过，就问是什么事。
{Luk 18:37} They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."
{Luk 18:37} 他们告诉他，是拿撒勒人耶稣经过。
{Luk 18:38} And he cried out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
{Luk 18:38} 他就呼叫说：“大卫的子孙耶稣啊，可怜我吧！”
{Luk 18:39} And those who were in front /frCnt/ rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, [phr.更加] "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
{Luk 18:39} 在前头走的人就责备他，不许他作声；他却越发喊叫说：“大卫的子孙，可怜我吧！”
{Luk 18:40} And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,
{Luk 18:40} 耶稣站住，吩咐把他领过来，到了跟前，就问他说：
{Luk 18:41} "What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "Lord, let me recover my sight."
{Luk 18:41} “你要我为你做什么？”他说：“主啊，我要能看见。”
{Luk 18:42} And Jesus said to him, "Recover your sight; your faith has made you well."
{Luk 18:42} 耶稣说：“你可以看见！你的信救了你了。”
{Luk 18:43} And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
{Luk 18:43} 瞎子立刻看见了，就跟随耶稣，一路归荣耀与神。众人看见这事，也赞美神。
{Luk 19:1}  He entered Jericho and was passing through.
{Luk 19:1}  耶稣进了耶利哥，正经过的时候，
{Luk 19:2}  And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. /zx'kECs/ He was a chief tax collector and was rich.
{Luk 19:2}  有一个人名叫撒该，作税吏长，是个财主。
{Luk 19:3}  And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature. /stxtScr/[身量]
{Luk 19:3}  他要看看耶稣是怎样的人；只因人多，他的身量又矮，所以不得看见，
{Luk 19:4}  So he ran on ahead and climbed /klIm/ up into a sycamore /'sika,mor/[枫树的一种] tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way.
{Luk 19:4}  就跑到前头，爬上桑树，要看耶稣，因为耶稣必从那里经过。
{Luk 19:5}  And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today."
{Luk 19:5}  耶稣到了那里，抬头一看，对他说：“撒该，快下来！今天我必住在你家里。”
{Luk 19:6}  So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully.
{Luk 19:6}  他就急忙下来，欢欢喜喜的接待耶稣。
{Luk 19:7}  And when they saw it, they all grumbled, "He has gone /gon/ in to be the guest /gest/ of a man who is a sinner."
{Luk 19:7}  众人看见，都私下议论说：“他竟到罪人家里去住宿。”
{Luk 19:8}  And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded /dE'frod/ anyone of anything, I restore /rE'stor/ it fourfold." /forfOld/
{Luk 19:8}  撒该站着对主说：“主啊，我把所有的一半给穷人；我若讹诈了谁，就还他四倍。”
{Luk 19:9}  And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.
{Luk 19:9}  耶稣说：“今天救恩到了这家，因为他也是亚伯拉罕的子孙。
{Luk 19:10} For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."
{Luk 19:10} 人子来，为要寻找，拯救失丧的人。”
{Luk 19:11} As they heard these things, he proceeded /prC'sEd/ to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed /sC'pOs/ that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
{Luk 19:11} 众人正在听见这些话的时候，耶稣因为将近耶路撒冷，又因他们以为神的国快要显出来，就另设一个比喻，说：
{Luk 19:12} He said therefore, "A nobleman /nOblman/ went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
{Luk 19:12} “有一个贵胄往远方去，要得国回来，
{Luk 19:13} Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, /mIna/ and said to them, 'Engage /en'gAdZ/ in business until I come.'
{Luk 19:13} 便叫了他的十个仆人来，交给他们十锭（锭：原文作弥拿约银十两）银子，说：‘你们去做生意，直等我回来。’
{Luk 19:14} But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation /delE'gASCn/ after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.'
{Luk 19:14} 他本国的人却恨他，打发使者随后去，说：‘我们不愿意这个人作我们的王。’
{Luk 19:15} When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained /gAn/ by doing business.
{Luk 19:15} 他既得国回来，就吩咐叫那领银子的仆人来，要知道他们作生意赚了多少。
{Luk 19:16} The first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.'
{Luk 19:16} 头一个上来，说：‘主啊，你的一锭银子已经赚了十锭。’
{Luk 19:17} And he said to him, 'Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'
{Luk 19:17} 主人说：‘好！良善的仆人，你既在最小的事上有忠心，可以有权柄管十座城。’
{Luk 19:18} And the second came, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made five minas.'
{Luk 19:18} 第二个来，说：‘主啊！你的一锭银子，已经赚了五锭。’
{Luk 19:19} And he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.'
{Luk 19:19} 主人说：‘你也可以管五座城。’
{Luk 19:20} Then another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief; /hxndkcrtSEf/
{Luk 19:20} 又有一个来说：‘主啊，看哪，你的一锭银子在这里，我把他包在手巾里存着。
{Luk 19:21} for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take what you did not deposit, /dE'pozit/ and reap what you did not sow.'
{Luk 19:21} 我原是怕你，因为你是严厉的人；没有放下的，还要去拿；没有种下的，还要去收。’
{Luk 19:22} He said to him, 'I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?
{Luk 19:22} 主人对他说：‘你这恶仆，我要凭你的口定你的罪。你既知道我是严厉的人，没有放下的，还要去拿，没有种下的，还要去收，
{Luk 19:23} Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?' /intrest/[当中利益 > 利息 兴趣]
{Luk 19:23} 为什么不把我的银子交给银行，等我来的时候，连本带利都可以要回来呢？’
{Luk 19:24} And he said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.'
{Luk 19:24} 就对旁边站着的人说：‘夺过他这一锭来，给那有十锭的。’
{Luk 19:25} And they said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!'
{Luk 19:25} 他们说：‘主啊，他已经有十锭了。’
{Luk 19:26} 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
{Luk 19:26} 主人说：‘我告诉你们，凡有的，还要加给他；没有的，连他所有的也要夺过来。
{Luk 19:27} But as for these enemies /enemy/ of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter /slotcr/ them before me.'"
{Luk 19:27} 至于我那些仇敌，不要我作他们王的，把他们拉来，在我面前杀了吧！’”
{Luk 19:28} And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
{Luk 19:28} 耶稣说完了这话，就在前面走，上耶路撒冷去。
{Luk 19:29} When he drew near to Bethphage /bethfadZ/ and Bethany, /bethany/ at the mount that is called Olivet, /olivet/ he sent two of the disciples,
{Luk 19:29} 将近伯法其和伯大尼，在一座山名叫橄榄山那里，就打发两个门徒，说：
{Luk 19:30} saying, "Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt /kOlt/ tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here.
{Luk 19:30} “你们往对面村子里去，进去的时候，必看见一匹驴驹拴在那里，是从来没有人骑过的，可以解开牵来。
{Luk 19:31} If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say this: 'The Lord has need of it.'"
{Luk 19:31} 若有人问为什么解他，你们就说：‘主要用他。’”
{Luk 19:32} So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.
{Luk 19:32} 打发的人去了，所遇见的正如耶稣所说的。
{Luk 19:33} And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
{Luk 19:33} 他们解驴驹的时候，主人问他们说：“解驴驹做什么？”
{Luk 19:34} And they said, "The Lord has need of it."
{Luk 19:34} 他们说：“主要用他。”
{Luk 19:35} And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks /klOk/ on the colt, they set Jesus on it.
{Luk 19:35} 他们牵到耶稣那里，把自己的衣服搭在上面，扶着耶稣骑上。
{Luk 19:36} And as he rode along, they spread /spred/ their cloaks on the road.
{Luk 19:36} 走的时候，众人把衣服铺在路上。
{Luk 19:37} As he was drawing near—already on the way down the Mount of Olives—the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,
{Luk 19:37} 将近耶路撒冷，正下橄榄山的时候，众门徒因所见过的一切异能，都欢乐起来，大声赞美神，
{Luk 19:38} saying, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"
{Luk 19:38} 说：奉主名来的王是应当称颂的！在天上有和平；在至高之处有荣光。
{Luk 19:39} And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples."
{Luk 19:39} 众人中有几个法利赛人对耶稣说：“夫子，责备你的门徒吧！”
{Luk 19:40} He answered, "I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out."
{Luk 19:40} 耶稣说：“我告诉你们，若是他们闭口不说，这些石头必要呼叫起来。”
{Luk 19:41} And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it,
{Luk 19:41} 耶稣快到耶路撒冷，看见城，就为他哀哭，
{Luk 19:42} saying, "Would [v.] that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.
{Luk 19:42} 说：“巴不得你在这日子知道关系你平安的事；无奈这事现在是隐藏的，叫你的眼看不出来。
{Luk 19:43} For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will set up a barricade /bxri'kAd/[路障] around you and surround you and hem [禁闭 包围 < 清嗓子拟音] you in on every side
{Luk 19:43} 因为日子将到，你的仇敌必筑起土垒，周围环绕你，四面困住你，
{Luk 19:44} and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation." /vizi'tASCn/[探望]
{Luk 19:44} 并要扫灭你和你里头的儿女，连一块石头也不留在石头上，因你不知道眷顾你的时候。”
{Luk 19:45} And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,
{Luk 19:45} 耶稣进了殿，赶出里头作买卖的人，
{Luk 19:46} saying to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den [兽穴] of robbers."
{Luk 19:46} 对他们说：“经上说：我的殿必作祷告的殿，你们倒使他成为贼窝了。”
{Luk 19:47} And he was teaching daily /dAly/ in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the principal [首者] men of the people were seeking to destroy him,
{Luk 19:47} 耶稣天天在殿里教训人。祭司长和文士与百姓的尊长都想要杀他，
{Luk 19:48} but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people were hanging /hxN/[悬挂] on his words.
{Luk 19:48} 但寻不出法子来，因为百姓都侧耳听他。
{Luk 20:1}  One day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up
{Luk 20:1}  有一天，耶稣在殿里教训百姓，讲福音的时候，祭司长和文士并长老上前来，
{Luk 20:2}  and said to him, "Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who it is that gave you this authority."
{Luk 20:2}  问他说：“你告诉我们，你仗着什么权柄做这些事？给你这权柄的是谁呢？”
{Luk 20:3}  He answered them, "I also will ask you a question. /kwestSCn/ Now tell me,
{Luk 20:3}  耶稣回答说：“我也要问你们一句话，你们且告诉我。
{Luk 20:4}  was the baptism of John from heaven or from man?"
{Luk 20:4}  约翰的洗礼是从天上来的？是从人间来的呢？”
{Luk 20:5}  And they discussed /dis'kCs/ it with one another, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'
{Luk 20:5}  他们彼此商议说：“我们若说‘从天上来’，他必说：‘你们为什么不信他呢？’
{Luk 20:6}  But if we say, 'From man,' all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced [完全征服 > 说服 使相信] that John was a prophet."
{Luk 20:6}  若说‘从人间来’，百姓都要用石头打死我们，因为他们信约翰是先知。”
{Luk 20:7}  So they answered that they did not know where it came from.
{Luk 20:7}  于是回答说：“不知道是从那里来的。”
{Luk 20:8}  And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
{Luk 20:8}  耶稣说：“我也不告诉你们，我仗着什么权柄做这些事。”
{Luk 20:9}  And he began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants [租客] and went into another country for a long while.
{Luk 20:9}  耶稣就设比喻对百姓说：“有人栽了一个葡萄园，租给园户，就往外国去住了许久。
{Luk 20:10} When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
{Luk 20:10} 到了时候，打发一个仆人到园户那里去，叫他们把园中当纳的果子交给他；园户竟打了他，叫他空手回去。
{Luk 20:11} And he sent another servant. But they also beat and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
{Luk 20:11} 又打发一个仆人去，他们也打了他，并且凌辱他，叫他空手回去。
{Luk 20:12} And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded /waund/[伤害] and cast out.
{Luk 20:12} 又打发第三个仆人去，他们也打伤了他，把他推出去了。
{Luk 20:13} Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps /pcr'hxps/[也许] they will respect him.'
{Luk 20:13} 园主说：‘我怎么办呢？我要打发我的爱子去，或者他们尊敬他。’
{Luk 20:14} But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir. /Ar/ Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'
{Luk 20:14} 不料，园户看见他，就彼此商量说：‘这是承受产业的，我们杀他吧，使产业归于我们！’
{Luk 20:15} And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
{Luk 20:15} 于是把他推出葡萄园外，杀了。这样，葡萄园的主人要怎样处治他们呢？
{Luk 20:16} He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others." When they heard this, they said, "Surely /Swr/ not!"
{Luk 20:16} 他要来除灭这些园户，将葡萄园转给别人。”听见的人说：“这是万不可的！”
{Luk 20:17} But he looked directly /di'rekt/[直] at them and said, "What then is this that is written: "'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'?
{Luk 20:17} 耶稣看着他们说：“经上记着：匠人所弃的石头已作了房角的头块石头。这是什么意思呢？
{Luk 20:18} Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush /krcS/[压碎声拟音] him."
{Luk 20:18} 凡掉在那石头上的，必要跌碎；那石头掉在谁的身上，就要把谁砸得稀烂。”
{Luk 20:19} The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people.
{Luk 20:19} 文士和祭司长看出这比喻是指着他们说的，当时就想要下手拿他，只是惧怕百姓。
{Luk 20:20} So they watched him and sent spies, /spI/ who pretended /prE'tend/[假装] to be sincere, /sin'sEr/[真诚] that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction /dZUris'dikSCn/[政权] of the governor. /govcrncr/
{Luk 20:20} 于是窥探耶稣，打发奸细装作好人，要在他的话上得把柄，好将他交在巡抚的政权之下。
{Luk 20:21} So they asked him, "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, /parS'xlity/[偏心] but truly teach the way of God.
{Luk 20:21} 奸细就问耶稣说：“夫子，我们晓得你所讲所传都是正道，也不取人的外貌，乃是诚诚实实传神的道。
{Luk 20:22} Is it lawful for us to give tribute /tribUt/[贡物] to Caesar, or not?"
{Luk 20:22} 我们纳税给该撒，可以不可以？”
{Luk 20:23} But he perceived their craftiness, /krxfty/[诡诈] and said to them,
{Luk 20:23} 耶稣看出他们的诡诈，就对他们说：
{Luk 20:24} "Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription /in'skripSCn/[里面的字 > 碑文] does it have?" They said, "Caesar's."
{Luk 20:24} “拿一个银钱来给我看。这像和这号是谁的？”他们说：“是该撒的。”
{Luk 20:25} He said to them, "Then render [归给] to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
{Luk 20:25} 耶稣说：“这样，该撒的物当归给该撒，神的物当归给神。”
{Luk 20:26} And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent.
{Luk 20:26} 他们当着百姓，在这话上得不着把柄，又希奇他的应对，就闭口无言了。
{Luk 20:27} There came to him some Sadducees, /sxdusE/ those who deny that there is a resurrection,
{Luk 20:27} 撒都该人常说没有复活的事。有几个来问耶稣说：
{Luk 20:28} and they asked him a question, saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, (that) the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
{Luk 20:28} “夫子！摩西为我们写着说：‘人若有妻无子就死了，他兄弟当娶他的妻，为哥哥生子立后。’
{Luk 20:29} Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children.
{Luk 20:29} 有弟兄七人，第一个娶了妻，没有孩子死了；
{Luk 20:30} And the second
{Luk 20:30} 第二个、第三个也娶过他；
{Luk 20:31} and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died.
{Luk 20:31} 那七个人都娶过他，没有留下孩子就死了。
{Luk 20:32} Afterward the woman also died.
{Luk 20:32} 后来妇人也死了。
{Luk 20:33} In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife."
{Luk 20:33} 这样，当复活的时候，他是那一个的妻子呢？因为他们七个人都娶过他。”
{Luk 20:34} And Jesus said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,
{Luk 20:34} 耶稣说：“这世界的人有娶有嫁；
{Luk 20:35} but those who are considered worthy to attain /a'tAn/[t伸出t触到 > 达到] to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,
{Luk 20:35} 惟有算为配得那世界，与从死里复活的人也不娶也不嫁；
{Luk 20:36} for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
{Luk 20:36} 因为他们不能再死，和天使一样；既是复活的人，就为神的儿子。
{Luk 20:37} But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage[一篇文章] about the bush, /buS/ where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
{Luk 20:37} 至于死人复活，摩西在荆棘篇上，称主是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神，就指示明白了。
{Luk 20:38} Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him."
{Luk 20:38} 神原不是死人的神，乃是活人的神；因为在他那里（那里：或作看来），人都是活的。”
{Luk 20:39} Then some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you have spoken well."
{Luk 20:39} 有几个文士说：“夫子！你说得好。”
{Luk 20:40} For they no longer dared to ask him any question.
{Luk 20:40} 以后他们不敢再问他什么。
{Luk 20:41} But he said to them, "How can they say that the Christ is David's son?
{Luk 20:41} 耶稣对他们说：“人怎么说基督是大卫的子孙呢？
{Luk 20:42} For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, /sam/ "'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
{Luk 20:42} 诗篇上大卫自己说：主对我主说：你坐在我的右边，
{Luk 20:43} until I make your enemies your footstool."'
{Luk 20:43} 等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。
{Luk 20:44} David thus calls him Lord, so how is he his son?"
{Luk 20:44} 大卫既称他为主，他怎么又是大卫的子孙呢？”
{Luk 20:45} And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,
{Luk 20:45} 众百姓听的时候，耶稣对门徒说：
{Luk 20:46} "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,
{Luk 20:46} “你们要防备文士。他们好穿长衣游行，喜爱人在街市上问他们安，又喜爱会堂里的高位，筵席上的首座；
{Luk 20:47} who devour widows' houses and for a pretense /prE'tens/[假意] make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation."
{Luk 20:47} 他们侵吞寡妇的家产，假意作很长的祷告。这些人要受更重的刑罚！”
{Luk 21:1}  Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box,
{Luk 21:1}  耶稣抬头观看，见财主把捐项投在库里，
{Luk 21:2}  and he saw a poor widow put [VED] in two small copper coins.
{Luk 21:2}  又见一个穷寡妇投了两个小钱，
{Luk 21:3}  And he said, "Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them.
{Luk 21:3}  就说：“我实在告诉你们，这穷寡妇所投的比众人还多；
{Luk 21:4}  For they all contributed /kCn'tribUt/[共同给予 > 捐助] out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty /povcrty/[贫困] put in all she had to live on."
{Luk 21:4}  因为众人都是自己有余，拿出来投在捐项里，但这寡妇是自己不足，把他一切养生的都投上了。”
{Luk 21:5}  And while some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned /a'dorn/[妆饰] with noble stones and offerings, he said,
{Luk 21:5}  有人谈论圣殿是用美石和供物妆饰的；
{Luk 21:6}  "As for [phr.至于] these things that you see, the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down."
{Luk 21:6}  耶稣就说：“论到你们所看见的这一切，将来日子到了，在这里没有一块石头留在石头上，不被拆毁了。”
{Luk 21:7}  And they asked him, "Teacher, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?"
{Luk 21:7}  他们问他说：“夫子！什么时候有这事呢？这事将到的时候有什么预兆呢？”
{Luk 21:8}  And he said, "See that you are not led astray. /a'strA/[迷途] For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and, 'The time is at hand!' Do not go after them.
{Luk 21:8}  耶稣说：“你们要谨慎，不要受迷惑；因为将来有好些人冒我的名来，说：‘我是基督，’又说：‘时候近了’，你们不要跟从他们！
{Luk 21:9}  And when you hear of wars and tumults, /tumClt/[骚乱] do not be terrified, /terifI/ for these things must first take place, but the end will not be at once."
{Luk 21:9}  你们听见打仗和扰乱的事，不要惊惶；因为这些事必须先有，只是末期不能立时就到。
{Luk 21:10} Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
{Luk 21:10} 当时，耶稣对他们说：“民要攻打民，国要攻打国；
{Luk 21:11} There will be great earthquakes, /crthkwAk/ and in various /vxrics/ places famines and pestilences. /pestilens/ And there will be terrors /tercr/ and great signs from heaven.
{Luk 21:11} 地要大大震动，多处必有饥荒、瘟疫，又有可怕的异象和大神迹从天上显现。
{Luk 21:12} But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake.
{Luk 21:12} 但这一切的事以先，人要下手拿住你们，逼迫你们，把你们交给会堂，并且收在监里，又为我的名拉你们到君王诸侯面前。
{Luk 21:13} This will be your opportunity /opcr'tunity/ to bear witness.
{Luk 21:13} 但这些事终必为你们的见证。
{Luk 21:14} Settle [立定] it therefore in your minds not to meditate /meditAt/[熟思] beforehand [预先] how to answer,
{Luk 21:14} 所以，你们当立定心意，不要预先思想怎样分诉；
{Luk 21:15} for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand [抵抗] or contradict. /kCntra'dikt/[反驳]
{Luk 21:15} 因为我必赐你们口才、智慧，是你们一切敌人所敌不住、驳不倒的。
{Luk 21:16} You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death.
{Luk 21:16} 连你们的父母、弟兄、亲族、朋友也要把你们交官；你们也有被他们害死的。
{Luk 21:17} You will be hated by all for my name's sake.
{Luk 21:17} 你们要为我的名被众人恨恶，
{Luk 21:18} But not a hair of your head will perish.
{Luk 21:18} 然而，你们连一根头发也必不损坏。
{Luk 21:19} By your endurance /en'durans/ you will gain your lives.
{Luk 21:19} 你们常存忍耐，就必保全灵魂（或作：必得生命）。”
{Luk 21:20} "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, [军队] then know that its desolation /desO'lASCn/ has come near.
{Luk 21:20} “你们看见耶路撒冷被兵围困，就可知道他成荒场的日子近了。
{Luk 21:21} Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it,
{Luk 21:21} 那时，在犹太的应当逃到山上；在城里的应当出来；在乡下的不要进城；
{Luk 21:22} for these are days of vengeance, /vendZans/[复仇] to fulfill all that is written.
{Luk 21:22} 因为这是报应的日子，使经上所写的都得应验。
{Luk 21:23} Alas /a'lxs/[哎呀] for women who are pregnant /pregnant/ and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress /di'stres/[不幸] upon the earth and wrath against this people.
{Luk 21:23} 当那些日子，怀孕的和奶孩子的有祸了！因为将有大灾难降在这地方，也有震怒临到这百姓。
{Luk 21:24} They will fall by the edge of the sword /sord/ and be led captive [俘虏] among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
{Luk 21:24} 他们要倒在刀下，又被掳到各国去。耶路撒冷要被外邦人践踏，直到外邦人的日期满了。”
{Luk 21:25} "And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity /pcr'pleksity/[困惑 困苦] because of the roaring /ror/[咆哮] of the sea and the waves, /wAv/
{Luk 21:25} “日、月、星辰要显出异兆，地上的邦国也有困苦；因海中波浪的响声，就慌慌不定。
{Luk 21:26} people fainting /fAnt/[昏晕] with fear and with foreboding /for'bOd/[预感] of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken. /SAk/
{Luk 21:26} 天势都要震动，人想起那将要临到世界的事，就都吓得魂不附体。
{Luk 21:27} And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
{Luk 21:27} 那时，他们要看见人子有能力，有大荣耀驾云降临。
{Luk 21:28} Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise /rAs/ your heads, because your redemption /re'dempSCn/[得赎] is drawing near."
{Luk 21:28} 一有这些事，你们就当挺身昂首，因为你们得赎的日子近了。”
{Luk 21:29} And he told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.
{Luk 21:29} 耶稣又设比喻对他们说：“你们看无花果树和各样的树；他发芽的时候，你们一看见，自然晓得夏天近了。
{Luk 21:30} As soon as they come out in leaf, /lEf/ you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near.
{Luk 21:30} (SEE 21:29)
{Luk 21:31} So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near.
{Luk 21:31} 这样，你们看见这些事渐渐的成就，也该晓得神的国近了。
{Luk 21:32} Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place.
{Luk 21:32} 我实在告诉你们，这世代还没有过去，这些事都要成就。
{Luk 21:33} Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
{Luk 21:33} 天地要废去，我的话却不能废去。”
{Luk 21:34} "But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed /wA/[称重] down with dissipation /disi'pASCn/[消沉] and drunkenness /drCnken/[醉态] and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap. /trxp/
{Luk 21:34} “你们要谨慎，恐怕因贪食、醉酒，并今生的思虑累住你们的心，那日子就如同网罗忽然临到你们；
{Luk 21:35} For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth.
{Luk 21:35} 因为那日子要这样临到全地上一切居住的人。
{Luk 21:36} But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape /es'kAp/ all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."
{Luk 21:36} 你们要时时警醒，常常祈求，使你们能逃避这一切要来的事，得以站立在人子面前。”
{Luk 21:37} And every day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out and lodged /lodZ/[小屋] on the mount called Olivet. /olivet/
{Luk 21:37} 耶稣每日在殿里教训人，每夜出城在一座山，名叫橄榄山住宿。
{Luk 21:38} And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him.
{Luk 21:38} 众百姓清早上圣殿，到耶稣那里，要听他讲道。
{Luk 22:1}  Now the Feast of Unleavened /leven/ Bread drew near, which is called the Passover.
{Luk 22:1}  除酵节（又叫逾越节）近了。
{Luk 22:2}  And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death, for they feared the people.
{Luk 22:2}  祭司长和文士想法子怎么才能杀害耶稣，是因他们惧怕百姓。
{Luk 22:3}  Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.
{Luk 22:3}  这时，撒但入了那称为加略人犹大的心；他本是十二门徒里的一个。
{Luk 22:4}  He went away and conferred /kCn'fcr/[商讨] with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them.
{Luk 22:4}  他去和祭司长并守殿官商量，怎么可以把耶稣交给他们。
{Luk 22:5}  And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.
{Luk 22:5}  他们欢喜，就约定给他银子。
{Luk 22:6}  So he consented /kCn'sent/[赞成] and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence /xbsens/[不在场] of a crowd.
{Luk 22:6}  他应允了，就找机会，要趁众人不在跟前的时候把耶稣交给他们。
{Luk 22:7}  Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb /lxm/[小羊羔] had to be sacrificed.
{Luk 22:7}  除酵节，须宰逾越羊羔的那一天到了。
{Luk 22:8}  So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it."
{Luk 22:8}  耶稣打发彼得、约翰，说：“你们去为我们预备逾越节的筵席，好叫我们吃。”
{Luk 22:9}  They said to him, "Where will you have us prepare it?"
{Luk 22:9}  他们问他说：“要我们在那里预备？”
{Luk 22:10} He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters
{Luk 22:10} 耶稣说：“你们进了城，必有人拿着一瓶水迎面而来，你们就跟着他，到他所进的房子里去，
{Luk 22:11} and tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
{Luk 22:11} 对那家的主人说：‘夫子说：客房在那里？我与门徒好在那里吃逾越节的筵席。’
{Luk 22:12} And he will show you a large upper room furnished; /fcrniS/[装备] prepare it there."
{Luk 22:12} 他必指给你们摆设整齐的一间大楼，你们就在那里预备。”
{Luk 22:13} And they went and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
{Luk 22:13} 他们去了，所遇见的正如耶稣所说的；他们就预备了逾越节的筵席。
{Luk 22:14} And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with him.
{Luk 22:14} 时候到了，耶稣坐席，使徒也和他同坐。
{Luk 22:15} And he said to them, "I have earnestly /crnest/[诚挚] desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
{Luk 22:15} 耶稣对他们说：“我很愿意在受害以先和你们吃这逾越节的筵席。
{Luk 22:16} For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
{Luk 22:16} 我告诉你们，我不再吃这筵席，直到成就在神的国里。”
{Luk 22:17} And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves.
{Luk 22:17} 耶稣接过杯来，祝谢了，说：“你们拿这个，大家分着喝。
{Luk 22:18} For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine /vIn/[藤 蔓] until the kingdom of God comes."
{Luk 22:18} 我告诉你们，从今以后，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直等神的国来到。”
{Luk 22:19} And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
{Luk 22:19} 又拿起饼来，祝谢了，就擘开，递给他们，说：“这是我的身体，为你们舍的，你们也应当如此行，为的是记念我。”
{Luk 22:20} And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant /kovenant/[契约] in my blood.
{Luk 22:20} 饭后也照样拿起杯来，说：“这杯是用我血所立的新约，是为你们流出来的。
{Luk 22:21} But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.
{Luk 22:21} 看哪！那卖我之人的手与我一同在桌子上。
{Luk 22:22} For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, /dE'tcrmin/[裁定] but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!"
{Luk 22:22} 人子固然要照所预定的去世，但卖人子的人有祸了！”
{Luk 22:23} And they began to question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this.
{Luk 22:23} 他们就彼此对问，是哪一个要做这事。
{Luk 22:24} A dispute /di'spUt/[争论] also arose among them, as to which of them was to be regarded /rE'gard/[尊作] as the greatest.
{Luk 22:24} 门徒起了争论，他们中间哪一个可算为大。
{Luk 22:25} And he said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles exercise /ekscrsIs/[操练] lordship [君主者] over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors. /benefxktcr/[恩人]
{Luk 22:25} 耶稣说：“外邦人有君王为主治理他们，那掌权管他们的称为恩主。
{Luk 22:26} But not so with you. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.
{Luk 22:26} 但你们不可这样；你们里头为大的，倒要像年幼的；为首领的，倒要像服事人的。
{Luk 22:27} For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am among you as the one who serves.
{Luk 22:27} 是谁为大？是坐席的呢？是服事人的呢？不是坐席的大吗？然而，我在你们中间如同服事人的。
{Luk 22:28} "You are those who have stayed with me in my trials, /trIal/
{Luk 22:28} 我在磨炼之中，常和我同在的就是你们。
{Luk 22:29} and I assign /a'sIn/[指派] to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom,
{Luk 22:29} 我将国赐给你们，正如我父赐给我一样，
{Luk 22:30} that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones /thrOn/ judging the twelve tribes /trIb/[部落] of Israel.
{Luk 22:30} 叫你们在我国里，坐在我的席上吃喝，并且坐在宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。”
{Luk 22:31} "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded /dE'mxnd/[要求] to have you, that he might sift [筛] you like wheat,
{Luk 22:31} 主又说：“西门！西门！撒但想要得着你们，好筛你们像筛麦子一样；
{Luk 22:32} but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen /strengthen/[加强 坚固] your brothers."
{Luk 22:32} 但我已经为你祈求，叫你不至于失了信心，你回头以后，要坚固你的弟兄。”
{Luk 22:33} Peter said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death."
{Luk 22:33} 彼得说：“主啊，我就是同你下监，同你受死，也是甘心！”
{Luk 22:34} Jesus said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster /rwstcr/[公鸡] will not crow /krO/[鸡叫声] this day, until you deny /dE'nI/ three times that you know me."
{Luk 22:34} 耶稣说：“彼得，我告诉你，今日鸡还没有叫，你要三次说不认得我。”
{Luk 22:35} And he said to them, "When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack /nxpsxk/[背包] or sandals, did you lack /lxk/ anything?" They said, "Nothing."
{Luk 22:35} 耶稣又对他们说：“我差你们出去的时候，没有钱囊，没有口袋，没有鞋，你们缺少什么没有？”他们说：“没有。”
{Luk 22:36} He said to them, "But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak /klOk/[斗篷 < 大钟状] and buy one.
{Luk 22:36} 耶稣说：“但如今有钱囊的可以带着，有口袋的也可以带着，没有刀的要卖衣服买刀。
{Luk 22:37} For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors.' /trxns'grescr/[罪犯] For what is written about me has its fulfillment." [phr.成就了]
{Luk 22:37} 我告诉你们，经上写着说：‘他被列在罪犯之中。’这话必应验在我身上；因为那关系我的事必然成就。”
{Luk 22:38} And they said, "Look, Lord, here are two swords." And he said to them, "It is enough."
{Luk 22:38} 他们说：“主啊，请看！这里有两把刀。”耶稣说：“够了。”
{Luk 22:39} And he came out and went, as [conj.] was his custom, [as his custom was] to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.
{Luk 22:39} 耶稣出来，照常往橄榄山去，门徒也跟随他。
{Luk 22:40} And when he came to the place, he said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."
{Luk 22:40} 到了那地方，就对他们说：“你们要祷告，免得入了迷惑。”
{Luk 22:41} And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt /nelt/ down and prayed,
{Luk 22:41} 于是离开他们约有扔一块石头那么远，跪下祷告，
{Luk 22:42} saying, "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."
{Luk 22:42} 说：“父啊！你若愿意，就把这杯撤去；然而，不要成就我的意思，只要成就你的意思。”
{Luk 22:43} And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
{Luk 22:43} 有一位天使从天上显现，加添他的力量。
{Luk 22:44} And being in agony /xgCny/[极大痛苦] he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat /swet/[汗] became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
{Luk 22:44} 耶稣极其伤痛，祷告更加恳切，汗珠如大血点滴在地上。
{Luk 22:45} And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow, /sorO/[忧伤]
{Luk 22:45} 祷告完了，就起来，到门徒那里，见他们因为忧愁都睡着了，
{Luk 22:46} and he said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."
{Luk 22:46} 就对他们说：“你们为什么睡觉呢？起来祷告，免得入了迷惑！”
{Luk 22:47} While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him,
{Luk 22:47} 说话之间，来了许多人。那十二个门徒里名叫犹大的，走在前头，就近耶稣，要与他亲嘴。
{Luk 22:48} but Jesus said to him, "Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"
{Luk 22:48} 耶稣对他说：“犹大！你用亲嘴的暗号卖人子吗？”
{Luk 22:49} And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said, "Lord, shall we strike /strIk/[欧打] with the sword?"
{Luk 22:49} 左右的人见光景不好，就说：“主啊！我们拿刀砍可以不可以？”
{Luk 22:50} And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
{Luk 22:50} 内中有一个人把大祭司的仆人砍了一刀，削掉了他的右耳。
{Luk 22:51} But Jesus said, "No more of this!" And he touched his ear and healed him.
{Luk 22:51} 耶稣说：“到了这个地步，由他们吧！”就摸那人的耳朵，把他治好了。
{Luk 22:52} Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? /klCb/[木棍]
{Luk 22:52} 耶稣对那些来拿他的祭司长和守殿官并长老说：“你们带着刀棒出来拿我，如同拿强盗吗？
{Luk 22:53} When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
{Luk 22:53} 我天天同你们在殿里，你们不下手拿我。现在却是你们的时候，黑暗掌权了。”
{Luk 22:54} Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house, and Peter was following at a distance. [远距离]
{Luk 22:54} 他们拿住耶稣，把他带到大祭司的宅里。彼得远远的跟着。
{Luk 22:55} And when they had kindled /kindl/ a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.
{Luk 22:55} 他们在院子里生了火，一同坐着；彼得也坐在他们中间。
{Luk 22:56} Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, "This man also was with him."
{Luk 22:56} 有一个使女看见彼得坐在火光里，就定睛看他，说：“这个人素来也是同那人一夥的。”
{Luk 22:57} But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."
{Luk 22:57} 彼得却不承认，说：“女子，我不认得他。”
{Luk 22:58} And a little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."
{Luk 22:58} 过了不多的时候，又有一个人看见他，说：“你也是他们一党的。”彼得说：“你这个人！我不是。”
{Luk 22:59} And after an interval /intcrval/[间隔] of about an hour still another insisted, /in'sist/[坚决] saying, "Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean."
{Luk 22:59} 约过了一小时，又有一个人极力的说：“他实在是同那人一夥的，因为他也是加利利人。”
{Luk 22:60} But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about." And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
{Luk 22:60} 彼得说：“你这个人！我不晓得你说的是什么！”正说话之间，鸡就叫了。
{Luk 22:61} And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times."
{Luk 22:61} 主转过身来看彼得。彼得便想起主对他所说的话：“今日鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。”
{Luk 22:62} And he went out and wept bitterly.
{Luk 22:62} 他就出去痛哭。
{Luk 22:63} Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody /kcstcdy/[监禁处] were mocking him as they beat him.
{Luk 22:63} 看守耶稣的人戏弄他，打他，
{Luk 22:64} They also blindfolded /blIndfOld/ him and kept asking him, "Prophesy! /profEsI/[预告] Who is it that struck you?"
{Luk 22:64} 又蒙着他的眼，问他说：“你是先知，告诉我们打你的是谁？”
{Luk 22:65} And they said many other things against him, blaspheming /blxs'fEm/ him.
{Luk 22:65} 他们还用许多别的话辱骂他。
{Luk 22:66} When day came, the assembly /a'sembly/[集合] of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. And they led him away to their council, /kaunsil/[会议] and they said,
{Luk 22:66} 天一亮，民间的众长老连祭司长带文士都聚会，把耶稣带到他们的公会里，
{Luk 22:67} "If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe,
{Luk 22:67} 说：“你若是基督，就告诉我们。”耶稣说：“我若告诉你们，你们也不信；
{Luk 22:68} and if I ask you, you will not answer.
{Luk 22:68} 我若问你们，你们也不回答。
{Luk 22:69} But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God."
{Luk 22:69} 从今以后，人子要坐在神权能的右边。”
{Luk 22:70} So they all said, "Are you the Son of God, then?" And he said to them, "You say that I am."
{Luk 22:70} 他们都说：“这样，你是神的儿子吗？”耶稣说：“你们所说的是。”
{Luk 22:71} Then they said, "What further /fcrdhcr/ testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips."
{Luk 22:71} 他们说：“何必再用见证呢？他亲口所说的，我们都亲自听见了。”
{Luk 23:1}  Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate.
{Luk 23:1}  众人都起来，把耶稣解到彼拉多面前，
{Luk 23:2}  And they began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man misleading /mis'lEd/[误导] our nation and forbidding /for'bid/[禁止] us to give tribute [贡物] to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king."
{Luk 23:2}  就告他说：“我们见这人诱惑国民，禁止纳税给该撒，并说自己是基督，是王。”
{Luk 23:3}  And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him, "You have said so."
{Luk 23:3}  彼拉多问耶稣说：“你是犹太人的王吗？”耶稣回答说：“你说的是。”
{Luk 23:4}  Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no guilt in this man."
{Luk 23:4}  彼拉多对祭司长和众人说：“我查不出这人有什么罪来。”
{Luk 23:5}  But they were urgent, /crdZent/[急迫] saying, "He stirs /stcr/[搅动] up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place."
{Luk 23:5}  但他们越发极力的说：“他煽惑百姓，在犹太遍地传道，从加利利起，直到这里了。”
{Luk 23:6}  When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
{Luk 23:6}  彼拉多一听见，就问：“这人是加利利人吗？”
{Luk 23:7}  And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, /dZcris'dikSCn/[审判权] he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.
{Luk 23:7}  既晓得耶稣属希律所管，就把他送到希律那里去。那时希律正在耶路撒冷。
{Luk 23:8}  When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him.
{Luk 23:8}  希律看见耶稣，就很欢喜；因为听见过他的事，久已想要见他，并且指望看他行一件神迹。
{Luk 23:9}  So he questioned him at some length, [phr.相当长] but he made no answer. [phr.不回答]
{Luk 23:9}  于是问他许多的话；耶稣却一言不答。
{Luk 23:10} The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently /vEement/[把心移去 > 激烈] accusing him.
{Luk 23:10} 祭司长和文士都站着，极力的告他。
{Luk 23:11} And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt /kCn'tempt/ and mocked him. Then, arraying /arrA/[盛装] him in splendid [光亮] clothing, he sent him back to Pilate.
{Luk 23:11} 希律和他的兵丁就藐视耶稣，戏弄他，给他穿上华丽衣服，把他送回彼拉多那里去。
{Luk 23:12} And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other [phr.prep互相] that very day, for before this they had been at enmity /enmity/[敌意] with each other.
{Luk 23:12} 从前希律和彼拉多彼此有仇，在那一天就成了朋友。
{Luk 23:13} Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
{Luk 23:13} 彼拉多传齐了祭司长和官府并百姓，
{Luk 23:14} and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. And after examining /eksxmin/[细察] him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him.
{Luk 23:14} 就对他们说：“你们解这人到我这里，说他是诱惑百姓的。看哪，我也曾将你们告他的事，在你们面前审问他，并没有查出他什么罪来；
{Luk 23:15} Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving /dE'zcrv/ death has been done by him.
{Luk 23:15} 就是希律也是如此，所以把他送回来。可见他没有做什么该死的事。
{Luk 23:16} I will therefore punish /pCniS/[处罚] and release /rElEs/ him."
{Luk 23:16} 故此，我要责打他，把他释放了。”
{Luk 23:17} Now he was obliged to release one man to them at the festival.
{Luk 23:17} （有古卷加：每逢这节期，巡抚必须释放一个囚犯给他们。）
{Luk 23:18} But they all cried out together, "Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas"— /ba'rxbas/
{Luk 23:18} 众人却一齐喊着说：“除掉这个人！释放巴拉巴给我们！”
{Luk 23:19} a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection /inscr'rekSCn/[暴乱] started in the city and for murder.
{Luk 23:19} 这巴拉巴是因在城里作乱杀人，下在监里的。
{Luk 23:20} Pilate addressed [致词] them once more, [再一次] desiring to release Jesus,
{Luk 23:20} 彼拉多愿意释放耶稣，就又劝解他们。
{Luk 23:21} but they kept shouting, /Saut/ "Crucify, crucify him!"
{Luk 23:21} 无奈他们喊着说：“钉他十字架！钉他十字架！”
{Luk 23:22} A third time he said to them, "Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish and release him."
{Luk 23:22} 彼拉多第三次对他们说：“为什么呢？这人做了什么恶事呢？我并没有查出他什么该死的罪来。所以，我要责打他，把他释放了。”
{Luk 23:23} But they were urgent, demanding /dE'mxnd/[要求] with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. /prEvAl/[获胜]
{Luk 23:23} 他们大声催逼彼拉多，求他把耶稣钉在十字架上。他们的声音就得了胜。
{Luk 23:24} So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. /grxnt/[授权]
{Luk 23:24} 彼拉多这才照他们所求的定案，
{Luk 23:25} He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus over to their will.
{Luk 23:25} 把他们所求的那作乱杀人、下在监里的释放了，把耶稣交给他们，任凭他们的意思行。
{Luk 23:26} And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, /sIrEnE/ who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.
{Luk 23:26} 带耶稣去的时候，有一个古利奈人西门，从乡下来；他们就抓住他，把十字架搁在他身上，叫他背着跟随耶稣。
{Luk 23:27} And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting /la'ment/ for him.
{Luk 23:27} 有许多百姓跟随耶稣，内中有好些妇女；妇女们为他号啕痛哭。
{Luk 23:28} But turning to them Jesus said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
{Luk 23:28} 耶稣转身对他们说：“耶路撒冷的女子，不要为我哭，当为自己和自己的儿女哭。
{Luk 23:29} For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren /bxren/[不生育] and the wombs/wwm/ that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'
{Luk 23:29} 因为日子要到，人必说：‘不生育的，和未曾怀胎的，未曾乳养婴孩的，有福了！”
{Luk 23:30} Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.'
{Luk 23:30} 那时，人要向大山说：倒在我们身上！向小山说：遮盖我们！
{Luk 23:31} For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"
{Luk 23:31} “这些事既行在有汁水的树上，那枯干的树将来怎么样呢？”
{Luk 23:32} Two others, who were criminals, /criminal/[犯人] were led away to be put to death with him.
{Luk 23:32} 又有两个犯人，和耶稣一同带来处死。
{Luk 23:33} And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, /skcl/[头盖骨] there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
{Luk 23:33} 到了一个地方，名叫“髑髅地”，就在那里把耶稣钉在十字架上，又钉了两个犯人：一个在左边，一个在右边。
{Luk 23:34} And Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not [know not 不知道] what they do." And they cast lots to divide his garments.
{Luk 23:34} 当下耶稣说：“父啊！赦免他们；因为他们所做的，他们不晓得。”兵丁就拈阄分他的衣服。
{Luk 23:35} And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed /skof/[嗤笑] at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen /tSOsen/ One!"
{Luk 23:35} 百姓站在那里观看。官府也嗤笑他，说：“他救了别人；他若是基督，神所拣选的，可以救自己吧！”
{Luk 23:36} The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour /saur/ wine
{Luk 23:36} 兵丁也戏弄他，上前拿醋送给他喝，
{Luk 23:37} and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"
{Luk 23:37} 说：“你若是犹太人的王，可以救自己吧！”
{Luk 23:38} There was also an inscription over him, "This is the King of the Jews."
{Luk 23:38} 在耶稣以上有一个牌子（有古卷加：用希利尼、罗马、希伯来的文字）写着：“这是犹太人的王。”
{Luk 23:39} One of the criminals who were hanged railed /rAl/[杆 责骂] at him, saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!"
{Luk 23:39} 那同钉的两个犯人有一个讥诮他，说：“你不是基督吗？可以救自己和我们吧！”
{Luk 23:40} But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence /sentens/[句子 宣判 < 意见] of condemnation? /kCndem'nASCn/[刑罚]
{Luk 23:40} 那一个就应声责备他，说：“你既是一样受刑的，还不怕神吗？
{Luk 23:41} And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due /dU/[应得的] reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."
{Luk 23:41} 我们是应该的，因我们所受的与我们所做的相称，但这个人没有作过一件不好的事。”
{Luk 23:42} And he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
{Luk 23:42} 就说：“耶稣啊，你得国降临的时候，求你记念我！”
{Luk 23:43} And he said to him, "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise." /pxradIs/
{Luk 23:43} 耶稣对他说：“我实在告诉你，今日你要同我在乐园里了。”
{Luk 23:44} It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,
{Luk 23:44} 那时约有午正，遍地都黑暗了，直到申初，
{Luk 23:45} while the sun's light failed. And the curtain /kcrtan/[帷幕] of the temple was torn [tear] in two.
{Luk 23:45} 日头变黑了；殿里的幔子从当中裂为两半。
{Luk 23:46} Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit [交托] my spirit!" And having said this he breathed /brEdh/ his last.
{Luk 23:46} 耶稣大声喊着说：“父啊！我将我的灵魂交在你手里。”说了这话，气就断了。
{Luk 23:47} Now when the centurion /sen'tSUriCn/ saw what had taken place, he praised God, saying, "Certainly this man was innocent!" /incsent/[无罪]
{Luk 23:47} 百夫长看见所成的事，就归荣耀与神，说：“这真是个义人！”
{Luk 23:48} And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, /spektakl/[奇事] when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. /brest/
{Luk 23:48} 聚集观看的众人见了这所成的事都捶着胸回去了。
{Luk 23:49} And all his acquaintances /a'kwAntans/[熟人] and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.
{Luk 23:49} 还有一切与耶稣熟识的人，和从加利利跟着他来的妇女们，都远远的站着看这些事。
{Luk 23:50} Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish /dZUiS/ town of Arimathea. /arimathEa/ He was a member of the council, /kaunsil/[会议] a good and righteous man,
{Luk 23:50} 有一个人名叫约瑟，是个议士，为人善良公义；
{Luk 23:51} who had not consented /kCn'sent/[赞同] to their decision /dE'siZCn/[决定] and action; and he was looking for the kingdom of God.
{Luk 23:51} 众人所谋所为，他并没有附从。他本是犹太、亚利马太城里素常盼望神国的人。
{Luk 23:52} This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
{Luk 23:52} 这人去见彼拉多，求耶稣的身体，
{Luk 23:53} Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen /linen/[麻布] shroud /Sraud/[衣布] and laid him in a tomb /twm/ cut in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid.
{Luk 23:53} 就取下来，用细麻布裹好，安放在石头凿成的坟墓里；那里头从来没有葬过人。
{Luk 23:54} It was the day of Preparation, /prepa'rASCn/[准备] and the Sabbath was beginning.
{Luk 23:54} 那日是预备日，安息日也快到了。
{Luk 23:55} The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.
{Luk 23:55} 那些从加利利和耶稣同来的妇女跟在后面，看见了坟墓和他的身体怎样安放。
{Luk 23:56} Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
{Luk 23:56} 他们就回去，预备了香料香膏。他们在安息日，便遵着诫命安息了。
{Luk 24:1}  But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, /don/[黎明] they went to the tomb, taking the spices /spIs/[香料] they had prepared.
{Luk 24:1}  七日的头一日，黎明的时候，那些妇女带着所预备的香料来到坟墓前，
{Luk 24:2}  And they found the stone rolled /rOl/[卷 滚] away from the tomb,
{Luk 24:2}  看见石头已经从坟墓辊开了，
{Luk 24:3}  but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
{Luk 24:3}  他们就进去，只是不见主耶稣的身体。
{Luk 24:4}  While they were perplexed /pcr'pleks/[猜疑] about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling /dxzl/[耀眼] apparel. /a'pxrel/[衣着]
{Luk 24:4}  正在猜疑之间，忽然有两个人站在旁边，衣服放光。
{Luk 24:5}  And as they were frightened /frIten/[惊怕] and bowed /bau/[弯] their faces to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?
{Luk 24:5}  妇女们惊怕，将脸伏地。那两个人就对他们说：“为什么在死人中找活人呢？
{Luk 24:6}  He is not here, but has risen. /risen/ Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,
{Luk 24:6}  他不在这里，已经复活了。当记念他还在加利利的时候怎样告诉你们，
{Luk 24:7}  that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise."
{Luk 24:7}  说：‘人子必须被交在罪人手里，钉在十字架上，第三日复活。’”
{Luk 24:8}  And they remembered his words,
{Luk 24:8}  他们就想起耶稣的话来，
{Luk 24:9}  and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven /E'leven/ and to all the rest. [其余留下]
{Luk 24:9}  便从坟墓那里回去，把这一切事告诉十一个使徒和其余的人。
{Luk 24:10} Now it was Mary Magdalene /mxgdalEn/ and Joanna /dZO'xna/ and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles,
{Luk 24:10} 那告诉使徒的就是抹大拉的马利亚和约亚拿，并雅各的母亲马利亚，还有与他们在一处的妇女。
{Luk 24:11} but these words seemed to them an idle /Idl/[空洞无价值] tale, /tAl/[谣言] and they did not believe them.
{Luk 24:11} 他们这些话，使徒以为是胡言，就不相信。
{Luk 24:12} But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping /stwp/[弯腰] and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.
{Luk 24:12} 彼得起来，跑到坟墓前，低头往里看，见细麻布独在一处，就回去了，心里希奇所成的事。
{Luk 24:13} That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, /emACs/ about seven miles from Jerusalem,
{Luk 24:13} 正当那日，门徒中有两个人往一个村子去；这村子名叫以马忤斯，离耶路撒冷约有二十五里。
{Luk 24:14} and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.
{Luk 24:14} 他们彼此谈论所遇见的这一切事。
{Luk 24:15} While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.
{Luk 24:15} 正谈论相问的时候，耶稣亲自就近他们，和他们同行；
{Luk 24:16} But their eyes were kept from recognizing /rekCg,nIz/ him.
{Luk 24:16} 只是他们的眼睛迷糊了，不认识他。
{Luk 24:17} And he said to them, "What is this conversation /kCnvcr'sASCn/[会话] that you are holding [握住] with each other as you walk?" And they stood still, looking sad.
{Luk 24:17} 耶稣对他们说：“你们走路彼此谈论的是什么事呢？”他们就站住，脸上带着愁容。
{Luk 24:18} Then one of them, named Cleopas, /klECpas/ answered him, "Are you the only visitor [访客] to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"
{Luk 24:18} 二人中有一个名叫革流巴的回答说：“你在耶路撒冷作客，还不知道这几天在那里所出的事吗？”
{Luk 24:19} And he said to them, "What things?" And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,
{Luk 24:19} 耶稣说：“什么事呢？”他们说：“就是拿撒勒人耶稣的事。他是个先知，在神和众百姓面前，说话行事都有大能。
{Luk 24:20} and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
{Luk 24:20} 祭司长和我们的官府竟把他解去，定了死罪，钉在十字架上。
{Luk 24:21} But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem /rE'dEm/[赎回] Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.
{Luk 24:21} 但我们素来所盼望、要赎以色列民的就是他！不但如此，而且这事成就，现在已经三天了。
{Luk 24:22} Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning,
{Luk 24:22} 再者，我们中间有几个妇女使我们惊奇；他们清早到了坟墓那里，
{Luk 24:23} and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision /viZCn/[显现] of angels, who said that he was alive. /a'lIv/
{Luk 24:23} 不见他的身体，就回来告诉我们，说看见了天使显现，说他活了。
{Luk 24:24} Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see."
{Luk 24:24} 又有我们的几个人往坟墓那里去，所遇见的正如妇女们所说的，只是没有看见他。”
{Luk 24:25} And he said to them, "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
{Luk 24:25} 耶稣对他们说：“无知的人哪，先知所说的一切话，你们的心信得太迟钝了。
{Luk 24:26} Was it not necessary /nesesxry/[必需] that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?"
{Luk 24:26} 基督这样受害，又进入他的荣耀，岂不是应当的吗？”
{Luk 24:27} And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted /in'tcrpret/[诠释] to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
{Luk 24:27} 于是从摩西和众先知起，凡经上所指着自己的话都给他们讲解明白了。
{Luk 24:28} So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, /fardhcr/[更远]
{Luk 24:28} 将近他们所去的村子，耶稣好像还要往前行，
{Luk 24:29} but they urged /crdZ/[催促] him strongly, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent." [花费 花尽] So he went in to stay with them.
{Luk 24:29} 他们却强留他，说：“时候晚了，日头已经平西了，请你同我们住下吧！”耶稣就进去，要同他们住下。
{Luk 24:30} When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them.
{Luk 24:30} 到了坐席的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝谢了，擘开，递给他们。
{Luk 24:31} And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished /vxniS/[突然消失] from their sight.
{Luk 24:31} 他们的眼睛明亮了，这才认出他来。忽然耶稣不见了。
{Luk 24:32} They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?"
{Luk 24:32} 他们彼此说：“在路上，他和我们说话，给我们讲解圣经的时候，我们的心岂不是火热的吗？”
{Luk 24:33} And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,
{Luk 24:33} 他们就立时起身，回耶路撒冷去，正遇见十一个使徒和他们的同人聚集在一处，
{Luk 24:34} saying, "The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"
{Luk 24:34} 说：“主果然复活，已经现给西门看了。”
{Luk 24:35} Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.
{Luk 24:35} 两个人就把路上所遇见，和擘饼的时候怎么被他们认出来的事，都述说了一遍。
{Luk 24:36} As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, "Peace to you!"
{Luk 24:36} 正说这话的时候，耶稣亲自站在他们当中，说：“愿你们平安！”
{Luk 24:37} But they were startled /startl/[惊吓] and frightened and thought they saw a spirit.
{Luk 24:37} 他们却惊慌害怕，以为所看见的是魂。
{Luk 24:38} And he said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts /daut/[疑惑] arise in your hearts?
{Luk 24:38} 耶稣说：“你们为什么愁烦？为什么心里起疑念呢？
{Luk 24:39} See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have."
{Luk 24:39} 你们看我的手，我的脚，就知道实在是我了。摸我看看！魂无骨无肉，你们看，我是有的。”
{Luk 24:40} And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
{Luk 24:40} 说了这话，就把手和脚给他们看。
{Luk 24:41} And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"
{Luk 24:41} 他们正喜得不敢信，并且希奇；耶稣就说：“你们这里有什么吃的没有？”
{Luk 24:42} They gave him a piece of broiled /broil/[烧烤声拟音] fish,
{Luk 24:42} 他们便给他一片烧鱼。（有古卷加：和一块蜜房。）
