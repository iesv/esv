{Gen 1:1}   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
{Gen 1:1}   起初，神创造天地。
{Gen 1:2}   The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. [复数：水域]
{Gen 1:2}   地是空虚混沌，渊面黑暗；神的灵运行在水面上。
{Gen 1:3}   And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
{Gen 1:3}   神说：“要有光”，就有了光。
{Gen 1:4}   And God saw that the light was good. And God separated /separAt/ the light from the darkness.
{Gen 1:4}   神看光是好的，就把光暗分开了。
{Gen 1:5}   God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
{Gen 1:5}   神称光为“昼”，称暗为“夜”。有晚上，有早晨，这是头一日。
{Gen 1:6}   And God said, "Let there be an expanse /ek'spxns/ [宽阔区域] in the midst [当中] of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."
{Gen 1:6}   神说：“诸水之间要有空气，将水分为上下。”
{Gen 1:7}   And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.
{Gen 1:7}   神就造出空气，将空气以下的水、空气以上的水分开了。事就这样成了。
{Gen 1:8}   And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
{Gen 1:8}   神称空气为“天”。有晚上，有早晨，是第二日。
{Gen 1:9}   And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.
{Gen 1:9}   神说：“天下的水要聚在一处，使旱地露出来。”事就这样成了。
{Gen 1:10}  God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. [复数：海域] And God saw that it was good.
{Gen 1:10}  神称旱地为“地”，称水的聚处为“海”。神看着是好的。
{Gen 1:11}  And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding /yild/ [出产] seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth." And it was so.
{Gen 1:11}  神说：“地要发生青草和结种子的菜蔬，并结果子的树木，各从其类，果子都包着核。”事就这样成了。
{Gen 1:12}  The earth brought forth /brot/ [产生] [v-ed. bring] vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
{Gen 1:12}  于是地发生了青草和结种子的菜蔬，各从其类；并结果子的树木，各从其类；果子都包着核。神看着是好的。
{Gen 1:13}  And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
{Gen 1:13}  有晚上，有早晨，是第三日。
{Gen 1:14}  And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years,
{Gen 1:14}  神说：“天上要有光体，可以分昼夜，作记号，定节令、日子、年岁，
*
separate ... from ...
[把...和...分开, 把...和...区分开]
*
{Gen 1:15}  and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so.
{Gen 1:15}  并要发光在天空，普照在地上。”事就这样成了。
{Gen 1:16}  And God made the two great lights--the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night--and the stars.
{Gen 1:16}  于是神造了两个大光，大的管昼，小的管夜，又造众星，
{Gen 1:17}  And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,
{Gen 1:17}  就把这些光摆列在天空，普照在地上，
{Gen 1:18}  to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
{Gen 1:18}  管理昼夜，分别明暗。神看着是好的。
{Gen 1:19}  And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
{Gen 1:19}  有晚上，有早晨，是第四日。
{Gen 1:20}  And God said, "Let the waters swarm with [v-prep. 群集] swarms of living creatures, /crEtSjr/ [创造物] and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens."
{Gen 1:20}  神说：“水要多多滋生有生命的物；要有雀鸟飞在地面以上，天空之中。”
{Gen 1:21}  So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
{Gen 1:21}  神就造出大鱼和水中所滋生各样有生命的动物，各从其类；又造出各样飞鸟，各从其类。神看着是好的。
{Gen 1:22}  And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
{Gen 1:22}  神就赐福给这一切，说：“滋生繁多，充满海中的水；雀鸟也要多生在地上。”
{Gen 1:23}  And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
{Gen 1:23}  有晚上，有早晨，是第五日。
{Gen 1:24}  And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds--livestock and creeping things and beasts [兽] of the earth according to their kinds." And it was so.
{Gen 1:24}  神说：“地要生出活物来，各从其类；牲畜、昆虫、野兽，各从其类。”事就这样成了。
{Gen 1:25}  And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
{Gen 1:25}  于是神造出野兽，各从其类；牲畜，各从其类；地上一切昆虫，各从其类。神看着是好的。
{Gen 1:26}  Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion /dc'minicn/ [治理] over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
{Gen 1:26}  神说：“我们要照着我们的形像、按着我们的样式造人，使他们管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟、地上的牲畜，和全地，并地上所爬的一切昆虫。”
{Gen 1:27}  So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
{Gen 1:27}  神就照着自己的形像造人，乃是照着他的形像造男造女。
{Gen 1:28}  And God blessed them. And God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue /scb'du/ [使服从 » 征服 » 治理] it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
{Gen 1:28}  神就赐福给他们，又对他们说：“要生养众多，遍满地面，治理这地，也要管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟，和地上各样行动的活物。”
{Gen 1:29}  And God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food.
{Gen 1:29}  神说：“看哪，我将遍地上一切结种子的菜蔬和一切树上所结有核的果子全赐给你们作食物。
{Gen 1:30}  And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food." And it was so.
{Gen 1:30}  至于地上的走兽和空中的飞鸟，并各样爬在地上有生命的物，我将青草赐给他们作食物。”事就这样成了。
{Gen 1:31}  And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
{Gen 1:31}  神看着一切所造的都甚好。有晚上，有早晨，是第六日。
{Gen 2:1}   Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
{Gen 2:1}   天地万物都造齐了。
{Gen 2:2}   And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
{Gen 2:2}   到第七日，神造物的工已经完毕，就在第七日歇了他一切的工，安息了。
{Gen 2:3}   So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.
{Gen 2:3}   神赐福给第七日，定为圣日；因为在这日，神歇了他一切创造的工，就安息了。
{Gen 2:4}   These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
{Gen 2:4}   创造天地的来历，在耶和华神造天地的日子，乃是这样，
{Gen 2:5}   When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up--for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground,
{Gen 2:5}   野地还没有草木，田间的菜蔬还没有长起来；因为耶和华神还没有降雨在地上，也没有人耕地，
*
no...yet
没有……还
*
{Gen 2:6}   and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground--
{Gen 2:6}   但有雾气从地上腾，滋润遍地。
{Gen 2:7}   then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. /crEtScr/
{Gen 2:7}   耶和华神用地上的尘土造人，将生气吹在他鼻孔里，他就成了有灵的活人，名叫亚当。
{Gen 2:8}   And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
{Gen 2:8}   耶和华神在东方的伊甸立了一个园子，把所造的人安置在那里。
{Gen 2:9}   And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
{Gen 2:9}   耶和华神使各样的树从地里长出来，可以悦人的眼目，其上的果子好作食物。园子当中又有生命树和分别善恶的树。
{Gen 2:10}  A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.
{Gen 2:10}  有河从伊甸流出来，滋润那园子，从那里分为四道：
{Gen 2:11}  The name of the first is the Pishon. /piScn/ It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, /hxvila/ where there is gold.
{Gen 2:11}  第一道名叫比逊，就是环绕哈腓拉全地的。在那里有金子，
{Gen 2:12}  And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
{Gen 2:12}  并且那地的金子是好的；在那里又有珍珠和红玛瑙。
{Gen 2:13}  The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush.
{Gen 2:13}  第二道河名叫基训，就是环绕古实全地的。
{Gen 2:14}  And the name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
{Gen 2:14}  第三道河名叫希底结，流在亚述的东边。第四道河就是伯拉河。
{Gen 2:15}  The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
{Gen 2:15}  耶和华神将那人安置在伊甸园，使他修理，看守。
{Gen 2:16}  And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,
{Gen 2:16}  耶和华神吩咐他说：“园中各样树上的果子，你可以随意吃，
{Gen 2:17}  but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die."
{Gen 2:17}  只是分别善恶树上的果子，你不可吃，因为你吃的日子必定死！”
{Gen 2:18}  Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him."
{Gen 2:18}  耶和华神说：“那人独居不好，我要为他造一个配偶帮助他。”
{Gen 2:19}  Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
{Gen 2:19}  耶和华神用土所造成的野地各样走兽和空中各样飞鸟都带到那人面前，看他叫什么。那人怎样叫各样的活物，那就是他的名字。
{Gen 2:20}  The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him.
{Gen 2:20}  那人便给一切牲畜和空中飞鸟、野地走兽都起了名；只是那人没有遇见配偶帮助他。
{Gen 2:21}  So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
{Gen 2:21}  耶和华神使他沉睡，他就睡了；于是取下他的一条肋骨，又把肉合起来。
{Gen 2:22}  And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
{Gen 2:22}  耶和华神就用那人身上所取的肋骨造成一个女人，领他到那人跟前。
{Gen 2:23}  Then the man said, "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."
{Gen 2:23}  那人说：这是我骨中的骨，肉中的肉，可以称他为“女人”，因为他是从“男人”身上取出来的。
{Gen 2:24}  Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
{Gen 2:24}  因此，人要离开父母，与妻子连合，二人成为一体。
{Gen 2:25}  And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
{Gen 2:25}  当时夫妻二人赤身露体，并不羞耻。
{Gen 3:1}   Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'?"
{Gen 3:1}   耶和华神所造的，惟有蛇比田野一切的活物更狡猾。蛇对女人说：“神岂是真说不许你们吃园中所有树上的果子吗？”
{Gen 3:2}   And the woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,
{Gen 3:2}   女人对蛇说：“园中树上的果子，我们可以吃，
{Gen 3:3}   but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"
{Gen 3:3}   惟有园当中那棵树上的果子，神曾说：‘你们不可吃，也不可摸，免得你们死。’”
{Gen 3:4}   But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not surely die.
{Gen 3:4}   蛇对女人说：“你们不一定死；
{Gen 3:5}   For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
{Gen 3:5}   因为神知道，你们吃的日子眼睛就明亮了，你们便如神能知道善恶。”
{Gen 3:6}   So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired [可被请愿] to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.
{Gen 3:6}   于是女人见那棵树的果子好作食物，也悦人的眼目，且是可喜爱的，能使人有智慧，就摘下果子来吃了，又给他丈夫，他丈夫也吃了。
{Gen 3:7}   Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
{Gen 3:7}   他们二人的眼睛就明亮了，才知道自己是赤身露体，便拿无花果树的叶子为自己编做裙子。
{Gen 3:8}   And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
{Gen 3:8}   天起了凉风，耶和华神在园中行走。那人和他妻子听见神的声音，就藏在园里的树木中，躲避耶和华神的面。
{Gen 3:9}   But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?"
{Gen 3:9}   耶和华神呼唤那人，对他说：“你在那里？”
{Gen 3:10}  And he said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself."
{Gen 3:10}  他说：“我在园中听见你的声音，我就害怕；因为我赤身露体，我便藏了。”
{Gen 3:11}  He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
{Gen 3:11}  耶和华说：“谁告诉你赤身露体呢？莫非你吃了我吩咐你不可吃的那树上的果子吗？”
{Gen 3:12}  The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate."
{Gen 3:12}  那人说：“你所赐给我、与我同居的女人，他把那树上的果子给我，我就吃了。”
{Gen 3:13}  Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
{Gen 3:13}  耶和华神对女人说：“你做的是什么事呢？”女人说：“那蛇引诱我，我就吃了。”
{Gen 3:14}  The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
{Gen 3:14}  耶和华神对蛇说：你既做了这事，就必受咒诅，比一切的牲畜野兽更甚。你必用肚子行走，终身吃土。
{Gen 3:15}  I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."
{Gen 3:15}  我又要叫你和女人彼此为仇；你的后裔和女人的后裔也彼此为仇。女人的后裔要伤你的头；你要伤他的脚跟。
{Gen 3:16}  To the woman he said, "I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule over you."
{Gen 3:16}  又对女人说：我必多多加增你怀胎的苦楚；你生产儿女必多受苦楚。你必恋慕你丈夫；你丈夫必管辖你。
{Gen 3:17}  And to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
{Gen 3:17}  又对亚当说：你既听从妻子的话，吃了我所吩咐你不可吃的那树上的果子，地必为你的缘故受咒诅；你必终身劳苦才能从地里得吃的。
{Gen 3:18}  thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
{Gen 3:18}  地必给你长出荆棘和蒺藜来；你也要吃田间的菜蔬。
{Gen 3:19}  By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
{Gen 3:19}  你必汗流满面才得糊口，直到你归了土，因为你是从土而出的。你本是尘土，仍要归于尘土。
{Gen 3:20}  The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
{Gen 3:20}  亚当给他妻子起名叫夏娃，因为他是众生之母。
{Gen 3:21}  And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.
{Gen 3:21}  耶和华神为亚当和他妻子用皮子做衣服给他们穿。
{Gen 3:22}  Then the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever--"
{Gen 3:22}  耶和华神说：“那人已经与我们相似，能知道善恶；现在恐怕他伸手又摘生命树的果子吃，就永远活着。”
{Gen 3:23}  therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
{Gen 3:23}  耶和华神便打发他出伊甸园去，耕种他所自出之土。
{Gen 3:24}  He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.
{Gen 3:24}  于是把他赶出去了；又在伊甸园的东边安设基路伯和四面转动发火焰的剑，要把守生命树的道路。
{Gen 4:1}   Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, "I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD."
{Gen 4:1}   有一日，那人和他妻子夏娃同房，夏娃就怀孕，生了该隐（就是得的意思），便说：“耶和华使我得了一个男子。”
{Gen 4:2}   And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.
{Gen 4:2}   又生了该隐的兄弟亚伯。亚伯是牧羊的；该隐是种地的。
{Gen 4:3}   In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,
{Gen 4:3}   有一日，该隐拿地里的出产为供物献给耶和华；
{Gen 4:4}   and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. [部分] And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,
{Gen 4:4}   亚伯也将他羊群中头生的和羊的脂油献上。耶和华看中了亚伯和他的供物，
{Gen 4:5}   but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. [注重] So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.
{Gen 4:5}   只是看不中该隐和他的供物。该隐就大大的发怒，变了脸色。
{Gen 4:6}   The LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?
{Gen 4:6}   耶和华对该隐说：“你为什么发怒呢？你为什么变了脸色呢？
{Gen 4:7}   If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching /krautS/ [蹲伏] at the door. Its desire is contrary to you, but you must rule over it."
{Gen 4:7}   你若行得好，岂不蒙悦纳？你若行得不好，罪就伏在门前。他必恋慕你，你却要制伏他。”
{Gen 4:8}   Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.
{Gen 4:8}   该隐与他兄弟亚伯说话；二人正在田间。该隐起来打他兄弟亚伯，把他杀了。
{Gen 4:9}   Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" He said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"
{Gen 4:9}   耶和华对该隐说：“你兄弟亚伯在那里？”他说：“我不知道！我岂是看守我兄弟的吗？”
{Gen 4:10}  And the LORD said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.
{Gen 4:10}  耶和华说：“你做了什么事呢？你兄弟的血有声音从地里向我哀告。
{Gen 4:11}  And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
{Gen 4:11}  地开了口，从你手里接受你兄弟的血。现在你必从这地受咒诅。
{Gen 4:12}  When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."
{Gen 4:12}  你种地，地不再给你效力；你必流离飘荡在地上。”
{Gen 4:13}  Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.
{Gen 4:13}  该隐对耶和华说：“我的刑罚太重，过于我所能当的。
{Gen 4:14}  Behold, you have driven me today away from [prep.phr. 远离] the ground, and from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive /fUdZitiv/ [逃亡者] and a wanderer [流浪者] on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
{Gen 4:14}  你如今赶逐我离开这地，以致不见你面；我必流离飘荡在地上，凡遇见我的必杀我。”
{Gen 4:15}  Then the LORD said to him, "Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance /vendZens/ [复仇] shall be taken on him sevenfold." And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack /at'txk/ him.
{Gen 4:15}  耶和华对他说：“凡杀该隐的，必遭报七倍。”耶和华就给该隐立一个记号，免得人遇见他就杀他。
{Gen 4:16}  Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD and settled [安置 安顿] in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
{Gen 4:16}  于是该隐离开耶和华的面，去住在伊甸东边挪得之地。
{Gen 4:17}  Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
{Gen 4:17}  该隐与妻子同房，他妻子就怀孕，生了以诺。该隐建造了一座城，就按着他儿子的名将那城叫做以诺。
{Gen 4:18}  To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.
{Gen 4:18}  以诺生以拿；以拿生米户雅利；米户雅利生玛土撒利；玛土撒利生拉麦。
{Gen 4:19}  And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
{Gen 4:19}  拉麦娶了两个妻：一个名叫亚大，一个名叫洗拉。
{Gen 4:20}  Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
{Gen 4:20}  亚大生雅八；雅八就是住帐棚、牧养牲畜之人的祖师。
{Gen 4:21}  His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
{Gen 4:21}  雅八的兄弟名叫犹八；他是一切弹琴吹箫之人的祖师。
{Gen 4:22}  Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

{Gen 6:15}  This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
{Gen 6:15}  方舟的造法乃是这样：要长三百肘，宽五十肘，高三十肘。

{Gen 6:22}  Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.
{Gen 6:22}  挪亚就这样行。凡神所吩咐的，他都照样行了。
{Gen 7:1}   Then the LORD said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation.
{Gen 7:1}   耶和华对挪亚说：“你和你的全家都要进入方舟；因为在这世代中，我见你在我面前是义人。
{Gen 7:2}   Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate,
{Gen 7:2}   凡洁净的畜类，你要带七公七母；不洁净的畜类，你要带一公一母；
{Gen 7:3}   and seven pairs of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.
{Gen 7:3}   空中的飞鸟也要带七公七母，可以留种，活在全地上；
{Gen 7:4}   For in seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground."
{Gen 7:4}   因为再过七天，我要降雨在地上四十昼夜，把我所造的各种活物都从地上除灭。”
{Gen 7:5}   And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.

{Gen 7:7}   挪亚就同他的妻和儿子儿妇都进入方舟，躲避洪水。
{Gen 7:8}   Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
{Gen 7:8}   洁净的畜类和不洁净的畜类，飞鸟并地上一切的昆虫，
{Gen 7:9}   two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.

{Gen 7:10}  And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.
{Gen 7:10}  过了那七天，洪水泛滥在地上。
{Gen 7:11}  In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
{Gen 7:11}  当挪亚六百岁，二月十七日那一天，大渊的泉源都裂开了，天上的窗户也敞开了，
{Gen 7:12}  And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
{Gen 7:12}  四十昼夜降大雨在地上。
{Gen 7:13}  On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,
{Gen 7:13}  正当那日，挪亚和他三个儿子闪、含、雅弗，并挪亚的妻子和三个儿妇，都进入方舟。
{Gen 7:14}  they and every beast, according to its kind, and all the livestock according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, according to its kind, and every bird, according to its kind, every winged creature.
{Gen 7:14}  他们和百兽，各从其类，一切牲畜，各从其类，爬在地上的昆虫，各从其类，一切禽鸟，各从其类，都进入方舟。

{Gen 7:16}  凡有血肉进入方舟的，都是有公有母，正如神所吩咐挪亚的。耶和华就把他关在方舟里头。
{Gen 7:17}  The flood continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
{Gen 7:17}  洪水泛滥在地上四十天，水往上长，把方舟从地上漂起。
{Gen 7:18}  The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters.
{Gen 7:18}  水势浩大，在地上大大的往上长，方舟在水面上漂来漂去。
{Gen 7:19}  And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.
{Gen 7:19}  水势在地上极其浩大，天下的高山都淹没了。
{Gen 7:20}  The waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.
{Gen 7:20}  水势比山高过十五肘，山岭都淹没了。
{Gen 7:21}  And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all mankind.
{Gen 7:21}  凡在地上有血肉的动物，就是飞鸟、牲畜、走兽，和爬在地上的昆虫，以及所有的人，都死了。
{Gen 7:22}  Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
{Gen 7:22}  凡在旱地上、鼻孔有气息的生灵都死了。
{Gen 7:23}  He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.
{Gen 7:23}  凡地上各类的活物，连人带牲畜、昆虫，以及空中的飞鸟，都从地上除灭了，只留下挪亚和那些与他同在方舟里的。
{Gen 7:24}  And the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.
{Gen 7:24}  水势浩大，在地上共一百五十天。
{Gen 8:1}   But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided.
{Gen 8:1}   神记念挪亚和挪亚方舟里的一切走兽牲畜。神叫风吹地，水势渐落。
{Gen 8:2}   The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,
{Gen 8:2}   渊源和天上的窗户都闭塞了，天上的大雨也止住了。
{Gen 8:3}   and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days the waters had abated,
{Gen 8:3}   水从地上渐退。过了一百五十天，水就渐消。
{Gen 8:4}   and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
{Gen 8:4}   七月十七日，方舟停在亚拉腊山上。
{Gen 8:5}   And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
{Gen 8:5}   水又渐消，到十月初一日，山顶都现出来了。
{Gen 8:6}   At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
{Gen 8:6}   过了四十天，挪亚开了方舟的窗户，
{Gen 8:7}   and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
{Gen 8:7}   放出一只乌鸦去；那乌鸦飞来飞去，直到地上的水都干了。
{Gen 8:8}   Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground.
{Gen 8:8}   他又放出一只鸽子去，要看看水从地上退了没有。
{Gen 8:9}   But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.
{Gen 8:9}   但遍地上都是水，鸽子找不着落脚之地，就回到方舟挪亚那里，挪亚伸手把鸽子接进方舟来。
{Gen 8:10}  He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.
{Gen 8:10}  他又等了七天，再把鸽子从方舟放出去。
{Gen 8:11}  And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
{Gen 8:11}  到了晚上，鸽子回到他那里，嘴里叼着一个新拧下来的橄榄叶子，挪亚就知道地上的水退了。
{Gen 8:12}  Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.
{Gen 8:12}  他又等了七天，放出鸽子去，鸽子就不再回来了。
{Gen 8:13}  In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.
{Gen 8:13}  到挪亚六百零一岁，正月初一日，地上的水都干了。挪亚撤去方舟的盖观看，便见地面上干了。
{Gen 8:14}  In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out.
{Gen 8:14}  到了二月二十七日，地就都干了。
{Gen 8:15}  Then God said to Noah,
{Gen 8:15}  神对挪亚说：
{Gen 8:16}  "Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
{Gen 8:16}  “你和你的妻子、儿子、儿妇都可以出方舟。
{Gen 8:17}  Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh--birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth--that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."
{Gen 8:17}  在你那里凡有血肉的活物，就是飞鸟、牲畜，和一切爬在地上的昆虫，都要带出来，叫他在地上多多滋生，大大兴旺。”
{Gen 8:18}  So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.
{Gen 8:18}  于是挪亚和他的妻子、儿子、儿妇都出来了。
{Gen 8:19}  Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by families from the ark.
{Gen 8:19}  一切走兽、昆虫、飞鸟，和地上所有的动物，各从其类，也都出了方舟。
{Gen 8:20}  Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
{Gen 8:20}  挪亚为耶和华筑了一座坛，拿各类洁净的牲畜、飞鸟献在坛上为燔祭。
{Gen 8:21}  And when the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, the LORD said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done.
{Gen 8:21}  耶和华闻那馨香之气，就心里说：“我不再因人的缘故咒诅地（人从小时心里怀着恶念），也不再按着我才行的灭各种的活物了。
{Gen 8:22}  While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease."
{Gen 8:22}  地还存留的时候，稼穑、寒暑、冬夏、昼夜就永不停息了。”
{Gen 9:1}   And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
{Gen 9:1}   神赐福给挪亚和他的儿子，对他们说：“你们要生养众多，遍满了地。
{Gen 9:2}   The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are delivered.
{Gen 9:2}   凡地上的走兽和空中的飞鸟都必惊恐，惧怕你们，连地上一切的昆虫并海里一切的鱼都交付你们的手。
{Gen 9:3}   Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.
{Gen 9:3}   凡活着的动物都可以作你们的食物。这一切我都赐给你们，如同菜蔬一样。
{Gen 9:4}   But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
{Gen 9:4}   惟独肉带着血，那就是他的生命，你们不可吃。
{Gen 9:5}   And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.
{Gen 9:5}   流你们血、害你们命的，无论是兽是人，我必讨他的罪，就是向各人的弟兄也是如此。
{Gen 9:6}   "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.
{Gen 9:6}   凡流人血的，他的血也必被人所流，因为神造人是照自己的形像造的。
{Gen 9:7}   And you, be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it."
{Gen 9:7}   你们要生养众多，在地上昌盛繁茂。”
{Gen 9:8}   Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,
{Gen 9:8}   神晓谕挪亚和他的儿子说：
{Gen 9:9}   "Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you,
{Gen 9:9}   “我与你们和你们的后裔立约，
{Gen 9:10}  and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth.
{Gen 9:10}  并与你们这里的一切活物、就是飞鸟、牲畜、走兽，凡从方舟里出来的活物立约。
{Gen 9:11}  I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth."
{Gen 9:11}  我与你们立约，凡有血肉的，不再被洪水灭绝，也不再有洪水毁坏地了。”
{Gen 9:12}  And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:
{Gen 9:12}  神说：“我与你们并你们这里的各样活物所立的永约是有记号的。
{Gen 9:13}  I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
{Gen 9:13}  我把虹放在云彩中，这就可作我与地立约的记号了。
{Gen 9:14}  When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,
{Gen 9:14}  我使云彩盖地的时候，必有虹现在云彩中，
{Gen 9:15}  I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
{Gen 9:15}  我便记念我与你们和各样有血肉的活物所立的约，水就再不泛滥、毁坏一切有血肉的物了。
{Gen 9:16}  When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
{Gen 9:16}  虹必现在云彩中，我看见，就要记念我与地上各样有血肉的活物所立的永约。”
{Gen 9:17}  God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
{Gen 9:17}  神对挪亚说：“这就是我与地上一切有血肉之物立约的记号了。”
{Gen 9:18}  The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)
{Gen 9:18}  出方舟挪亚的儿子就是闪、含、雅弗。含是迦南的父亲。
{Gen 9:19}  These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the people of the whole earth were dispersed.
{Gen 9:19}  这是挪亚的三个儿子，他们的后裔分散在全地。
{Gen 9:20}  Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard.
{Gen 9:20}  挪亚作起农夫来，栽了一个葡萄园。
{Gen 9:21}  He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.
{Gen 9:21}  他喝了园中的酒便醉了，在帐棚里赤着身子。
{Gen 9:22}  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.
{Gen 9:22}  迦南的父亲含看见他父亲赤身，就到外边告诉他两个弟兄。
{Gen 9:23}  Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness.
{Gen 9:23}  于是闪和雅弗拿件衣服搭在肩上，倒退着进去，给他父亲盖上；他们背着脸就看不见父亲的赤身。
{Gen 9:24}  When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
{Gen 9:24}  挪亚醒了酒，知道小儿子向他所做的事，
{Gen 9:25}  he said, "Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers."
{Gen 9:25}  就说：迦南当受咒诅，必给他弟兄作奴仆的奴仆；
{Gen 9:26}  He also said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; and let Canaan be his servant.
{Gen 9:26}  又说：耶和华闪的神是应当称颂的！愿迦南作闪的奴仆。
{Gen 9:27}  May God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant."
{Gen 9:27}  愿神使雅弗扩张，使他住在闪的帐棚里；又愿迦南作他的奴仆。
{Gen 9:28}  After the flood Noah lived 350 years.

{Gen 10:9}  他在耶和华面前是个英勇的猎户，所以俗语说：“像宁录在耶和华面前是个英勇的猎户。”
{Gen 10:10} The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

{Gen 11:1}  Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.
{Gen 11:1}  那时，天下人的口音、言语都是一样。
{Gen 11:2}  And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
{Gen 11:2}  他们往东边迁移的时候，在示拿地遇见一片平原，就住在那里。
{Gen 11:3}  And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
{Gen 11:3}  他们彼此商量说：“来吧！我们要做砖，把砖烧透了。”他们就拿砖当石头，又拿石漆当灰泥。

{Gen 11:4}  他们说：“来吧！我们要建造一座城和一座塔，塔顶通天，为要传扬我们的名，免得我们分散在全地上。”
{Gen 11:5}  And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built.
{Gen 11:5}  耶和华降临，要看看世人所建造的城和塔。
{Gen 11:6}  And the LORD said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
{Gen 11:6}  耶和华说：“看哪，他们成为一样的人民，都是一样的言语，如今既做起这事来，以后他们所要做的事就没有不成就的了。
{Gen 11:7}  Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech."
{Gen 11:7}  我们下去，在那里变乱他们的口音，使他们的言语彼此不通。”
{Gen 11:8}  So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
{Gen 11:8}  于是耶和华使他们从那里分散在全地上；他们就停工，不造那城了。
{Gen 11:9}  Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth.
{Gen 11:9}  因为耶和华在那里变乱天下人的言语，使众人分散在全地上，所以那城名叫巴别（就是变乱的意思）。

{Gen 11:26} When Terah had lived 70 years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
{Gen 11:26} 他拉活到七十岁，生了亚伯兰、拿鹤、哈兰。
{Gen 11:27} Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot.
{Gen 11:27} 他拉的后代记在下面。他拉生亚伯兰、拿鹤、哈兰；哈兰生罗得。
{Gen 11:28} Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
{Gen 11:28} 哈兰死在他的本地迦勒底的吾珥，在他父亲他拉之先。
{Gen 11:29} And Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah.
{Gen 11:29} 亚伯兰、拿鹤各娶了妻：亚伯兰的妻子名叫撒莱；拿鹤的妻子名叫密迦，是哈兰的女儿；哈兰是密迦和亦迦的父亲。
{Gen 11:30} Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.
{Gen 11:30} 撒莱不生育，没有孩子。
{Gen 11:31} Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there.
{Gen 11:31} 他拉带着他儿子亚伯兰和他孙子哈兰的儿子罗得，并他儿妇亚伯兰的妻子撒莱，出了迦勒底的吾珥，要往迦南地去；他们走到哈兰，就住在那里。
{Gen 11:32} The days of Terah were 205 years, and Terah died in Haran.
{Gen 11:32} 他拉共活了二百零五岁，就死在哈兰。
{Gen 12:1}  Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
{Gen 12:1}  耶和华对亚伯兰说：“你要离开本地、本族、父家，往我所要指示你的地去。
{Gen 12:2}  And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
{Gen 12:2}  我必叫你成为大国。我必赐福给你，叫你的名为大；你也要叫别人得福。
{Gen 12:3}  I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
{Gen 12:3}  为你祝福的，我必赐福与他；那咒诅你的，我必咒诅他。地上的万族都要因你得福。”
{Gen 12:4}  So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
{Gen 12:4}  亚伯兰就照着耶和华的吩咐去了；罗得也和他同去。亚伯兰出哈兰的时候年七十五岁。
{Gen 12:5}  And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan,
{Gen 12:5}  亚伯兰将他妻子撒莱和侄儿罗得，连他们在哈兰所积蓄的财物、所得的人口，都带往迦南地去。他们就到了迦南地。
{Gen 12:6}  Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
{Gen 12:6}  亚伯兰经过那地，到了示剑地方、摩利橡树那里。那时迦南人住在那地。
{Gen 12:7}  Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.
{Gen 12:7}  耶和华向亚伯兰显现，说：“我要把这地赐给你的后裔。”亚伯兰就在那里为向他显现的耶和华筑了一座坛。
{Gen 12:8}  From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD.
{Gen 12:8}  从那里他又迁到伯特利东边的山，支搭帐棚；西边是伯特利，东边是艾。他在那里又为耶和华筑了一座坛，求告耶和华的名。
{Gen 12:9}  And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.
{Gen 12:9}  后来亚伯兰又渐渐迁往南地去。
{Gen 12:10} Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
{Gen 12:10} 那地遭遇饥荒。因饥荒甚大，亚伯兰就下埃及去，要在那里暂居。
{Gen 12:11} When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, "I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance,
{Gen 12:11} 将近埃及，就对他妻子撒莱说：“我知道你是容貌俊美的妇人。
{Gen 12:12} and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me, but they will let you live.
{Gen 12:12} 埃及人看见你必说：‘这是他的妻子’，他们就要杀我，却叫你存活。
{Gen 12:13} Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake."
{Gen 12:13} 求你说，你是我的妹子，使我因你得平安，我的命也因你存活。”
{Gen 12:14} When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
{Gen 12:14} 及至亚伯兰到了埃及，埃及人看见那妇人极其美貌。
{Gen 12:15} And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
{Gen 12:15} 法老的臣宰看见了他，就在法老面前夸奖他。那妇人就被带进法老的宫去。
{Gen 12:16} And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
{Gen 12:16} 法老因这妇人就厚待亚伯兰，亚伯兰得了许多牛、羊、骆驼、公驴、母驴、仆婢。
{Gen 12:17} But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
{Gen 12:17} 耶和华因亚伯兰妻子撒莱的缘故，降大灾与法老和他的全家。
{Gen 12:18} So Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
{Gen 12:18} 法老就召了亚伯兰来，说：“你这向我做的是什么事呢？为什么没有告诉我他是你的妻子？
{Gen 12:19} Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go."
{Gen 12:19} 为什么说他是你的妹子，以致我把他取来要作我的妻子？现在你的妻子在这里，可以带他走吧。”
{Gen 12:20} And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.
{Gen 12:20} 于是法老吩咐人将亚伯兰和他妻子，并他所有的都送走了。
{Gen 13:1}  So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.
{Gen 13:1}  亚伯兰带着他的妻子与罗得，并一切所有的，都从埃及上南地去。
{Gen 13:2}  Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
{Gen 13:2}  亚伯兰的金、银、牲畜极多。
{Gen 13:3}  And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
{Gen 13:3}  他从南地渐渐往伯特利去，到了伯特利和艾的中间，就是从前支搭帐棚的地方，
{Gen 13:4}  to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.
{Gen 13:4}  也是他起先筑坛的地方；他又在那里求告耶和华的名。
{Gen 13:5}  And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,
{Gen 13:5}  与亚伯兰同行的罗得也有牛群、羊群、帐棚。
{Gen 13:6}  so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together,
{Gen 13:6}  那地容不下他们；因为他们的财物甚多，使他们不能同居。
{Gen 13:7}  and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.
{Gen 13:7}  当时，迦南人与比利洗人在那地居住。亚伯兰的牧人和罗得的牧人相争。
{Gen 13:8}  Then Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen.
{Gen 13:8}  亚伯兰就对罗得说：“你我不可相争，你的牧人和我的牧人也不可相争，因为我们是骨肉（原文作弟兄）。
{Gen 13:9}  Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left."
{Gen 13:9}  遍地不都在你眼前吗？请你离开我：你向左，我就向右；你向右，我就向左。”
{Gen 13:10} And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
{Gen 13:10} 罗得举目看见约但河的全平原，直到琐珥，都是滋润的，那地在耶和华未灭所多玛、蛾摩拉以先如同耶和华的园子，也像埃及地。
{Gen 13:11} So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.
{Gen 13:11} 于是罗得选择约但河的全平原，往东迁移；他们就彼此分离了。
{Gen 13:12} Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
{Gen 13:12} 亚伯兰住在迦南地，罗得住在平原的城邑，渐渐挪移帐棚，直到所多玛。
{Gen 13:13} Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.
{Gen 13:13} 所多玛人在耶和华面前罪大恶极。
{Gen 13:14} The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, "Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,
{Gen 13:14} 罗得离别亚伯兰以后，耶和华对亚伯兰说：“从你所在的地方，你举目向东西南北观看；
{Gen 13:15} for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.
{Gen 13:15} 凡你所看见的一切地，我都要赐给你和你的后裔，直到永远。
{Gen 13:16} I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.
{Gen 13:16} 我也要使你的后裔如同地上的尘沙那样多，人若能数算地上的尘沙才能数算你的后裔。
{Gen 13:17} Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you."
{Gen 13:17} 你起来，纵横走遍这地，因为我必把这地赐给你。”
{Gen 13:18} So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.
{Gen 13:18} 亚伯兰就搬了帐棚，来到希伯仑幔利的橡树那里居住，在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛。
{Gen 14:1}  In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
{Gen 14:1}  当暗拉非作示拿王，亚略作以拉撒王，基大老玛作以拦王，提达作戈印王的时候，
{Gen 14:2}  these kings made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
{Gen 14:2}  他们都攻打所多玛王比拉、蛾摩拉王比沙、押玛王示纳、洗扁王善以别，和比拉王；比拉就是琐珥。
{Gen 14:3}  And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).
{Gen 14:3}  这五王都在西订谷会合；西订谷就是盐海。
{Gen 14:4}  Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
{Gen 14:4}  他们已经事奉基大老玛十二年，到十三年就背叛了。
{Gen 14:5}  In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
{Gen 14:5}  十四年，基大老玛和同盟的王都来在亚特律加宁，杀败了利乏音人，在哈麦杀败了苏西人，在沙微基列亭杀败了以米人，
{Gen 14:6}  and the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the border of the wilderness.
{Gen 14:6}  在何利人的西珥山杀败了何利人，一直杀到靠近旷野的伊勒巴兰。
{Gen 14:7}  Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling in Hazazon-tamar.
{Gen 14:7}  他们回到安密巴，就是加低斯，杀败了亚玛力全地的人，以及住在哈洗逊他玛的亚摩利人。
{Gen 14:8}  Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim
{Gen 14:8}  于是所多玛王、蛾摩拉王、押玛王、洗扁王，和比拉王（比拉就是琐珥）都出来，在西订谷摆阵，与他们交战，
{Gen 14:9}  with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five.
{Gen 14:9}  就是与以拦王基大老玛、戈印王提达、示拿王暗拉非、以拉撒王亚略交战；乃是四王与五王交战。
{Gen 14:10} Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country.
{Gen 14:10} 西订谷有许多石漆坑。所多玛王和蛾摩拉王逃跑，有掉在坑里的，其余的人都往山上逃跑。
{Gen 14:11} So the enemy took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
{Gen 14:11} 四王就把所多玛和蛾摩拉所有的财物，并一切的粮食都掳掠去了；
{Gen 14:12} They also took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way.
{Gen 14:12} 又把亚伯兰的侄儿罗得和罗得的财物掳掠去了。当时罗得正住在所多玛。
{Gen 14:13} Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram.
{Gen 14:13} 有一个逃出来的人告诉希伯来人亚伯兰；亚伯兰正住在亚摩利人幔利的橡树那里。幔利和以实各并亚乃都是弟兄，曾与亚伯兰联盟。
{Gen 14:14} When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
{Gen 14:14} 亚伯兰听见他侄儿（原文作弟兄）被掳去，就率领他家里生养的精练壮丁三百一十八人，直追到但，
{Gen 14:15} And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.
{Gen 14:15} 便在夜间，自己同仆人分队杀败敌人，又追到大马色左边的何把，
{Gen 14:16} Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people.
{Gen 14:16} 将被掳掠的一切财物夺回来，连他侄儿罗得和他的财物，以及妇女、人民也都夺回来。
{Gen 14:17} After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
{Gen 14:17} 亚伯兰杀败基大老玛和与他同盟的王回来的时候，所多玛王出来，在沙微谷迎接他；沙微谷就是王谷。
{Gen 14:18} And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High.)
{Gen 14:18} 又有撒冷王麦基洗德带着饼和酒出来迎接；他是至高神的祭司。
{Gen 14:19} And he blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth;
{Gen 14:19} 他为亚伯兰祝福，说：“愿天地的主、至高的神赐福与亚伯兰！
{Gen 14:20} and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!" And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
{Gen 14:20} 至高的神把敌人交在你手里，是应当称颂的！”亚伯兰就把所得的拿出十分之一来，给麦基洗德。
{Gen 14:21} And the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself."
{Gen 14:21} 所多玛王对亚伯兰说：“你把人口给我，财物你自己拿去吧！”
{Gen 14:22} But Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth,
{Gen 14:22} 亚伯兰对所多玛王说：“我已经向天地的主至高的神耶和华起誓：
{Gen 14:23} that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
{Gen 14:23} 凡是你的东西，就是一根线、一根鞋带，我都不拿，免得你说：‘我使亚伯兰富足！’
{Gen 14:24} I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share."
{Gen 14:24} 只有仆人所吃的，并与我同行的亚乃、以实各、幔利所应得的分，可以任凭他们拿去。”
{Gen 15:1}  After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: "Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great."
{Gen 15:1}  这事以后，耶和华在异象中有话对亚伯兰说：“亚伯兰，你不要惧怕！我是你的盾牌，必大大的赏赐你。”
{Gen 15:2}  But Abram said, "O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?"
{Gen 15:2}  亚伯兰说：“主耶和华啊，我既无子，你还赐我什么呢？并且要承受我家业的是大马色人以利以谢。”
{Gen 15:3}  And Abram said, "Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir."
{Gen 15:3}  亚伯兰又说：“你没有给我儿子；那生在我家中的人就是我的后嗣。”
{Gen 15:4}  And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: "This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir."
{Gen 15:4}  耶和华又有话对他说：“这人必不成为你的后嗣；你本身所生的才成为你的后嗣。”
{Gen 15:5}  And he brought him outside and said, "Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be."
{Gen 15:5}  于是领他走到外边，说：“你向天观看，数算众星，能数得过来吗？”又对他说：“你的后裔将要如此。”
{Gen 15:6}  And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.
{Gen 15:6}  亚伯兰信耶和华，耶和华就以此为他的义。
{Gen 15:7}  And he said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess."
{Gen 15:7}  耶和华又对他说：“我是耶和华，曾领你出了迦勒底的吾珥，为要将这地赐你为业。”
{Gen 15:8}  But he said, "O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?"
{Gen 15:8}  亚伯兰说：“主耶和华啊，我怎能知道必得这地为业呢？”
{Gen 15:9}  He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
{Gen 15:9}  他说：“你为我取一只三年的母牛，一只三年的母山羊，一只三年的公绵羊，一只斑鸠，一只雏鸽。”
{Gen 15:10} And he brought him all these, cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But he did not cut the birds in half.
{Gen 15:10} 亚伯兰就取了这些来，每样劈开，分成两半，一半对着一半地摆列，只有鸟没有劈开。
{Gen 15:11} And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
{Gen 15:11} 有鸷鸟下来，落在那死畜的肉上，亚伯兰就把他吓飞了。
{Gen 15:12} As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him.
{Gen 15:12} 日头正落的时候，亚伯兰沉沉的睡了；忽然有惊人的大黑暗落在他身上。
{Gen 15:13} Then the LORD said to Abram, "Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years.
{Gen 15:13} 耶和华对亚伯兰说：“你要的确知道，你的后裔必寄居别人的地，又服事那地的人；那地的人要苦待他们四百年。
{Gen 15:14} But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
{Gen 15:14} 并且他们所要服事的那国，我要惩罚，后来他们必带着许多财物从那里出来。
{Gen 15:15} As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.
{Gen 15:15} 但你要享大寿数，平平安安的归到你列祖那里，被人埋葬。
{Gen 15:16} And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete."
{Gen 15:16} 到了第四代，他们必回到此地，因为亚摩利人的罪孽还没有满盈。”
{Gen 15:17} When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
{Gen 15:17} 日落天黑，不料有冒烟的炉并烧着的火把从那些肉块中经过。
{Gen 15:18} On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
{Gen 15:18} 当那日，耶和华与亚伯兰立约，说：“我已赐给你的后裔，从埃及河直到伯拉大河之地，
{Gen 15:19} the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
{Gen 15:19} 就是基尼人、基尼洗人、甲摩尼人、
{Gen 15:20} the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
{Gen 15:20} 赫人、比利洗人、利乏音人、
{Gen 15:21} the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites."
{Gen 15:21} 亚摩利人、迦南人、革迦撒人、耶布斯人之地。”
{Gen 16:1}  Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar.
{Gen 16:1}  亚伯兰的妻子撒莱不给他生儿女。撒莱有一个使女，名叫夏甲，是埃及人。
{Gen 16:2}  And Sarai said to Abram, "Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her." And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
{Gen 16:2}  撒莱对亚伯兰说：“耶和华使我不能生育。求你和我的使女同房，或者我可以因他得孩子（得孩子：原文作被建立）。”亚伯兰听从了撒莱的话。
{Gen 16:3}  So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.
{Gen 16:3}  于是亚伯兰的妻子撒莱将使女埃及人夏甲给了丈夫为妾；那时亚伯兰在迦南已经住了十年。
{Gen 16:4}  And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.
{Gen 16:4}  亚伯兰与夏甲同房，夏甲就怀了孕；他见自己有孕，就小看他的主母。
{Gen 16:5}  And Sarai said to Abram, "May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!"
{Gen 16:5}  撒莱对亚伯兰说：“我因你受屈。我将我的使女放在你怀中，他见自己有了孕，就小看我。愿耶和华在你我中间判断。”
{Gen 16:6}  But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please." Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.
{Gen 16:6}  亚伯兰对撒莱说：“使女在你手下，你可以随意待他。”撒莱苦待他，他就从撒莱面前逃走了。
{Gen 16:7}  The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.
{Gen 16:7}  耶和华的使者在旷野书珥路上的水泉旁遇见他，
{Gen 16:8}  And he said, "Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?" She said, "I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai."
{Gen 16:8}  对他说：“撒莱的使女夏甲，你从那里来？要往那里去？”夏甲说：“我从我的主母撒莱面前逃出来。”
{Gen 16:9}  The angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress and submit to her."
{Gen 16:9}  耶和华的使者对他说：“你回到你主母那里，服在他手下”；
{Gen 16:10} The angel of the LORD also said to her, "I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude."
{Gen 16:10} 又说：“我必使你的后裔极其繁多，甚至不可胜数”；
{Gen 16:11} And the angel of the LORD said to her, "Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because the LORD has listened to your affliction.
{Gen 16:11} 并说：“你如今怀孕要生一个儿子，可以给他起名叫以实玛利（就是神听见的意思），因为耶和华听见了你的苦情。
{Gen 16:12} He shall be a wild donkey of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen."
{Gen 16:12} 他为人必像野驴。他的手要攻打人，人的手也要攻打他；他必住在众弟兄的东边。”
{Gen 16:13} So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, "You are a God of seeing," for she said, "Truly here I have seen him who looks after me."
{Gen 16:13} 夏甲就称那对他说话的耶和华为“看顾人的神”。因而说：“在这里我也看见那看顾我的吗？”
{Gen 16:14} Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.
{Gen 16:14} 所以这井名叫庇耳拉海莱。这井正在加低斯和巴列中间。
{Gen 16:15} And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
{Gen 16:15} 后来夏甲给亚伯兰生了一个儿子；亚伯兰给他起名叫以实玛利。
{Gen 16:16} Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
{Gen 16:16} 夏甲给亚伯兰生以实玛利的时候，亚伯兰年八十六岁。
{Gen 17:1}  When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless,
{Gen 17:1}  亚伯兰年九十九岁的时候，耶和华向他显现，对他说：“我是全能的神。你当在我面前作完全人，
{Gen 17:2}  that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly."
{Gen 17:2}  我就与你立约，使你的后裔极其繁多。”
{Gen 17:3}  Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him,
{Gen 17:3}  亚伯兰俯伏在地；神又对他说：
{Gen 17:4}  "Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.
{Gen 17:4}  “我与你立约：你要作多国的父。
{Gen 17:5}  No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
{Gen 17:5}  从此以后，你的名不再叫亚伯兰，要叫亚伯拉罕，因为我已立你作多国的父。
{Gen 17:6}  I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you.
{Gen 17:6}  我必使你的后裔极其繁多；国度从你而立，君王从你而出。
{Gen 17:7}  And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
{Gen 17:7}  我要与你并你世世代代的后裔坚立我的约，作永远的约，是要作你和你后裔的神。
{Gen 17:8}  And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God."
{Gen 17:8}  我要将你现在寄居的地，就是迦南全地，赐给你和你的后裔永远为业，我也必作他们的神。”
{Gen 17:9}  And God said to Abraham, "As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.
{Gen 17:9}  神又对亚伯拉罕说：“你和你的后裔必世世代代遵守我的约。
{Gen 17:10} This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
{Gen 17:10} 你们所有的男子都要受割礼；这就是我与你并你的后裔所立的约，是你们所当遵守的。
{Gen 17:11} You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.
{Gen 17:11} 你们都要受割礼（原文作割阳皮；十四、二十三、二十四、二十五节同）；这是我与你们立约的证据。
{Gen 17:12} He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised. Every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring,
{Gen 17:12} 你们世世代代的男子，无论是家里生的，是在你后裔之外用银子从外人买的，生下来第八日，都要受割礼。
{Gen 17:13} both he who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money, shall surely be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant.
{Gen 17:13} 你家里生的和你用银子买的，都必须受割礼。这样，我的约就立在你们肉体上作永远的约。
{Gen 17:14} Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant."
{Gen 17:14} 但不受割礼的男子必从民中剪除，因他背了我的约。”
{Gen 17:15} And God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.
{Gen 17:15} 神又对亚伯拉罕说：“你的妻子撒莱不可再叫撒莱，他的名要叫撒拉。
{Gen 17:16} I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall come from her."
{Gen 17:16} 我必赐福给他，也要使你从他得一个儿子。我要赐福给他，他也要作多国之母；必有百姓的君王从他而出。”
{Gen 17:17} Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, "Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?"
{Gen 17:17} 亚伯拉罕就俯伏在地喜笑，心里说：“一百岁的人还能得孩子吗？撒拉已经九十岁了，还能生养吗？”
{Gen 17:18} And Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"
{Gen 17:18} 亚伯拉罕对神说：“但愿以实玛利活在你面前。”
{Gen 17:19} God said, "No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.
{Gen 17:19} 神说：“不然，你妻子撒拉要给你生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫以撒。我要与他坚定所立的约，作他后裔永远的约。
{Gen 17:20} As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation.
{Gen 17:20} 至于以实玛利，我也应允你：我必赐福给他，使他昌盛，极其繁多。他必生十二个族长；我也要使他成为大国。
{Gen 17:21} But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this time next year."
{Gen 17:21} 到明年这时节，撒拉必给你生以撒，我要与他坚定所立的约。”
{Gen 17:22} When he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
{Gen 17:22} 神和亚伯拉罕说完了话，就离开他上升去了。
{Gen 17:23} Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all those born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him.
{Gen 17:23} 正当那日，亚伯拉罕遵着神的命，给他的儿子以实玛利和家里的一切男子，无论是在家里生的，是用银子买的，都行了割礼。
{Gen 17:24} Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
{Gen 17:24} 亚伯拉罕受割礼的时候年九十九岁。
{Gen 17:25} And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
{Gen 17:25} 他儿子以实玛利受割礼的时候年十三岁。
{Gen 17:26} That very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.
{Gen 17:26} 正当那日，亚伯拉罕和他儿子以实玛利一同受了割礼。
{Gen 17:27} And all the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
{Gen 17:27} 家里所有的人，无论是在家里生的，是用银子从外人买的，也都一同受了割礼。
{Gen 18:1}  And the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day.
{Gen 18:1}  耶和华在幔利橡树那里向亚伯拉罕显现出来。那时正热，亚伯拉罕坐在帐棚门口，
{Gen 18:2}  He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth
{Gen 18:2}  举目观看，见有三个人在对面站着。他一见，就从帐棚门口跑去迎接他们，俯伏在地，
{Gen 18:3}  and said, "O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.
{Gen 18:3}  说：“我主，我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你不要离开仆人往前去。
{Gen 18:4}  Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree,
{Gen 18:4}  容我拿点水来，你们洗洗脚，在树下歇息歇息。
{Gen 18:5}  while I bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on--since you have come to your servant." So they said, "Do as you have said."
{Gen 18:5}  我再拿一点饼来，你们可以加添心力，然后往前去。你们既到仆人这里来，理当如此。”他们说：“就照你说的行吧。”
{Gen 18:6}  And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, "Quick! Three seahs of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes."
{Gen 18:6}  亚伯拉罕急忙进帐棚见撒拉，说：“你速速拿三细亚细面调和做饼。”
{Gen 18:7}  And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, who prepared it quickly.
{Gen 18:7}  亚伯拉罕又跑到牛群里，牵了一只又嫩又好的牛犊来，交给仆人，仆人急忙预备好了。
{Gen 18:8}  Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
{Gen 18:8}  亚伯拉罕又取了奶油和奶，并预备好的牛犊来，摆在他们面前，自己在树下站在旁边，他们就吃了。
{Gen 18:9}  They said to him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" And he said, "She is in the tent."
{Gen 18:9}  他们问亚伯拉罕说：“你妻子撒拉在那里？”他说：“在帐棚里。”
{Gen 18:10} The LORD said, "I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him.
{Gen 18:10} 三人中有一位说：“到明年这时候，我必要回到你这里；你的妻子撒拉必生一个儿子。”撒拉在那人后边的帐棚门口也听见了这话。
{Gen 18:11} Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah.
{Gen 18:11} 亚伯拉罕和撒拉年纪老迈，撒拉的月经已断绝了。
{Gen 18:12} So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?"
{Gen 18:12} 撒拉心里暗笑，说：“我既已衰败，我主也老迈，岂能有这喜事呢？”
{Gen 18:13} The LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?'
{Gen 18:13} 耶和华对亚伯拉罕说：“撒拉为什么暗笑，说：‘我既已年老，果真能生养吗？’
{Gen 18:14} Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son."
{Gen 18:14} 耶和华岂有难成的事吗？到了日期，明年这时候，我必回到你这里，撒拉必生一个儿子。”
{Gen 18:15} But Sarah denied it, saying, "I did not laugh," for she was afraid. He said, "No, but you did laugh."
{Gen 18:15} 撒拉就害怕，不承认，说：“我没有笑。”那位说：“不然，你实在笑了。”
{Gen 18:16} Then the men set out from there, and they looked down toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to set them on their way.
{Gen 18:16} 三人就从那里起行，向所多玛观看，亚伯拉罕也与他们同行，要送他们一程。
{Gen 18:17} The LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
{Gen 18:17} 耶和华说：“我所要做的事岂可瞒着亚伯拉罕呢？
{Gen 18:18} seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
{Gen 18:18} 亚伯拉罕必要成为强大的国；地上的万国都必因他得福。
{Gen 18:19} For I have chosen him, that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised him."
{Gen 18:19} 我眷顾他，为要叫他吩咐他的众子和他的眷属遵守我的道，秉公行义，使我所应许亚伯拉罕的话都成就了。”
{Gen 18:20} Then the LORD said, "Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave,
{Gen 18:20} 耶和华说：“所多玛和蛾摩拉的罪恶甚重，声闻于我。
{Gen 18:21} I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know."
{Gen 18:21} 我现在要下去，察看他们所行的，果然尽像那达到我耳中的声音一样吗？若是不然，我也必知道。”
{Gen 18:22} So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD.
{Gen 18:22} 二人转身离开那里，向所多玛去；但亚伯拉罕仍旧站在耶和华面前。
{Gen 18:23} Then Abraham drew near and said, "Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
{Gen 18:23} 亚伯拉罕近前来，说：“无论善恶，你都要剿灭吗？
{Gen 18:24} Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?
{Gen 18:24} 假若那城里有五十个义人，你还剿灭那地方吗？不为城里这五十个义人饶恕其中的人吗？
{Gen 18:25} Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"
{Gen 18:25} 将义人与恶人同杀，将义人与恶人一样看待，这断不是你所行的。审判全地的主岂不行公义吗？”
{Gen 18:26} And the LORD said, "If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake."
{Gen 18:26} 耶和华说：“我若在所多玛城里见有五十个义人，我就为他们的缘故饶恕那地方的众人。”
{Gen 18:27} Abraham answered and said, "Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.
{Gen 18:27} 亚伯拉罕说：“我虽然是灰尘，还敢对主说话。
{Gen 18:28} Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And he said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."
{Gen 18:28} 假若这五十个义人短了五个，你就因为短了五个毁灭全城吗？”他说：“我在那里若见有四十五个，也不毁灭那城。”
{Gen 18:29} Again he spoke to him and said, "Suppose forty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of forty I will not do it."
{Gen 18:29} 亚伯拉罕又对他说：“假若在那里见有四十个怎么样呢？”他说：“为这四十个的缘故，我也不做这事。”
{Gen 18:30} Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there." He answered, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
{Gen 18:30} 亚伯拉罕说：“求主不要动怒，容我说，假若在那里见有三十个怎么样呢？”他说：“我在那里若见有三十个，我也不做这事。”
{Gen 18:31} He said, "Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it."
{Gen 18:31} 亚伯拉罕说：“我还敢对主说话，假若在那里见有二十个怎么样呢？”他说：“为这二十个的缘故，我也不毁灭那城。”
{Gen 18:32} Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there." He answered, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it."
{Gen 18:32} 亚伯拉罕说：“求主不要动怒，我再说这一次，假若在那里见有十个呢？”他说：“为这十个的缘故，我也不毁灭那城。”
{Gen 18:33} And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.
{Gen 18:33} 耶和华与亚伯拉罕说完了话就走了；亚伯拉罕也回到自己的地方去了。
{Gen 19:1}  The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth
{Gen 19:1}  那两个天使晚上到了所多玛；罗得正坐在所多玛城门口，看见他们，就起来迎接，脸伏于地下拜，
{Gen 19:2}  and said, "My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way." They said, "No; we will spend the night in the town square."
{Gen 19:2}  说：“我主啊，请你们到仆人家里洗洗脚，住一夜，清早起来再走。”他们说：“不！我们要在街上过夜。”
{Gen 19:3}  But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
{Gen 19:3}  罗得切切的请他们，他们这才进去，到他屋里。罗得为他们预备筵席，烤无酵饼，他们就吃了。
{Gen 19:4}  But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house.
{Gen 19:4}  他们还没有躺下，所多玛城里各处的人，连老带少，都来围住那房子，
{Gen 19:5}  And they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them."
{Gen 19:5}  呼叫罗得说：“今日晚上到你这里来的人在那里呢？把他们带出来，任我们所为。”
{Gen 19:6}  Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him,
{Gen 19:6}  罗得出来，把门关上，到众人那里，
{Gen 19:7}  and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
{Gen 19:7}  说：“众弟兄，请你们不要做这恶事。
{Gen 19:8}  Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof."
{Gen 19:8}  我有两个女儿，还是处女，容我领出来，任凭你们的心愿而行；只是这两个人既然到我舍下，不要向他们做什么。”
{Gen 19:9}  But they said, "Stand back!" And they said, "This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them." Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down.
{Gen 19:9}  众人说：“退去吧！”又说：“这个人来寄居，还想要作官哪！现在我们要害你比害他们更甚。”众人就向前拥挤罗得，要攻破房门。
{Gen 19:10} But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door.
{Gen 19:10} 只是那二人伸出手来，将罗得拉进屋去，把门关上，
{Gen 19:11} And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.
{Gen 19:11} 并且使门外的人，无论老少，眼都昏迷；他们摸来摸去，总寻不着房门。
{Gen 19:12} Then the men said to Lot, "Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place.
{Gen 19:12} 二人对罗得说：“你这里还有什么人吗？无论是女婿是儿女，和这城中一切属你的人，你都要将他们从这地方带出去。
{Gen 19:13} For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it."
{Gen 19:13} 我们要毁灭这地方；因为城内罪恶的声音在耶和华面前甚大，耶和华差我们来，要毁灭这地方。”
{Gen 19:14} So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, "Up! Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city." But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
{Gen 19:14} 罗得就出去，告诉娶了（或作：将要娶）他女儿的女婿们说：“你们起来离开这地方，因为耶和华要毁灭这城。”他女婿们却以为他说的是戏言。
{Gen 19:15} As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city."
{Gen 19:15} 天明了，天使催逼罗得说：“起来！带着你的妻子和你在这里的两个女儿出去，免得你因这城里的罪恶同被剿灭。”
{Gen 19:16} But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.
{Gen 19:16} 但罗得迟延不走。二人因为耶和华怜恤罗得，就拉着他的手和他妻子的手，并他两个女儿的手，把他们领出来，安置在城外；
{Gen 19:17} And as they brought them out, one said, "Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away."
{Gen 19:17} 领他们出来以后，就说：“逃命吧！不可回头看，也不可在平原站住。要往山上逃跑，免得你被剿灭。”
{Gen 19:18} And Lot said to them, "Oh, no, my lords.
{Gen 19:18} 罗得对他们说：“我主啊，不要如此！
{Gen 19:19} Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die.
{Gen 19:19} 你仆人已经在你眼前蒙恩；你又向我显出莫大的慈爱，救我的性命。我不能逃到山上去，恐怕这灾祸临到我，我便死了。
{Gen 19:20} Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there--is it not a little one?--and my life will be saved!"
{Gen 19:20} 看哪，这座城又小又近，容易逃到，这不是一个小的吗？求你容我逃到那里，我的性命就得存活。”
{Gen 19:21} He said to him, "Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
{Gen 19:21} 天使对他说：“这事我也应允你；我不倾覆你所说的这城。
{Gen 19:22} Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there." Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
{Gen 19:22} 你要速速的逃到那城；因为你还没有到那里，我不能做什么。”因此那城名叫琐珥（就是小的意思）。
{Gen 19:23} The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
{Gen 19:23} 罗得到了琐珥，日头已经出来了。
{Gen 19:24} Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven.
{Gen 19:24} 当时，耶和华将硫磺与火从天上耶和华那里降与所多玛和蛾摩拉，
{Gen 19:25} And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
{Gen 19:25} 把那些城和全平原，并城里所有的居民，连地上生长的，都毁灭了。
{Gen 19:26} But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
{Gen 19:26} 罗得的妻子在后边回头一看，就变成了一根盐柱。
{Gen 19:27} And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
{Gen 19:27} 亚伯拉罕清早起来，到了他从前站在耶和华面前的地方，
{Gen 19:28} And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.
{Gen 19:28} 向所多玛和蛾摩拉与平原的全地观看，不料，那地方烟气上腾，如同烧窑一般。
{Gen 19:29} So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.
{Gen 19:29} 当神毁灭平原诸城的时候，他记念亚伯拉罕，正在倾覆罗得所住之城的时候，就打发罗得从倾覆之中出来。
{Gen 19:30} Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters.
{Gen 19:30} 罗得因为怕住在琐珥，就同他两个女儿从琐珥上去，住在山里；他和两个女儿住在一个洞里。
{Gen 19:31} And the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
{Gen 19:31} 大女儿对小女儿说：“我们的父亲老了，地上又无人按着世上的常规进到我们这里。
{Gen 19:32} Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father."
{Gen 19:32} 来！我们可以叫父亲喝酒，与他同寝。这样，我们好从他存留后裔。”
{Gen 19:33} So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
{Gen 19:33} 于是，那夜他们叫父亲喝酒，大女儿就进去和他父亲同寝；他几时躺下，几时起来，父亲都不知道。
{Gen 19:34} The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father."
{Gen 19:34} 第二天，大女儿对小女儿说：“我昨夜与父亲同寝。今夜我们再叫他喝酒，你可以进去与他同寝。这样，我们好从父亲存留后裔。”
{Gen 19:35} So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
{Gen 19:35} 于是，那夜他们又叫父亲喝酒，小女儿起来与他父亲同寝；他几时躺下，几时起来，父亲都不知道。
{Gen 19:36} Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
{Gen 19:36} 这样，罗得的两个女儿都从他父亲怀了孕。
{Gen 19:37} The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.
{Gen 19:37} 大女儿生了儿子，给他起名叫摩押，就是现今摩押人的始祖。
{Gen 19:38} The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.
{Gen 19:38} 小女儿也生了儿子，给他起名叫便亚米，就是现今亚扪人的始祖。
{Gen 20:1}  From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.
{Gen 20:1}  亚伯拉罕从那里向南地迁去，寄居在加低斯和书珥中间的基拉耳。
{Gen 20:2}  And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
{Gen 20:2}  亚伯拉罕称他的妻撒拉为妹子，基拉耳王亚比米勒差人把撒拉取了去。
{Gen 20:3}  But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife."
{Gen 20:3}  但夜间，神来，在梦中对亚比米勒说：“你是个死人哪！因为你取了那女人来；他原是别人的妻子。”
{Gen 20:4}  Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, "Lord, will you kill an innocent people?
{Gen 20:4}  亚比米勒却还没有亲近撒拉；他说：“主啊，连有义的国，你也要毁灭吗？
{Gen 20:5}  Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this."
{Gen 20:5}  那人岂不是自己对我说‘他是我的妹子’吗？就是女人也自己说：‘他是我的哥哥。’我做这事是心正手洁的。”
{Gen 20:6}  Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.
{Gen 20:6}  神在梦中对他说：“我知道你做这事是心中正直；我也拦阻了你，免得你得罪我，所以我不容你沾着他。
{Gen 20:7}  Now then, return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours."
{Gen 20:7}  现在你把这人的妻子归还他；因为他是先知，他要为你祷告，使你存活。你若不归还他，你当知道，你和你所有的人都必要死。”
{Gen 20:8}  So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.
{Gen 20:8}  亚比米勒清早起来，召了众臣仆来，将这些事都说给他们听，他们都甚惧怕。
{Gen 20:9}  Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done."
{Gen 20:9}  亚比米勒召了亚伯拉罕来，对他说：“你怎么向我这样行呢？我在什么事上得罪了你，你竟使我和我国里的人陷在大罪里？你向我行不当行的事了！”
{Gen 20:10} And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see, that you did this thing?"
{Gen 20:10} 亚比米勒又对亚伯拉罕说：“你见了什么才作这事呢？”
{Gen 20:11} Abraham said, "I did it because I thought, 'There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'
{Gen 20:11} 亚伯拉罕说：“我以为这地方的人总不惧怕神，必为我妻子的缘故杀我。
{Gen 20:12} Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
{Gen 20:12} 况且他也实在是我的妹子；他与我是同父异母，后来作了我的妻子。
{Gen 20:13} And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, "He is my brother."'"
{Gen 20:13} 当神叫我离开父家、飘流在外的时候，我对他说：‘我们无论走到什么地方，你可以对人说：他是我的哥哥；这就是你待我的恩典了。’”
{Gen 20:14} Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him.
{Gen 20:14} 亚比米勒把牛、羊、仆婢赐给亚伯拉罕，又把他的妻子撒拉归还他。
{Gen 20:15} And Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you."
{Gen 20:15} 亚比米勒又说：“看哪，我的地都在你面前，你可以随意居住”；
{Gen 20:16} To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated."
{Gen 20:16} 又对撒拉说：“我给你哥哥一千银子，作为你在合家人面前遮羞的（羞：原文作眼），你就在众人面前没有不是了。”
{Gen 20:17} Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.
{Gen 20:17} 亚伯拉罕祷告神，神就医好了亚比米勒和他的妻子，并他的众女仆，他们便能生育。
{Gen 20:18} For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
{Gen 20:18} 因耶和华为亚伯拉罕的妻子撒拉的缘故，已经使亚比米勒家中的妇人不能生育。
{Gen 21:1}  The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised.
{Gen 21:1}  耶和华按着先前的话眷顾撒拉，便照他所说的给撒拉成就。
{Gen 21:2}  And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him.
{Gen 21:2}  当亚伯拉罕年老的时候，撒拉怀了孕；到神所说的日期，就给亚伯拉罕生了一个儿子。
{Gen 21:3}  Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac.
{Gen 21:3}  亚伯拉罕给撒拉所生的儿子起名叫以撒。
{Gen 21:4}  And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
{Gen 21:4}  以撒生下来第八日，亚伯拉罕照着神所吩咐的，给以撒行了割礼。
{Gen 21:5}  Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
{Gen 21:5}  他儿子以撒生的时候，亚伯拉罕年一百岁。
{Gen 21:6}  And Sarah said, "God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me."
{Gen 21:6}  撒拉说：“神使我喜笑，凡听见的必与我一同喜笑”；
{Gen 21:7}  And she said, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."
{Gen 21:7}  又说：“谁能预先对亚伯拉罕说‘撒拉要乳养婴孩’呢？因为在他年老的时候，我给他生了一个儿子。”
{Gen 21:8}  And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
{Gen 21:8}  孩子渐长，就断了奶。以撒断奶的日子，亚伯拉罕设摆丰盛的筵席。
{Gen 21:9}  But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing.
{Gen 21:9}  当时，撒拉看见埃及人夏甲给亚伯拉罕所生的儿子戏笑，
{Gen 21:10} So she said to Abraham, "Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac."
{Gen 21:10} 就对亚伯拉罕说：“你把这使女和他儿子赶出去！因为这使女的儿子不可与我的儿子以撒一同承受产业。”
{Gen 21:11} And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
{Gen 21:11} 亚伯拉罕因他儿子的缘故很忧愁。
{Gen 21:12} But God said to Abraham, "Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named.
{Gen 21:12} 神对亚伯拉罕说：“你不必为这童子和你的使女忧愁。凡撒拉对你说的话，你都该听从；因为从以撒生的，才要称为你的后裔。
{Gen 21:13} And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring."
{Gen 21:13} 至于使女的儿子，我也必使他的后裔成立一国，因为他是你所生的。”
{Gen 21:14} So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
{Gen 21:14} 亚伯拉罕清早起来，拿饼和一皮袋水，给了夏甲，搭在他的肩上，又把孩子交给他，打发他走。夏甲就走了，在别是巴的旷野走迷了路。
{Gen 21:15} When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes.
{Gen 21:15} 皮袋的水用尽了，夏甲就把孩子撇在小树底下，
{Gen 21:16} Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, "Let me not look on the death of the child." And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.
{Gen 21:16} 自己走开约有一箭之远，相对而坐，说：“我不忍见孩子死”，就相对而坐，放声大哭。
{Gen 21:17} And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
{Gen 21:17} 神听见童子的声音；神的使者从天上呼叫夏甲说：“夏甲，你为何这样呢？不要害怕，神已经听见童子的声音了。
{Gen 21:18} Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation."
{Gen 21:18} 起来！把童子抱在怀中（怀：原文作手），我必使他的后裔成为大国。”
{Gen 21:19} Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
{Gen 21:19} 神使夏甲的眼睛明亮，他就看见一口水井，便去将皮袋盛满了水，给童子喝。
{Gen 21:20} And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow.
{Gen 21:20} 神保佑童子，他就渐长，住在旷野，成了弓箭手。
{Gen 21:21} He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
{Gen 21:21} 他住在巴兰的旷野；他母亲从埃及地给他娶了一个妻子。
{Gen 21:22} At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, "God is with you in all that you do.
{Gen 21:22} 当那时候，亚比米勒同他军长非各对亚伯拉罕说：“凡你所行的事都有神的保佑。
{Gen 21:23} Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned."
{Gen 21:23} 我愿你如今在这里指着神对我起誓，不要欺负我与我的儿子，并我的子孙。我怎样厚待了你，你也要照样厚待我与你所寄居这地的民。”
{Gen 21:24} And Abraham said, "I will swear."
{Gen 21:24} 亚伯拉罕说：“我情愿起誓。”
{Gen 21:25} When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized,
{Gen 21:25} 从前，亚比米勒的仆人霸占了一口水井，亚伯拉罕为这事指责亚比米勒。
{Gen 21:26} Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today."
{Gen 21:26} 亚比米勒说：“谁做这事，我不知道，你也没有告诉我，今日我才听见了。”
{Gen 21:27} So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.
{Gen 21:27} 亚伯拉罕把羊和牛给了亚比米勒，二人就彼此立约。
{Gen 21:28} Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.
{Gen 21:28} 亚伯拉罕把七只母羊羔另放在一处。
{Gen 21:29} And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?"
{Gen 21:29} 亚比米勒问亚伯拉罕说：“你把这七只母羊羔另放在一处，是什么意思呢？”
{Gen 21:30} He said, "These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well."
{Gen 21:30} 他说：“你要从我手里受这七只母羊羔，作我挖这口井的证据。”
{Gen 21:31} Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath.
{Gen 21:31} 所以他给那地方起名叫别是巴（就是盟誓的井的意思），因为他们二人在那里起了誓。
{Gen 21:32} So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
{Gen 21:32} 他们在别是巴立了约，亚比米勒就同他军长非各起身回非利士地去了。
{Gen 21:33} Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.
{Gen 21:33} 亚伯拉罕在别是巴栽上一棵垂丝柳树，又在那里求告耶和华永生神的名。
{Gen 21:34} And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.
{Gen 21:34} 亚伯拉罕在非利士人的地寄居了多日。
{Gen 22:1}  After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
{Gen 22:1}  这些事以后，神要试验亚伯拉罕，就呼叫他说：“亚伯拉罕！”他说：“我在这里。”
{Gen 22:2}  He said, "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you."
{Gen 22:2}  神说：“你带着你的儿子，就是你独生的儿子，你所爱的以撒，往摩利亚地去，在我所要指示你的山上，把他献为燔祭。”
{Gen 22:3}  So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
{Gen 22:3}  亚伯拉罕清早起来，备上驴，带着两个仆人和他儿子以撒，也劈好了燔祭的柴，就起身往神所指示他的地方去了。
{Gen 22:4}  On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.
{Gen 22:4}  到了第三日，亚伯拉罕举目远远的看见那地方。
{Gen 22:5}  Then Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you."
{Gen 22:5}  亚伯拉罕对他的仆人说：“你们和驴在此等候，我与童子往那里去拜一拜，就回到你们这里来。”
{Gen 22:6}  And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.
{Gen 22:6}  亚伯拉罕把燔祭的柴放在他儿子以撒身上，自己手里拿着火与刀；于是二人同行。
{Gen 22:7}  And Isaac said to his father Abraham, "My father!" And he said, "Here I am, my son." He said, "Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
{Gen 22:7}  以撒对他父亲亚伯拉罕说：“父亲哪！”亚伯拉罕说：“我儿，我在这里。”以撒说：“请看，火与柴都有了，但燔祭的羊羔在那里呢？”
{Gen 22:8}  Abraham said, "God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So they went both of them together.
{Gen 22:8}  亚伯拉罕说：“我儿，神必自己预备作燔祭的羊羔。”于是二人同行。
{Gen 22:9}  When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
{Gen 22:9}  他们到了神所指示的地方，亚伯拉罕在那里筑坛，把柴摆好，捆绑他的儿子以撒，放在坛的柴上。
{Gen 22:10} Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
{Gen 22:10} 亚伯拉罕就伸手拿刀，要杀他的儿子。
{Gen 22:11} But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
{Gen 22:11} 耶和华的使者从天上呼叫他说：“亚伯拉罕！亚伯拉罕！”他说：“我在这里。”
{Gen 22:12} He said, "Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."
{Gen 22:12} 天使说：“你不可在这童子身上下手。一点不可害他！现在我知道你是敬畏神的了；因为你没有将你的儿子，就是你独生的儿子，留下不给我。”
{Gen 22:13} And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.
{Gen 22:13} 亚伯拉罕举目观看，不料，有一只公羊，两角扣在稠密的小树中，亚伯拉罕就取了那只公羊来，献为燔祭，代替他的儿子。
{Gen 22:14} So Abraham called the name of that place, "The LORD will provide"; as it is said to this day, "On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided."
{Gen 22:14} 亚伯拉罕给那地方起名叫“耶和华以勒”（就是耶和华必预备的意思），直到今日人还说：“在耶和华的山上必有预备。”
{Gen 22:15} And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven
{Gen 22:15} 耶和华的使者第二次从天上呼叫亚伯拉罕说：
{Gen 22:16} and said, "By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
{Gen 22:16} “耶和华说：‘你既行了这事，不留下你的儿子，就是你独生的儿子，我便指着自己起誓说：
{Gen 22:17} I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies,
{Gen 22:17} 论福，我必赐大福给你；论子孙，我必叫你的子孙多起来，如同天上的星，海边的沙。你子孙必得着仇敌的城门，
{Gen 22:18} and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."
{Gen 22:18} 并且地上万国都必因你的后裔得福，因为你听从了我的话。’”
{Gen 22:19} So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba.
{Gen 22:19} 于是亚伯拉罕回到他仆人那里，他们一同起身往别是巴去，亚伯拉罕就住在别是巴。
{Gen 22:20} Now after these things it was told to Abraham, "Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:
{Gen 22:20} 这事以后，有人告诉亚伯拉罕说：“密迦给你兄弟拿鹤生了几个儿子，
{Gen 22:21} Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
{Gen 22:21} 长子是乌斯，他的兄弟是布斯和亚兰的父亲基母利，
{Gen 22:22} Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
{Gen 22:22} 并基薛、哈琐、必达、益拉、彼土利（彼土利生利百加）。”
{Gen 22:23} (Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
{Gen 22:23} 这八个人都是密迦给亚伯拉罕的兄弟拿鹤生的。
{Gen 22:24} Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
{Gen 22:24} 拿鹤的妾名叫流玛，生了提八、迦含、他辖，和玛迦。
{Gen 23:1}  Sarah lived 127 years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
{Gen 23:1}  撒拉享寿一百二十七岁，这是撒拉一生的岁数。
{Gen 23:2}  And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
{Gen 23:2}  撒拉死在迦南地的基列亚巴，就是希伯仑。亚伯拉罕为他哀恸哭号。
{Gen 23:3}  And Abraham rose up from before his dead and said to the Hittites,
{Gen 23:3}  后来亚伯拉罕从死人面前起来，对赫人说：
{Gen 23:4}  "I am a sojourner and foreigner among you; give me property among you for a burying place, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
{Gen 23:4}  “我在你们中间是外人，是寄居的。求你们在这里给我一块地，我好埋葬我的死人，使他不在我眼前。”
{Gen 23:5}  The Hittites answered Abraham,
{Gen 23:5}  赫人回答亚伯拉罕说：
{Gen 23:6}  "Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead."
{Gen 23:6}  “我主请听。你在我们中间是一位尊大的王子，只管在我们最好的坟地里埋葬你的死人；我们没有一人不容你在他的坟地里埋葬你的死人。”
{Gen 23:7}  Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land.
{Gen 23:7}  亚伯拉罕就起来，向那地的赫人下拜，
{Gen 23:8}  And he said to them, "If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,
{Gen 23:8}  对他们说：“你们若有意叫我埋葬我的死人，使他不在我眼前，就请听我的话，为我求琐辖的儿子以弗仑，
{Gen 23:9}  that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place."
{Gen 23:9}  把田头上那麦比拉洞给我；他可以按着足价卖给我，作我在你们中间的坟地。”
{Gen 23:10} Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city,
{Gen 23:10} 当时以弗仑正坐在赫人中间。于是，赫人以弗仑在城门出入的赫人面前对亚伯拉罕说：
{Gen 23:11} "No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."
{Gen 23:11} “不然，我主请听。我送给你这块田，连田间的洞也送给你，在我同族的人面前都给你，可以埋葬你的死人。”
{Gen 23:12} Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
{Gen 23:12} 亚伯拉罕就在那地的人民面前下拜，
{Gen 23:13} And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, "But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there."
{Gen 23:13} 在他们面前对以弗仑说：“你若应允，请听我的话。我要把田价给你，求你收下，我就在那里埋葬我的死人。”
{Gen 23:14} Ephron answered Abraham,
{Gen 23:14} 以弗仑回答亚伯拉罕说：
{Gen 23:15} "My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead."
{Gen 23:15} “我主请听。值四百舍客勒银子的一块田，在你我中间还算什么呢？只管埋葬你的死人吧！”
{Gen 23:16} Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.
{Gen 23:16} 亚伯拉罕听从了以弗仑，照着他在赫人面前所说的话，把买卖通用的银子平了四百舍客勒给以弗仑。
{Gen 23:17} So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over
{Gen 23:17} 于是，麦比拉、幔利前、以弗仑的那块田和其中的洞，并田间四围的树木，
{Gen 23:18} to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
{Gen 23:18} 都定准归与亚伯拉罕，乃是他在赫人面前并城门出入的人面前买妥的。
{Gen 23:19} After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
{Gen 23:19} 此后，亚伯拉罕把他妻子撒拉埋葬在迦南地幔利前的麦比拉田间的洞里。（幔利就是希伯仑）。
{Gen 23:20} The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as property for a burying place by the Hittites.
{Gen 23:20} 从此，那块田和田间的洞就藉着赫人定准归与亚伯拉罕作坟地。
{Gen 24:1}  Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years. And the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
{Gen 24:1}  亚伯拉罕年纪老迈，向来在一切事上耶和华都赐福给他。
{Gen 24:2}  And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh,
{Gen 24:2}  亚伯拉罕对管理他全业最老的仆人说：“请你把手放在我大腿底下。
{Gen 24:3}  that I may make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell,
{Gen 24:3}  我要叫你指着耶和华天地的主起誓，不要为我儿子娶这迦南地中的女子为妻。
{Gen 24:4}  but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
{Gen 24:4}  你要往我本地本族去，为我的儿子以撒娶一个妻子。”
{Gen 24:5}  The servant said to him, "Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?"
{Gen 24:5}  仆人对他说：“倘若女子不肯跟我到这地方来，我必须将你的儿子带回你原出之地吗？”
{Gen 24:6}  Abraham said to him, "See to it that you do not take my son back there.
{Gen 24:6}  亚伯拉罕对他说：“你要谨慎，不要带我的儿子回那里去。
{Gen 24:7}  The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, 'To your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
{Gen 24:7}  耶和华天上的主曾带领我离开父家和本族的地，对我说话，向我起誓说：‘我要将这地赐给你的后裔。’他必差遣使者在你面前，你就可以从那里为我儿子娶一个妻子。
{Gen 24:8}  But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there."
{Gen 24:8}  倘若女子不肯跟你来，我使你起的誓就与你无干了，只是不可带我的儿子回那里去。”
{Gen 24:9}  So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.
{Gen 24:9}  仆人就把手放在他主人亚伯拉罕的大腿底下，为这事向他起誓。
{Gen 24:10} Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia to the city of Nahor.
{Gen 24:10} 那仆人从他主人的骆驼里取了十匹骆驼，并带些他主人各样的财物，起身往美索不达米亚去，到了拿鹤的城。
{Gen 24:11} And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water.
{Gen 24:11} 天将晚，众女子出来打水的时候，他便叫骆驼跪在城外的水井那里。
{Gen 24:12} And he said, "O LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.
{Gen 24:12} 他说：“耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神啊，求你施恩给我主人亚伯拉罕，使我今日遇见好机会。
{Gen 24:13} Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
{Gen 24:13} 我现今站在井旁，城内居民的女子们正出来打水。
{Gen 24:14} Let the young woman to whom I shall say, 'Please let down your jar that I may drink,' and who shall say, 'Drink, and I will water your camels'--let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master."
{Gen 24:14} 我向哪一个女子说：‘请你拿下水瓶来，给我水喝’，他若说：‘请喝！我也给你的骆驼喝’，愿那女子就作你所预定给你仆人以撒的妻。这样，我便知道你施恩给我主人了。”
{Gen 24:15} Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder.
{Gen 24:15} 话还没有说完，不料，利百加肩头上扛着水瓶出来。利百加是彼土利所生的；彼土利是亚伯拉罕兄弟拿鹤妻子密迦的儿子。
{Gen 24:16} The young woman was very attractive in appearance, a maiden whom no man had known. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.
{Gen 24:16} 那女子容貌极其俊美，还是处女，也未曾有人亲近他。他下到井旁，打满了瓶，又上来。
{Gen 24:17} Then the servant ran to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water to drink from your jar."
{Gen 24:17} 仆人跑上前去迎着他，说：“求你将瓶里的水给我一点喝。”
{Gen 24:18} She said, "Drink, my lord." And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.
{Gen 24:18} 女子说：“我主请喝！”就急忙拿下瓶来，托在手上给他喝。
{Gen 24:19} When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking."
{Gen 24:19} 女子给他喝了，就说：“我再为你的骆驼打水，叫骆驼也喝足。”
{Gen 24:20} So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels.
{Gen 24:20} 他就急忙把瓶里的水倒在槽里，又跑到井旁打水，就为所有的骆驼打上水来。
{Gen 24:21} The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not.
{Gen 24:21} 那人定睛看他，一句话也不说，要晓得耶和华赐他通达的道路没有。
{Gen 24:22} When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,
{Gen 24:22} 骆驼喝足了，那人就拿一个金环，重半舍客勒，两个金镯，重十舍客勒，给了那女子，
{Gen 24:23} and said, "Please tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"
{Gen 24:23} 说：“请告诉我，你是谁的女儿？你父亲家里有我们住宿的地方没有？”
{Gen 24:24} She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
{Gen 24:24} 女子说：“我是密迦与拿鹤之子彼土利的女儿”；
{Gen 24:25} She added, "We have plenty of both straw and fodder, and room to spend the night."
{Gen 24:25} 又说：“我们家里足有粮草，也有住宿的地方。”
{Gen 24:26} The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD
{Gen 24:26} 那人就低头向耶和华下拜，
{Gen 24:27} and said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master's kinsmen."
{Gen 24:27} 说：“耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神是应当称颂的，因他不断的以慈爱诚实待我主人。至于我，耶和华在路上引领我，直走到我主人的兄弟家里。”
{Gen 24:28} Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household about these things.
{Gen 24:28} 女子跑回去，照着这些话告诉他母亲和他家里的人。
{Gen 24:29} Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban ran out toward the man, to the spring.
{Gen 24:29} (SEE 24:30)
{Gen 24:30} As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, "Thus the man spoke to me," he went to the man. And behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
{Gen 24:30} 利百加有一个哥哥，名叫拉班，看见金环，又看见金镯在他妹子的手上，并听见他妹子利百加的话，说那人对我如此如此说。拉班就跑出来往井旁去，到那人跟前，见他仍站在骆驼旁边的井旁那里，
{Gen 24:31} He said, "Come in, O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."
{Gen 24:31} 便对他说：“你这蒙耶和华赐福的，请进来，为什么站在外边？我已经收拾了房屋，也为骆驼预备了地方。”
{Gen 24:32} So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
{Gen 24:32} 那人就进了拉班的家。拉班卸了骆驼，用草料喂上，拿水给那人和跟随的人洗脚，
{Gen 24:33} Then food was set before him to eat. But he said, "I will not eat until I have said what I have to say." He said, "Speak on."
{Gen 24:33} 把饭摆在他面前，叫他吃，他却说：“我不吃，等我说明白我的事情再吃。”拉班说：“请说。”
{Gen 24:34} So he said, "I am Abraham's servant.
{Gen 24:34} 他说：“我是亚伯拉罕的仆人。
{Gen 24:35} The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, camels and donkeys.
{Gen 24:35} 耶和华大大的赐福给我主人，使他昌大，又赐给他羊群、牛群、金银、仆婢、骆驼，和驴。
{Gen 24:36} And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old, and to him he has given all that he has.
{Gen 24:36} 我主人的妻子撒拉年老的时候给我主人生了一个儿子；我主人也将一切所有的都给了这个儿子。
{Gen 24:37} My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell,
{Gen 24:37} 我主人叫我起誓说：‘你不要为我儿子娶迦南地的女子为妻。
{Gen 24:38} but you shall go to my father's house and to my clan and take a wife for my son.'
{Gen 24:38} 你要往我父家、我本族那里去，为我的儿子娶一个妻子。’
{Gen 24:39} I said to my master, 'Perhaps the woman will not follow me.'
{Gen 24:39} 我对我主人说：‘恐怕女子不肯跟我来。’
{Gen 24:40} But he said to me, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father's house.
{Gen 24:40} 他就说：‘我所事奉的耶和华必要差遣他的使者与你同去，叫你的道路通达，你就得以在我父家、我本族那里，给我的儿子娶一个妻子。
{Gen 24:41} Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.'
{Gen 24:41} 只要你到了我本族那里，我使你起的誓就与你无干。他们若不把女子交给你，我使你起的誓也与你无干。’
{Gen 24:42} "I came today to the spring and said, 'O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you are prospering the way that I go,
{Gen 24:42} “我今日到了井旁，便说：‘耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神啊，愿你叫我所行的道路通达。
{Gen 24:43} behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say, "Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,"
{Gen 24:43} 我如今站在井旁，对哪一个出来打水的女子说：请你把你瓶里的水给我一点喝；
{Gen 24:44} and who will say to me, "Drink, and I will draw for your camels also," let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son.'
{Gen 24:44} 他若说：你只管喝，我也为你的骆驼打水；愿那女子就作耶和华给我主人儿子所预定的妻。’
{Gen 24:45} "Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'
{Gen 24:45} 我心里的话还没有说完，利百加就出来，肩头上扛着水瓶，下到井旁打水。我便对他说：‘请你给我水喝。’
{Gen 24:46} She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.' So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also.
{Gen 24:46} 他就急忙从肩头上拿下瓶来，说：‘请喝！我也给你的骆驼喝。’我便喝了；他又给我的骆驼喝了。
{Gen 24:47} Then I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
{Gen 24:47} 我问他说：‘你是谁的女儿？’他说：‘我是密迦与拿鹤之子彼土利的女儿。’我就把环子戴在他鼻子上，把镯子戴在他两手上。
{Gen 24:48} Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.
{Gen 24:48} 随后我低头向耶和华下拜，称颂耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神；因为他引导我走合式的道路，使我得着我主人兄弟的孙女，给我主人的儿子为妻。
{Gen 24:49} Now then, if you are going to show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left."
{Gen 24:49} 现在你们若愿以慈爱诚实待我主人，就告诉我；若不然，也告诉我，使我可以或向左，或向右。”
{Gen 24:50} Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, "The thing has come from the LORD; we cannot speak to you bad or good.
{Gen 24:50} 拉班和彼土利回答说：“这事乃出于耶和华，我们不能向你说好说歹。
{Gen 24:51} Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has spoken."
{Gen 24:51} 看哪，利百加在你面前，可以将他带去，照着耶和华所说的，给你主人的儿子为妻。”
{Gen 24:52} When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before the LORD.
{Gen 24:52} 亚伯拉罕的仆人听见他们这话，就向耶和华俯伏在地。
{Gen 24:53} And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.
{Gen 24:53} 当下仆人拿出金器、银器，和衣服送给利百加，又将宝物送给他哥哥和他母亲。
{Gen 24:54} And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, "Send me away to my master."
{Gen 24:54} 仆人和跟从他的人吃了喝了，住了一夜。早晨起来，仆人就说：“请打发我回我主人那里去吧。”
{Gen 24:55} Her brother and her mother said, "Let the young woman remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go."
{Gen 24:55} 利百加的哥哥和他母亲说：“让女子同我们再住几天，至少十天，然后他可以去。”
{Gen 24:56} But he said to them, "Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."
{Gen 24:56} 仆人说：“耶和华既赐给我通达的道路，你们不要耽误我，请打发我走，回我主人那里去吧。”
{Gen 24:57} They said, "Let us call the young woman and ask her."
{Gen 24:57} 他们说：“我们把女子叫来问问他”，
{Gen 24:58} And they called Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" She said, "I will go."
{Gen 24:58} 就叫了利百加来，问他说：“你和这人同去吗？”利百加说：“我去。”
{Gen 24:59} So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men.
{Gen 24:59} 于是他们打发妹子利百加和他的乳母，同亚伯拉罕的仆人，并跟从仆人的，都走了。
{Gen 24:60} And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "Our sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands, and may your offspring possess the gate of those who hate him!"
{Gen 24:60} 他们就给利百加祝福说：我们的妹子啊，愿你作千万人的母！愿你的后裔得着仇敌的城门！
{Gen 24:61} Then Rebekah and her young women arose and rode on the camels and followed the man. Thus the servant took Rebekah and went his way.
{Gen 24:61} 利百加和他的使女们起来，骑上骆驼，跟着那仆人，仆人就带着利百加走了。
{Gen 24:62} Now Isaac had returned from Beer-lahai-roi and was dwelling in the Negeb.
{Gen 24:62} 那时，以撒住在南地，刚从庇耳·拉海·莱回来。
{Gen 24:63} And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, there were camels coming.
{Gen 24:63} 天将晚，以撒出来在田间默想，举目一看，见来了些骆驼。
{Gen 24:64} And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel
{Gen 24:64} 利百加举目看见以撒，就急忙下了骆驼，
{Gen 24:65} and said to the servant, "Who is that man, walking in the field to meet us?" The servant said, "It is my master." So she took her veil and covered herself.
{Gen 24:65} 问那仆人说：“这田间走来迎接我们的是谁？”仆人说：“是我的主人。”利百加就拿帕子蒙上脸。
{Gen 24:66} And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
{Gen 24:66} 仆人就将所办的一切事都告诉以撒。
{Gen 24:67} Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
{Gen 24:67} 以撒便领利百加进了他母亲撒拉的帐棚，娶了他为妻，并且爱他。以撒自从他母亲不在了，这才得了安慰。
{Gen 25:1}  Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.
{Gen 25:1}  亚伯拉罕又娶了一妻，名叫基土拉。
{Gen 25:2}  She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
{Gen 25:2}  基土拉给他生了心兰、约珊、米但、米甸、伊施巴，和书亚。
{Gen 25:3}  Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
{Gen 25:3}  约珊生了示巴和底但。底但的子孙是亚书利族、利都是族，和利乌米族。
{Gen 25:4}  The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
{Gen 25:4}  米甸的儿子是以法、以弗、哈诺、亚比大，和以勒大。这都是基土拉的子孙。
{Gen 25:5}  Abraham gave all he had to Isaac.
{Gen 25:5}  亚伯拉罕将一切所有的都给了以撒。
{Gen 25:6}  But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still living he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country.
{Gen 25:6}  亚伯拉罕把财物分给他庶出的众子，趁着自己还在世的时候打发他们离开他的儿子以撒，往东方去。
{Gen 25:7}  These are the days of the years of Abraham's life, 175 years.
{Gen 25:7}  亚伯拉罕一生的年日是一百七十五岁。
{Gen 25:8}  Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
{Gen 25:8}  亚伯拉罕寿高年迈，气绝而死，归到他列祖（原文作本民）那里。
{Gen 25:9}  Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre,
{Gen 25:9}  他两个儿子以撒、以实玛利把他埋葬在麦比拉洞里。这洞在幔利前、赫人琐辖的儿子以弗仑的田中，
{Gen 25:10} the field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried, with Sarah his wife.
{Gen 25:10} 就是亚伯拉罕向赫人买的那块田。亚伯拉罕和他妻子撒拉都葬在那里。
{Gen 25:11} After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac settled at Beer-lahai-roi.
{Gen 25:11} 亚伯拉罕死了以后，神赐福给他的儿子以撒。以撒靠近庇耳拉海莱居住。
{Gen 25:12} These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's servant, bore to Abraham.
{Gen 25:12} 撒拉的使女埃及人夏甲给亚伯拉罕所生的儿子是以实玛利。
{Gen 25:13} These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
{Gen 25:13} 以实玛利儿子们的名字，按着他们的家谱记在下面。以实玛利的长子是尼拜约，又有基达、亚德别、米比衫、
{Gen 25:14} Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
{Gen 25:14} 米施玛、度玛、玛撒、
{Gen 25:15} Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
{Gen 25:15} 哈大、提玛、伊突、拿非施、基底玛。
{Gen 25:16} These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes.
{Gen 25:16} 这是以实玛利众子的名字，照着他们的村庄、营寨，作了十二族的族长。
{Gen 25:17} (These are the years of the life of Ishmael: 137 years. He breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.)
{Gen 25:17} 以实玛利享寿一百三十七岁，气绝而死，归到他列祖（原文作本民）那里。
{Gen 25:18} They settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria. He settled over against all his kinsmen.
{Gen 25:18} 他子孙的住处在他众弟兄东边，从哈腓拉直到埃及前的书珥，正在亚述的道上。
{Gen 25:19} These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham fathered Isaac,
{Gen 25:19} 亚伯拉罕的儿子以撒的后代记在下面。亚伯拉罕生以撒。
{Gen 25:20} and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife.
{Gen 25:20} 以撒娶利百加为妻的时候正四十岁。利百加是巴但亚兰地的亚兰人彼土利的女儿，是亚兰人拉班的妹子。
{Gen 25:21} And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
{Gen 25:21} 以撒因他妻子不生育，就为他祈求耶和华；耶和华应允他的祈求，他的妻子利百加就怀了孕。
{Gen 25:22} The children struggled together within her, and she said, "If it is thus, why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.
{Gen 25:22} 孩子们在他腹中彼此相争，他就说：“若是这样，我为什么活着呢（或作：我为什么如此呢）？”他就去求问耶和华。
{Gen 25:23} And the LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the older shall serve the younger."
{Gen 25:23} 耶和华对他说：两国在你腹内；两族要从你身上出来。这族必强于那族；将来大的要服事小的。
{Gen 25:24} When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb.
{Gen 25:24} 生产的日子到了，腹中果然是双子。
{Gen 25:25} The first came out red, all his body like a hairy cloak, so they called his name Esau.
{Gen 25:25} 先产的身体发红，浑身有毛，如同皮衣，他们就给他起名叫以扫（就是有毛的意思）。
{Gen 25:26} Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
{Gen 25:26} 随后又生了以扫的兄弟，手抓住以扫的脚跟，因此给他起名叫雅各（就是抓住的意思）。利百加生下两个儿子的时候，以撒年正六十岁。
{Gen 25:27} When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
{Gen 25:27} 两个孩子渐渐长大，以扫善于打猎，常在田野；雅各为人安静，常住在帐棚里。
{Gen 25:28} Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
{Gen 25:28} 以撒爱以扫，因为常吃他的野味；利百加却爱雅各。
{Gen 25:29} Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted.
{Gen 25:29} 有一天，雅各熬汤，以扫从田野回来累昏了。
{Gen 25:30} And Esau said to Jacob, "Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted!" (Therefore his name was called Edom.)
{Gen 25:30} 以扫对雅各说：“我累昏了，求你把这红汤给我喝。”因此以扫又叫以东（就是红的意思）。
{Gen 25:31} Jacob said, "Sell me your birthright now."
{Gen 25:31} 雅各说：“你今日把长子的名分卖给我吧。”
{Gen 25:32} Esau said, "I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?"
{Gen 25:32} 以扫说：“我将要死，这长子的名分于我有什么益处呢？”
{Gen 25:33} Jacob said, "Swear to me now." So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.
{Gen 25:33} 雅各说：“你今日对我起誓吧。”以扫就对他起了誓，把长子的名分卖给雅各。
{Gen 25:34} Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
{Gen 25:34} 于是雅各将饼和红豆汤给了以扫，以扫吃了喝了，便起来走了。这就是以扫轻看了他长子的名分。
{Gen 26:1}  Now there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelech king of the Philistines.
{Gen 26:1}  在亚伯拉罕的日子，那地有一次饥荒；这时又有饥荒，以撒就往基拉耳去，到非利士人的王亚比米勒那里。
{Gen 26:2}  And the LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you.
{Gen 26:2}  耶和华向以撒显现，说：“你不要下埃及去，要住在我所指示你的地。
{Gen 26:3}  Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you, for to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father.
{Gen 26:3}  你寄居在这地，我必与你同在，赐福给你，因为我要将这些地都赐给你和你的后裔。我必坚定我向你父亚伯拉罕所起的誓。
{Gen 26:4}  I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,
{Gen 26:4}  我要加增你的后裔，像天上的星那样多，又要将这些地都赐给你的后裔。并且地上万国必因你的后裔得福
{Gen 26:5}  because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
{Gen 26:5}  都因亚伯拉罕听从我的话，遵守我的吩咐和我的命令、律例、法度。”
{Gen 26:6}  So Isaac settled in Gerar.
{Gen 26:6}  以撒就住在基拉耳。
{Gen 26:7}  When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," for he feared to say, "My wife," thinking, "lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah," because she was attractive in appearance.
{Gen 26:7}  那地方的人问到他的妻子，他便说：“那是我的妹子。”原来他怕说：“是我的妻子”；他心里想：“恐怕这地方的人为利百加的缘故杀我”，因为他容貌俊美。
{Gen 26:8}  When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with Rebekah his wife.
{Gen 26:8}  他在那里住了许久。有一天，非利士人的王亚比米勒从窗户里往外观看，见以撒和他的妻子利百加戏玩。
{Gen 26:9}  So Abimelech called Isaac and said, "Behold, she is your wife. How then could you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac said to him, "Because I thought, 'Lest I die because of her.'"
{Gen 26:9}  亚比米勒召了以撒来，对他说：“他实在是你的妻子，你怎么说他是你的妹子？”以撒说：“我心里想，恐怕我因他而死。”
{Gen 26:10} Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
{Gen 26:10} 亚比米勒说：“你向我们做的是什么事呢？民中险些有人和你的妻同寝，把我们陷在罪里。”
{Gen 26:11} So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, "Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
{Gen 26:11} 于是亚比米勒晓谕众民说：“凡沾着这个人，或是他妻子的，定要把他治死。”
{Gen 26:12} And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The LORD blessed him,
{Gen 26:12} 以撒在那地耕种，那一年有百倍的收成。耶和华赐福给他，
{Gen 26:13} and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy.
{Gen 26:13} 他就昌大，日增月盛，成了大富户。
{Gen 26:14} He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him.
{Gen 26:14} 他有羊群牛群，又有许多仆人，非利士人就嫉妒他。
{Gen 26:15} (Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.)
{Gen 26:15} 当他父亲亚伯拉罕在世的日子，他父亲的仆人所挖的井，非利士人全都塞住，填满了土。
{Gen 26:16} And Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we."
{Gen 26:16} 亚比米勒对以撒说：“你离开我们去吧。因为你比我们强盛得多。”
{Gen 26:17} So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.
{Gen 26:17} 以撒就离开那里，在基拉耳谷支搭帐棚，住在那里。
{Gen 26:18} And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And he gave them the names that his father had given them.
{Gen 26:18} 当他父亲亚伯拉罕在世之日所挖的水井因非利士人在亚伯拉罕死后塞住了，以撒就重新挖出来，仍照他父亲所叫的叫那些井的名字。
{Gen 26:19} But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water,
{Gen 26:19} 以撒的仆人在谷中挖井，便得了一口活水井。
{Gen 26:20} the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours." So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
{Gen 26:20} 基拉耳的牧人与以撒的牧人争竞，说：“这水是我们的。”以撒就给那井起名叫埃色（就是相争的意思），因为他们和他相争。
{Gen 26:21} Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah.
{Gen 26:21} 以撒的仆人又挖了一口井，他们又为这井争竞，因此以撒给这井起名叫西提拿（就是为敌的意思）。
{Gen 26:22} And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, saying, "For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
{Gen 26:22} 以撒离开那里，又挖了一口井，他们不为这井争竞了，他就给那井起名叫利河伯（就是宽阔的意思）。他说：“耶和华现在给我们宽阔之地，我们必在这地昌盛。”
{Gen 26:23} From there he went up to Beersheba.
{Gen 26:23} 以撒从那里上别是巴去。
{Gen 26:24} And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, "I am the God of Abraham your father. Fear not, for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake."
{Gen 26:24} 当夜耶和华向他显现，说：“我是你父亲亚伯拉罕的神，不要惧怕！因为我与你同在，要赐福给你，并要为我仆人亚伯拉罕的缘故，使你的后裔繁多。”
{Gen 26:25} So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.
{Gen 26:25} 以撒就在那里筑了一座坛，求告耶和华的名，并且支搭帐棚；他的仆人便在那里挖了一口井。
{Gen 26:26} When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army,
{Gen 26:26} 亚比米勒，同他的朋友亚户撒和他的军长非各，从基拉耳来见以撒。
{Gen 26:27} Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?"
{Gen 26:27} 以撒对他们说：“你们既然恨我，打发我走了，为什么到我这里来呢？”
{Gen 26:28} They said, "We see plainly that the LORD has been with you. So we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you,
{Gen 26:28} 他们说：“我们明明的看见耶和华与你同在，便说，不如我们两下彼此起誓，彼此立约，
{Gen 26:29} that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD."
{Gen 26:29} 使你不害我们，正如我们未曾害你，一味地厚待你，并且打发你平平安安的走。你是蒙耶和华赐福的了。”
{Gen 26:30} So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
{Gen 26:30} 以撒就为他们设摆筵席，他们便吃了喝了。
{Gen 26:31} In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths. And Isaac sent them on their way, and they departed from him in peace.
{Gen 26:31} 他们清早起来彼此起誓。以撒打发他们走，他们就平平安安的离开他走了。
{Gen 26:32} That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him, "We have found water."
{Gen 26:32} 那一天，以撒的仆人来，将挖井的事告诉他说：“我们得了水了。”
{Gen 26:33} He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
{Gen 26:33} 他就给那井起名叫示巴；因此那城叫做别是巴，直到今日。
{Gen 26:34} When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite,
{Gen 26:34} 以扫四十岁的时候娶了赫人比利的女儿犹滴，与赫人以伦的女儿巴实抹为妻。
{Gen 26:35} and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.
{Gen 26:35} 他们常使以撒和利百加心里愁烦。
{Gen 27:1}  When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, "My son"; and he answered, "Here I am."
{Gen 27:1}  以撒年老，眼睛昏花，不能看见，就叫了他大儿子以扫来，说：“我儿。”以扫说：“我在这里。”
{Gen 27:2}  He said, "Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.
{Gen 27:2}  他说：“我如今老了，不知道哪一天死。
{Gen 27:3}  Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me,
{Gen 27:3}  现在拿你的器械，就是箭囊和弓，往田野去为我打猎，
{Gen 27:4}  and prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die."
{Gen 27:4}  照我所爱的做成美味，拿来给我吃，使我在未死之先给你祝福。”
{Gen 27:5}  Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,
{Gen 27:5}  以撒对他儿子以扫说话，利百加也听见了。以扫往田野去打猎，要得野味带来。
{Gen 27:6}  Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "I heard your father speak to your brother Esau,
{Gen 27:6}  利百加就对他儿子雅各说：“我听见你父亲对你哥哥以扫说：
{Gen 27:7}  'Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.'
{Gen 27:7}  ‘你去把野兽带来，做成美味给我吃，我好在未死之先，在耶和华面前给你祝福。’
{Gen 27:8}  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you.
{Gen 27:8}  现在，我儿，你要照着我所吩咐你的，听从我的话。
{Gen 27:9}  Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves.
{Gen 27:9}  你到羊群里去，给我拿两只肥山羊羔来，我便照你父亲所爱的给他做成美味。
{Gen 27:10} And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies."
{Gen 27:10} 你拿到你父亲那里给他吃，使他在未死之先给你祝福。”
{Gen 27:11} But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
{Gen 27:11} 雅各对他母亲利百加说：“我哥哥以扫浑身是有毛的，我身上是光滑的；
{Gen 27:12} Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing."
{Gen 27:12} 倘若我父亲摸着我，必以我为欺哄人的，我就招咒诅，不得祝福。”
{Gen 27:13} His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me."
{Gen 27:13} 他母亲对他说：“我儿，你招的咒诅归到我身上；你只管听我的话，去把羊羔给我拿来。”
{Gen 27:14} So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved.
{Gen 27:14} 他便去拿来，交给他母亲；他母亲就照他父亲所爱的做成美味。
{Gen 27:15} Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.
{Gen 27:15} 利百加又把家里所存大儿子以扫上好的衣服给他小儿子雅各穿上，
{Gen 27:16} And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
{Gen 27:16} 又用山羊羔皮包在雅各的手上和颈项的光滑处，
{Gen 27:17} And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
{Gen 27:17} 就把所做的美味和饼交在他儿子雅各的手里。
{Gen 27:18} So he went in to his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?"
{Gen 27:18} 雅各到他父亲那里说：“我父亲！”他说：“我在这里。我儿，你是谁？”
{Gen 27:19} Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me."
{Gen 27:19} 雅各对他父亲说：“我是你的长子以扫；我已照你所吩咐我的行了。请起来坐着，吃我的野味，好给我祝福。”
{Gen 27:20} But Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?" He answered, "Because the LORD your God granted me success."
{Gen 27:20} 以撒对他儿子说：“我儿，你如何找得这么快呢？”他说：“因为耶和华你的神使我遇见好机会得着的。”
{Gen 27:21} Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not."
{Gen 27:21} 以撒对雅各说：“我儿，你近前来，我摸摸你，知道你真是我的儿子以扫不是。”
{Gen 27:22} So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
{Gen 27:22} 雅各就挨近他父亲以撒。以撒摸着他，说：“声音是雅各的声音，手却是以扫的手。”
{Gen 27:23} And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.
{Gen 27:23} 以撒就辨不出他来；因为他手上有毛，像他哥哥以扫的手一样，就给他祝福；
{Gen 27:24} He said, "Are you really my son Esau?" He answered, "I am."
{Gen 27:24} 又说：“你真是我儿子以扫吗？”他说：“我是。”
{Gen 27:25} Then he said, "Bring it near to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you." So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
{Gen 27:25} 以撒说：“你递给我，我好吃我儿子的野味，给你祝福。”雅各就递给他，他便吃了，又拿酒给他，他也喝了。
{Gen 27:26} Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come near and kiss me, my son."
{Gen 27:26} 他父亲以撒对他说：“我儿，你上前来与我亲嘴。”
{Gen 27:27} So he came near and kissed him. And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said, "See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed!
{Gen 27:27} 他就上前与父亲亲嘴。他父亲一闻他衣服上的香气，就给他祝福，说：我儿的香气如同耶和华赐福之田地的香气一样。
{Gen 27:28} May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and wine.
{Gen 27:28} 愿神赐你天上的甘露，地上的肥土，并许多五谷新酒。
{Gen 27:29} Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you!"
{Gen 27:29} 愿多民事奉你，多国跪拜你。愿你作你弟兄的主；你母亲的儿子向你跪拜。凡咒诅你的，愿他受咒诅；为你祝福的，愿他蒙福。
{Gen 27:30} As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
{Gen 27:30} 以撒为雅各祝福已毕，雅各从他父亲那里才出来，他哥哥以扫正打猎回来，
{Gen 27:31} He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, "Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me."
{Gen 27:31} 也做了美味，拿来给他父亲，说：“请父亲起来，吃你儿子的野味，好给我祝福。”
{Gen 27:32} His father Isaac said to him, "Who are you?" He answered, "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."
{Gen 27:32} 他父亲以撒对他说：“你是谁？”他说：“我是你的长子以扫。”
{Gen 27:33} Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, "Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed."
{Gen 27:33} 以撒就大大的战兢，说：“你未来之先，是谁得了野味拿来给我呢？我已经吃了，为他祝福；他将来也必蒙福。”
{Gen 27:34} As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, O my father!"
{Gen 27:34} 以扫听了他父亲的话，就放声痛哭，说：“我父啊，求你也为我祝福！”
{Gen 27:35} But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing."
{Gen 27:35} 以撒说：“你兄弟已经用诡计来将你的福分夺去了。”
{Gen 27:36} Esau said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing." Then he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"
{Gen 27:36} 以扫说：“他名雅各，岂不是正对吗？因为他欺骗了我两次：他从前夺了我长子的名分，你看，他现在又夺了我的福分。”以扫又说：“你没有留下为我可祝的福吗？”
{Gen 27:37} Isaac answered and said to Esau, "Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?"
{Gen 27:37} 以撒回答以扫说：“我已立他为你的主，使他的弟兄都给他作仆人，并赐他五谷新酒可以养生。我儿，现在我还能为你做什么呢？”
{Gen 27:38} Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father." And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
{Gen 27:38} 以扫对他父亲说：“父啊，你只有一样可祝的福吗？我父啊，求你也为我祝福！”以扫就放声而哭。
{Gen 27:39} Then Isaac his father answered and said to him: "Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven on high.
{Gen 27:39} 他父亲以撒说：地上的肥土必为你所住；天上的甘露必为你所得。
{Gen 27:40} By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but when you grow restless you shall break his yoke from your neck."
{Gen 27:40} 你必倚靠刀剑度日，又必事奉你的兄弟；到你强盛的时候，必从你颈项上挣开他的轭。
{Gen 27:41} Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob."
{Gen 27:41} 以扫因他父亲给雅各祝的福，就怨恨雅各，心里说：“为我父亲居丧的日子近了，到那时候，我要杀我的兄弟雅各。”
{Gen 27:42} But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, "Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.
{Gen 27:42} 有人把利百加大儿子以扫的话告诉利百加，他就打发人去，叫了他小儿子雅各来，对他说：“你哥哥以扫想要杀你，报仇雪恨。
{Gen 27:43} Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran
{Gen 27:43} 现在，我儿，你要听我的话：起来，逃往哈兰、我哥哥拉班那里去，
{Gen 27:44} and stay with him a while, until your brother's fury turns away--
{Gen 27:44} 同他住些日子，直等你哥哥的怒气消了。
{Gen 27:45} until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?"
{Gen 27:45} 你哥哥向你消了怒气，忘了你向他所做的事，我便打发人去把你从那里带回来。为什么一日丧你们二人呢？”
{Gen 27:46} Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I loathe my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?"
{Gen 27:46} 利百加对以撒说：“我因这赫人的女子连性命都厌烦了；倘若雅各也娶赫人的女子为妻，像这些一样，我活着还有什么益处呢？”
{Gen 28:1}  Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and directed him, "You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women.
{Gen 28:1}  以撒叫了雅各来，给他祝福，并嘱咐他说：“你不要娶迦南的女子为妻。
{Gen 28:2}  Arise, go to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel your mother's father, and take as your wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.
{Gen 28:2}  你起身往巴但亚兰去，到你外祖彼土利家里，在你母舅拉班的女儿中娶一女为妻。
{Gen 28:3}  God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.
{Gen 28:3}  愿全能的神赐福给你，使你生养众多，成为多族，
{Gen 28:4}  May he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojournings that God gave to Abraham!"
{Gen 28:4}  将应许亚伯拉罕的福赐给你和你的后裔，使你承受你所寄居的地为业，就是神赐给亚伯拉罕的地。”
{Gen 28:5}  Thus Isaac sent Jacob away. And he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
{Gen 28:5}  以撒打发雅各走了，他就往巴但亚兰去，到亚兰人彼土利的儿子拉班那里。拉班是雅各、以扫的母舅。
{Gen 28:6}  Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he directed him, "You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women,"
{Gen 28:6}  以扫见以撒已经给雅各祝福，而且打发他往巴但亚兰去，在那里娶妻，并见祝福的时候嘱咐他说：“不要娶迦南的女子为妻”，
{Gen 28:7}  and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram.
{Gen 28:7}  又见雅各听从父母的话往巴但亚兰去了，
{Gen 28:8}  So when Esau saw that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father,
{Gen 28:8}  以扫就晓得他父亲以撒看不中迦南的女子，
{Gen 28:9}  Esau went to Ishmael and took as his wife, besides the wives he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth.
{Gen 28:9}  便往以实玛利那里去，在他二妻之外又娶了玛哈拉为妻。他是亚伯拉罕儿子以实玛利的女儿，尼拜约的妹子。
{Gen 28:10} Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran.
{Gen 28:10} 雅各出了别是巴，向哈兰走去；
{Gen 28:11} And he came to a certain place and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep.
{Gen 28:11} 到了一个地方，因为太阳落了，就在那里住宿，便拾起那地方的一块石头枕在头下，在那里躺卧睡了，
{Gen 28:12} And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!
{Gen 28:12} 梦见一个梯子立在地上，梯子的头顶着天，有神的使者在梯子上，上去下来。
{Gen 28:13} And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, "I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring.
{Gen 28:13} 耶和华站在梯子以上（或作：站在他旁边），说：“我是耶和华你祖亚伯拉罕的神，也是以撒的神；我要将你现在所躺卧之地赐给你和你的后裔。
{Gen 28:14} Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
{Gen 28:14} 你的后裔必像地上的尘沙那样多，必向东西南北开展；地上万族必因你和你的后裔得福。
{Gen 28:15} Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."
{Gen 28:15} 我也与你同在。你无论往那里去，我必保佑你，领你归回这地，总不离弃你，直到我成全了向你所应许的。”
{Gen 28:16} Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it."
{Gen 28:16} 雅各睡醒了，说：“耶和华真在这里，我竟不知道！”
{Gen 28:17} And he was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
{Gen 28:17} 就惧怕，说：“这地方何等可畏！这不是别的，乃是神的殿，也是天的门。”
{Gen 28:18} So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.
{Gen 28:18} 雅各清早起来，把所枕的石头立作柱子，浇油在上面。
{Gen 28:19} He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
{Gen 28:19} 他就给那地方起名叫伯特利（就是神殿的意思）；但那地方起先名叫路斯。
{Gen 28:20} Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,
{Gen 28:20} 雅各许愿说：“神若与我同在，在我所行的路上保佑我，又给我食物吃，衣服穿，
{Gen 28:21} so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God,
{Gen 28:21} 使我平平安安的回到我父亲的家，我就必以耶和华为我的神。
{Gen 28:22} and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you."
{Gen 28:22} 我所立为柱子的石头也必作神的殿；凡你所赐给我的，我必将十分之一献给你。”
{Gen 29:1}  Then Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the east.
{Gen 29:1}  雅各起行，到了东方人之地，
{Gen 29:2}  As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was large,
{Gen 29:2}  看见田间有一口井，有三群羊卧在井旁；因为人饮羊群都是用那井里的水。井口上的石头是大的。
{Gen 29:3}  and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well.
{Gen 29:3}  常有羊群在那里聚集，牧人把石头转离井口饮羊，随后又把石头放在井口的原处。
{Gen 29:4}  Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where do you come from?" They said, "We are from Haran."
{Gen 29:4}  雅各对牧人说：“弟兄们，你们是那里来的？”他们说：“我们是哈兰来的。”
{Gen 29:5}  He said to them, "Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?" They said, "We know him."
{Gen 29:5}  他问他们说：“拿鹤的孙子拉班，你们认识吗？”他们说：“我们认识。”
{Gen 29:6}  He said to them, "Is it well with him?" They said, "It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!"
{Gen 29:6}  雅各说：“他平安吗？”他们说：“平安。看哪，他女儿拉结领着羊来了。”
{Gen 29:7}  He said, "Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them."
{Gen 29:7}  雅各说：“日头还高，不是羊群聚集的时候，你们不如饮羊，再去放一放。”
{Gen 29:8}  But they said, "We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep."
{Gen 29:8}  他们说：“我们不能，必等羊群聚齐，人把石头转离井口才可饮羊。”
{Gen 29:9}  While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
{Gen 29:9}  雅各正和他们说话的时候，拉结领着他父亲的羊来了，因为那些羊是他牧放的。
{Gen 29:10} Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
{Gen 29:10} 雅各看见母舅拉班的女儿拉结和母舅拉班的羊群，就上前把石头转离井口，饮他母舅拉班的羊群。
{Gen 29:11} Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.
{Gen 29:11} 雅各与拉结亲嘴，就放声而哭。
{Gen 29:12} And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her father.
{Gen 29:12} 雅各告诉拉结，自己是他父亲的外甥，是利百加的儿子，拉结就跑去告诉他父亲。
{Gen 29:13} As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things,
{Gen 29:13} 拉班听见外甥雅各的信息，就跑去迎接，抱着他，与他亲嘴，领他到自己的家。雅各将一切的情由告诉拉班。
{Gen 29:14} and Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh!" And he stayed with him a month.
{Gen 29:14} 拉班对他说：“你实在是我的骨肉。”雅各就和他同住了一个月。
{Gen 29:15} Then Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"
{Gen 29:15} 拉班对雅各说：“你虽是我的骨肉（原文作弟兄），岂可白白地服事我？请告诉我，你要什么为工价？”
{Gen 29:16} Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
{Gen 29:16} 拉班有两个女儿，大的名叫利亚，小的名叫拉结。
{Gen 29:17} Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.
{Gen 29:17} 利亚的眼睛没有神气，拉结却生得美貌俊秀。
{Gen 29:18} Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."
{Gen 29:18} 雅各爱拉结，就说：“我愿为你小女儿拉结服事你七年。”
{Gen 29:19} Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me."
{Gen 29:19} 拉班说：“我把他给你，胜似给别人，你与我同住吧！”
{Gen 29:20} So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.
{Gen 29:20} 雅各就为拉结服事了七年；他因为深爱拉结，就看这七年如同几天。
{Gen 29:21} Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed."
{Gen 29:21} 雅各对拉班说：“日期已经满了，求你把我的妻子给我，我好与他同房。”
{Gen 29:22} So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast.
{Gen 29:22} 拉班就摆设筵席，请齐了那地方的众人。
{Gen 29:23} But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her.
{Gen 29:23} 到晚上，拉班将女儿利亚送来给雅各，雅各就与他同房。
{Gen 29:24} (Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)
{Gen 29:24} 拉班又将婢女悉帕给女儿利亚作使女。
{Gen 29:25} And in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"
{Gen 29:25} 到了早晨，雅各一看是利亚，就对拉班说：“你向我做的是什么事呢？我服事你，不是为拉结吗？你为什么欺哄我呢？”
{Gen 29:26} Laban said, "It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
{Gen 29:26} 拉班说：“大女儿还没有给人，先把小女儿给人，在我们这地方没有这规矩。
{Gen 29:27} Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years."
{Gen 29:27} 你为这个满了七日，我就把那个也给你，你再为他服事我七年。”
{Gen 29:28} Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
{Gen 29:28} 雅各就如此行。满了利亚的七日，拉班便将女儿拉结给雅各为妻。
{Gen 29:29} (Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.)
{Gen 29:29} 拉班又将婢女辟拉给女儿拉结作使女。
{Gen 29:30} So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.
{Gen 29:30} 雅各也与拉结同房，并且爱拉结胜似爱利亚，于是又服事了拉班七年。
{Gen 29:31} When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.
{Gen 29:31} 耶和华见利亚失宠（原文作被恨；下同），就使他生育，拉结却不生育。
{Gen 29:32} And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, "Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me."
{Gen 29:32} 利亚怀孕生子，就给他起名叫流便（就是有儿子的意思），因而说：“耶和华看见我的苦情，如今我的丈夫必爱我。”
{Gen 29:33} She conceived again and bore a son, and said, "Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also." And she called his name Simeon.
{Gen 29:33} 他又怀孕生子，就说：“耶和华因为听见我失宠，所以又赐给我这个儿子”，于是给他起名叫西缅（就是听见的意思）。
{Gen 29:34} Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, "Now this time my husband will be attached to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore his name was called Levi.
{Gen 29:34} 他又怀孕生子，起名叫利未（就是联合的意思），说：“我给丈夫生了三个儿子，他必与我联合。”
{Gen 29:35} And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, "This time I will praise the LORD." Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she ceased bearing.
{Gen 29:35} 他又怀孕生子，说：“这回我要赞美耶和华”，因此给他起名叫犹大（就是赞美的意思）。这才停了生育。
{Gen 30:1}  When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister. She said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I shall die!"
{Gen 30:1}  拉结见自己不给雅各生子，就嫉妒他姊姊，对雅各说：“你给我孩子，不然我就死了。”
{Gen 30:2}  Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, "Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
{Gen 30:2}  雅各向拉结生气，说：“叫你不生育的是神，我岂能代替他作主呢？”
{Gen 30:3}  Then she said, "Here is my servant Bilhah; go in to her, so that she may give birth on my behalf, that even I may have children through her."
{Gen 30:3}  拉结说：“有我的使女辟拉在这里，你可以与他同房，使他生子在我膝下，我便因他也得孩子（原文作被建立）。”
{Gen 30:4}  So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.
{Gen 30:4}  拉结就把他的使女辟拉给丈夫为妾；雅各便与他同房，
{Gen 30:5}  And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
{Gen 30:5}  辟拉就怀孕，给雅各生了一个儿子。
{Gen 30:6}  Then Rachel said, "God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son." Therefore she called his name Dan.
{Gen 30:6}  拉结说：“神伸了我的冤，也听了我的声音，赐我一个儿子”，因此给他起名叫但（就是伸冤的意思）。
{Gen 30:7}  Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
{Gen 30:7}  拉结的使女辟拉又怀孕，给雅各生了第二个儿子。
{Gen 30:8}  Then Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed." So she called his name Naphtali.
{Gen 30:8}  拉结说：“我与我姊姊大大相争，并且得胜”，于是给他起名叫拿弗他利（就是相争的意思）。
{Gen 30:9}  When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
{Gen 30:9}  利亚见自己停了生育，就把使女悉帕给雅各为妾。
{Gen 30:10} Then Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
{Gen 30:10} 利亚的使女悉帕给雅各生了一个儿子。
{Gen 30:11} And Leah said, "Good fortune has come!" so she called his name Gad.
{Gen 30:11} 利亚说：“万幸！”于是给他起名叫迦得（就是万幸的意思）。
{Gen 30:12} Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
{Gen 30:12} 利亚的使女悉帕又给雅各生了第二个儿子。
{Gen 30:13} And Leah said, "Happy am I! For women have called me happy." So she called his name Asher.
{Gen 30:13} 利亚说：“我有福啊，众女子都要称我是有福的”，于是给他起名叫亚设（就是有福的意思）。
{Gen 30:14} In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
{Gen 30:14} 割麦子的时候，流便往田里去，寻见风茄，拿来给他母亲利亚。拉结对利亚说：“请你把你儿子的风茄给我些。”
{Gen 30:15} But she said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also?" Rachel said, "Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes."
{Gen 30:15} 利亚说：“你夺了我的丈夫还算小事吗？你又要夺我儿子的风茄吗？”拉结说：“为你儿子的风茄，今夜他可以与你同寝。”
{Gen 30:16} When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night.
{Gen 30:16} 到了晚上，雅各从田里回来，利亚出来迎接他，说：“你要与我同寝，因为我实在用我儿子的风茄把你雇下了。”那一夜，雅各就与他同寝。
{Gen 30:17} And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
{Gen 30:17} 神应允了利亚，他就怀孕，给雅各生了第五个儿子。
{Gen 30:18} Leah said, "God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband." So she called his name Issachar.
{Gen 30:18} 利亚说：“神给了我价值，因为我把使女给了我丈夫”，于是给他起名叫以萨迦（就是价值的意思）。
{Gen 30:19} And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.
{Gen 30:19} 利亚又怀孕，给雅各生了第六个儿子。
{Gen 30:20} Then Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good endowment; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons." So she called his name Zebulun.
{Gen 30:20} 利亚说：“神赐我厚赏；我丈夫必与我同住，因我给他生了六个儿子”，于是给他起名西布伦（就是同住的意思）。
{Gen 30:21} Afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.
{Gen 30:21} 后来又生了一个女儿，给他起名叫底拿。
{Gen 30:22} Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.
{Gen 30:22} 神顾念拉结，应允了他，使他能生育。
{Gen 30:23} She conceived and bore a son and said, "God has taken away my reproach."
{Gen 30:23} 拉结怀孕生子，说：“神除去了我的羞耻”，
{Gen 30:24} And she called his name Joseph, saying, "May the LORD add to me another son!"
{Gen 30:24} 就给他起名叫约瑟（就是增添的意思），意思说：“愿耶和华再增添我一个儿子。”
{Gen 30:25} As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country.
{Gen 30:25} 拉结生约瑟之后，雅各对拉班说：“请打发我走，叫我回到我本乡本土去。
{Gen 30:26} Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know the service that I have given you."
{Gen 30:26} 请你把我服事你所得的妻子和儿女给我，让我走；我怎样服事你，你都知道。”
{Gen 30:27} But Laban said to him, "If I have found favor in your sight, I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.
{Gen 30:27} 拉班对他说：“我若在你眼前蒙恩，请你仍与我同住，因为我已算定，耶和华赐福与我是为你的缘故”；
{Gen 30:28} Name your wages, and I will give it."
{Gen 30:28} 又说：“请你定你的工价，我就给你。”
{Gen 30:29} Jacob said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me.
{Gen 30:29} 雅各对他说：“我怎样服事你，你的牲畜在我手里怎样，是你知道的。
{Gen 30:30} For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?"
{Gen 30:30} 我未来之先，你所有的很少，现今却发大众多，耶和华随我的脚步赐福与你。如今，我什么时候才为自己兴家立业呢？”
{Gen 30:31} He said, "What shall I give you?" Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it:
{Gen 30:31} 拉班说：“我当给你什么呢？”雅各说：“什么你也不必给我，只有一件事，你若应承，我便仍旧牧放你的羊群。
{Gen 30:32} let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and they shall be my wages.
{Gen 30:32} 今天我要走遍你的羊群，把绵羊中凡有点的、有斑的，和黑色的，并山羊中凡有斑的、有点的，都挑出来；将来这一等的就算我的工价。
{Gen 30:33} So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen."
{Gen 30:33} 以后你来查看我的工价，凡在我手里的山羊不是有点有斑的，绵羊不是黑色的，那就算是我偷的；这样便可证出我的公义来。”
{Gen 30:34} Laban said, "Good! Let it be as you have said."
{Gen 30:34} 拉班说：“好啊！我情愿照着你的话行。”
{Gen 30:35} But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in the charge of his sons.
{Gen 30:35} 当日，拉班把有纹的、有斑的公山羊，有点的、有斑的、有杂白纹的母山羊，并黑色的绵羊，都挑出来，交在他儿子们的手下，
{Gen 30:36} And he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban's flock.
{Gen 30:36} 又使自己和雅各相离三天的路程。雅各就牧养拉班其余的羊。
{Gen 30:37} Then Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the sticks.
{Gen 30:37} 雅各拿杨树、杏树、枫树的嫩枝，将皮剥成白纹，使枝子露出白的来，
{Gen 30:38} He set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,
{Gen 30:38} 将剥了皮的枝子，对着羊群，插在饮羊的水沟里和水槽里，羊来喝的时候，牝牡配合。
{Gen 30:39} the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.
{Gen 30:39} 羊对着枝子配合，就生下有纹的、有点的、有斑的来。
{Gen 30:40} And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban's flock.
{Gen 30:40} 雅各把羊羔分出来，使拉班的羊与这有纹和黑色的羊相对，把自己的羊另放一处，不叫他和拉班的羊混杂。
{Gen 30:41} Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks,
{Gen 30:41} 到羊群肥壮配合的时候，雅各就把枝子插在水沟里，使羊对着枝子配合。
{Gen 30:42} but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
{Gen 30:42} 只是到羊瘦弱配合的时候就不插枝子。这样，瘦弱的就归拉班，肥壮的就归雅各。
{Gen 30:43} Thus the man increased greatly and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
{Gen 30:43} 于是雅各极其发大，得了许多的羊群、仆婢、骆驼，和驴。
{Gen 31:1}  Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, "Jacob has taken all that was our father's, and from what was our father's he has gained all this wealth."
{Gen 31:1}  雅各听见拉班的儿子们有话说：“雅各把我们父亲所有的都夺了去，并藉着我们父亲的，得了这一切的荣耀（或作：财）。”
{Gen 31:2}  And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.
{Gen 31:2}  雅各见拉班的气色向他不如从前了。
{Gen 31:3}  Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you."
{Gen 31:3}  耶和华对雅各说：“你要回你祖、你父之地，到你亲族那里去，我必与你同在。”
{Gen 31:4}  So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was
{Gen 31:4}  雅各就打发人，叫拉结和利亚到田野羊群那里来，
{Gen 31:5}  and said to them, "I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me.
{Gen 31:5}  对他们说：“我看你们父亲的气色向我不如从前了；但我父亲的神向来与我同在。
{Gen 31:6}  You know that I have served your father with all my strength,
{Gen 31:6}  你们也知道，我尽了我的力量服事你们的父亲。
{Gen 31:7}  yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not permit him to harm me.
{Gen 31:7}  你们的父亲欺哄我，十次改了我的工价；然而神不容他害我。
{Gen 31:8}  If he said, 'The spotted shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped.
{Gen 31:8}  他若说：‘有点的归你作工价’，羊群所生的都有点；他若说：‘有纹的归你作工价’，羊群所生的都有纹。
{Gen 31:9}  Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.
{Gen 31:9}  这样，神把你们父亲的牲畜夺来赐给我了。
{Gen 31:10} In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled.
{Gen 31:10} 羊配合的时候，我梦中举目一看，见跳母羊的公羊都是有纹的、有点的、有花斑的。
{Gen 31:11} Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am!'
{Gen 31:11} 神的使者在那梦中呼叫我说：‘雅各。’我说：‘我在这里。’
{Gen 31:12} And he said, 'Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.
{Gen 31:12} 他说：‘你举目观看，跳母羊的公羊都是有纹的、有点的、有花斑的；凡拉班向你所做的，我都看见了。
{Gen 31:13} I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred.'"
{Gen 31:13} 我是伯特利的神；你在那里用油浇过柱子，向我许过愿。现今你起来，离开这地，回你本地去吧！’”
{Gen 31:14} Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, "Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?
{Gen 31:14} 拉结和利亚回答雅各说：“在我们父亲的家里还有我们可得的分吗？还有我们的产业吗？
{Gen 31:15} Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money.
{Gen 31:15} 我们不是被他当作外人吗？因为他卖了我们，吞了我们的价值。
{Gen 31:16} All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."
{Gen 31:16} 神从我们父亲所夺出来的一切财物，那就是我们和我们孩子们的。现今凡神所吩咐你的，你只管去行吧！”
{Gen 31:17} So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.
{Gen 31:17} 雅各起来，使他的儿子和妻子都骑上骆驼，
{Gen 31:18} He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.
{Gen 31:18} 又带着他在巴但亚兰所得的一切牲畜和财物，往迦南地、他父亲以撒那里去了。
{Gen 31:19} Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods.
{Gen 31:19} 当时拉班剪羊毛去了，拉结偷了他父亲家中的神像。
{Gen 31:20} And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he intended to flee.
{Gen 31:20} 雅各背着亚兰人拉班偷走了，并不告诉他，
{Gen 31:21} He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
{Gen 31:21} 就带着所有的逃跑。他起身过大河，面向基列山行去。
{Gen 31:22} When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,
{Gen 31:22} 到第三日，有人告诉拉班，雅各逃跑了。
{Gen 31:23} he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.
{Gen 31:23} 拉班带领他的众弟兄去追赶，追了七日，在基列山就追上了。
{Gen 31:24} But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."
{Gen 31:24} 夜间，神到亚兰人拉班那里，在梦中对他说：“你要小心，不可与雅各说好说歹。”
{Gen 31:25} And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead.
{Gen 31:25} 拉班追上雅各。雅各在山上支搭帐棚；拉班和他的众弟兄也在基列山上支搭帐棚。
{Gen 31:26} And Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword?
{Gen 31:26} 拉班对雅各说：“你做的是什么事呢？你背着我偷走了，又把我的女儿们带了去，如同用刀剑掳去的一般。
{Gen 31:27} Why did you flee secretly and trick me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre?
{Gen 31:27} 你为什么暗暗的逃跑，偷着走，并不告诉我，叫我可以欢乐、唱歌、击鼓、弹琴地送你回去？
{Gen 31:28} And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly.
{Gen 31:28} 又不容我与外孙和女儿亲嘴？你所行的真是愚昧！
{Gen 31:29} It is in my power to do you harm. But the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'
{Gen 31:29} 我手中原有能力害你，只是你父亲的神昨夜对我说：‘你要小心，不可与雅各说好说歹。’
{Gen 31:30} And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house, but why did you steal my gods?"
{Gen 31:30} 现在你虽然想你父家，不得不去，为什么又偷了我的神像呢？”
{Gen 31:31} Jacob answered and said to Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.
{Gen 31:31} 雅各回答拉班说：“恐怕你把你的女儿从我夺去，所以我逃跑。
{Gen 31:32} Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
{Gen 31:32} 至于你的神像，你在谁那里搜出来，就不容谁存活。当着我们的众弟兄，你认一认，在我这里有什么东西是你的，就拿去。”原来雅各不知道拉结偷了那些神像。
{Gen 31:33} So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's.
{Gen 31:33} 拉班进了雅各、利亚，并两个使女的帐棚，都没有搜出来，就从利亚的帐棚出来，进了拉结的帐棚。
{Gen 31:34} Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle and sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them.
{Gen 31:34} 拉结已经把神像藏在骆驼的驮篓里，便坐在上头。拉班摸遍了那帐棚，并没有摸着。
{Gen 31:35} And she said to her father, "Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me." So he searched but did not find the household gods.
{Gen 31:35} 拉结对他父亲说：“现在我身上不便，不能在你面前起来，求我主不要生气。”这样，拉班搜寻神像，竟没有搜出来。
{Gen 31:36} Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, "What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?
{Gen 31:36} 雅各就发怒斥责拉班说：“我有什么过犯，有什么罪恶，你竟这样火速地追我？
{Gen 31:37} For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.
{Gen 31:37} 你摸遍了我一切的家具，你搜出什么来呢？可以放在你我弟兄面前，叫他们在你我中间辨别辨别。
{Gen 31:38} These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.
{Gen 31:38} 我在你家这二十年，你的母绵羊、母山羊没有掉过胎。你群中的公羊，我没有吃过；
{Gen 31:39} What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
{Gen 31:39} 被野兽撕裂的，我没有带来给你，是我自己赔上。无论是白日，是黑夜，被偷去的，你都向我索要。
{Gen 31:40} There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
{Gen 31:40} 我白日受尽干热，黑夜受尽寒霜，不得合眼睡着，我常是这样。
{Gen 31:41} These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
{Gen 31:41} 我这二十年在你家里，为你的两个女儿服事你十四年，为你的羊群服事你六年，你又十次改了我的工价。
{Gen 31:42} If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night."
{Gen 31:42} 若不是我父亲以撒所敬畏的神，就是亚伯拉罕的神与我同在，你如今必定打发我空手而去。神看见我的苦情和我的劳碌，就在昨夜责备你。”
{Gen 31:43} Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne?
{Gen 31:43} 拉班回答雅各说：“这女儿是我的女儿，这些孩子是我的孩子，这些羊群也是我的羊群；凡在你眼前的都是我的。我的女儿并他们所生的孩子，我今日能向他们做什么呢？
{Gen 31:44} Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me."
{Gen 31:44} 来吧！你我二人可以立约，作你我中间的证据。”
{Gen 31:45} So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
{Gen 31:45} 雅各就拿一块石头立作柱子，
{Gen 31:46} And Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones." And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
{Gen 31:46} 又对众弟兄说：“你们堆聚石头。”他们就拿石头来堆成一堆，大家便在旁边吃喝。
{Gen 31:47} Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
{Gen 31:47} 拉班称那石堆为伊迦尔撒哈杜他，雅各却称那石堆为迦累得（都是以石堆为证的意思）。
{Gen 31:48} Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." Therefore he named it Galeed,
{Gen 31:48} 拉班说：“今日这石堆作你我中间的证据。”因此这地方名叫迦累得，
{Gen 31:49} and Mizpah, for he said, "The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight.
{Gen 31:49} 又叫米斯巴，意思说：“我们彼此离别以后，愿耶和华在你我中间鉴察。
{Gen 31:50} If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me."
{Gen 31:50} 你若苦待我的女儿，又在我的女儿以外另娶妻，虽没有人知道，却有神在你我中间作见证。”
{Gen 31:51} Then Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me.
{Gen 31:51} 拉班又说：“你看我在你我中间所立的这石堆和柱子。
{Gen 31:52} This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm.
{Gen 31:52} 这石堆作证据，这柱子也作证据。我必不过这石堆去害你；你也不可过这石堆和柱子来害我。
{Gen 31:53} The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,
{Gen 31:53} 但愿亚伯拉罕的神和拿鹤的神，就是他们父亲的神，在你我中间判断。”雅各就指着他父亲以撒所敬畏的神起誓，
{Gen 31:54} and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country.
{Gen 31:54} 又在山上献祭，请众弟兄来吃饭。他们吃了饭，便在山上住宿。
{Gen 31:55} Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned home.
{Gen 31:55} 拉班清早起来，与他外孙和女儿亲嘴，给他们祝福，回往自己的地方去了。
{Gen 32:1}  Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
{Gen 32:1}  雅各仍旧行路，神的使者遇见他。
{Gen 32:2}  And when Jacob saw them he said, "This is God's camp!" So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
{Gen 32:2}  雅各看见他们就说：“这是神的军兵”，于是给那地方起名叫玛哈念（就是二军兵的意思）。
{Gen 32:3}  And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,
{Gen 32:3}  雅各打发人先往西珥地去，就是以东地，见他哥哥以扫，
{Gen 32:4}  instructing them, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, 'I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now.
{Gen 32:4}  吩咐他们说：“你们对我主以扫说：‘你的仆人雅各这样说：我在拉班那里寄居，直到如今。
{Gen 32:5}  I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.'"
{Gen 32:5}  我有牛、驴、羊群、仆婢，现在打发人来报告我主，为要在你眼前蒙恩。’”
{Gen 32:6}  And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him."
{Gen 32:6}  所打发的人回到雅各那里，说：“我们到了你哥哥以扫那里，他带着四百人，正迎着你来。”
{Gen 32:7}  Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps,
{Gen 32:7}  雅各就甚惧怕，而且愁烦，便把那与他同在的人口和羊群、牛群、骆驼分做两队，
{Gen 32:8}  thinking, "If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape."
{Gen 32:8}  说：“以扫若来击杀这一队，剩下的那一队还可以逃避。”
{Gen 32:9}  And Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,'
{Gen 32:9}  雅各说：“耶和华我祖亚伯拉罕的神，我父亲以撒的神啊，你曾对我说：‘回你本地本族去，我要厚待你。’
{Gen 32:10} I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
{Gen 32:10} 你向仆人所施的一切慈爱和诚实，我一点也不配得；我先前只拿着我的杖过这约但河，如今我却成了两队了。
{Gen 32:11} Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children.
{Gen 32:11} 求你救我脱离我哥哥以扫的手；因为我怕他来杀我，连妻子带儿女一同杀了。
{Gen 32:12} But you said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'"
{Gen 32:12} 你曾说：‘我必定厚待你，使你的后裔如同海边的沙，多得不可胜数。’”
{Gen 32:13} So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau,
{Gen 32:13} 当夜，雅各在那里住宿，就从他所有的物中拿礼物要送给他哥哥以扫：
{Gen 32:14} two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
{Gen 32:14} 母山羊二百只，公山羊二十只，母绵羊二百只，公绵羊二十只，
{Gen 32:15} thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
{Gen 32:15} 奶崽子的骆驼三十只，各带着崽子，母牛四十只，公牛十只，母驴二十匹，驴驹十匹；
{Gen 32:16} These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove."
{Gen 32:16} 每样各分一群，交在仆人手下，就对仆人说：“你们要在我前头过去，使群群相离，有空闲的地方”；
{Gen 32:17} He instructed the first, "When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, 'To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?'
{Gen 32:17} 又吩咐尽先走的说：“我哥哥以扫遇见你的时候，问你说：‘你是那家的人？要往那里去？你前头这些是谁的？’
{Gen 32:18} then you shall say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is behind us.'"
{Gen 32:18} 你就说：‘是你仆人雅各的，是送给我主以扫的礼物；他自己也在我们后边。’”
{Gen 32:19} He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, "You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him,
{Gen 32:19} 又吩咐第二、第三，和一切赶群畜的人说：“你们遇见以扫的时候也要这样对他说；
{Gen 32:20} and you shall say, 'Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.'" For he thought, "I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."
{Gen 32:20} 并且你们要说：‘你仆人雅各在我们后边。’”因雅各心里说：“我藉着在我前头去的礼物解他的恨，然后再见他的面，或者他容纳我。”
{Gen 32:21} So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.
{Gen 32:21} 于是礼物先过去了；那夜，雅各在队中住宿。
{Gen 32:22} The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
{Gen 32:22} 他夜间起来，带着两个妻子，两个使女，并十一个儿子，都过了雅博渡口，
{Gen 32:23} He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had.
{Gen 32:23} 先打发他们过河，又打发所有的都过去，
{Gen 32:24} And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
{Gen 32:24} 只剩下雅各一人。有一个人来和他摔跤，直到黎明。
{Gen 32:25} When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
{Gen 32:25} 那人见自己胜不过他，就将他的大腿窝摸了一把，雅各的大腿窝正在摔跤的时候就扭了。
{Gen 32:26} Then he said, "Let me go, for the day has broken." But Jacob said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
{Gen 32:26} 那人说：“天黎明了，容我去吧！”雅各说：“你不给我祝福，我就不容你去。”
{Gen 32:27} And he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob."
{Gen 32:27} 那人说：“你名叫什么？”他说：“我名叫雅各。”
{Gen 32:28} Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed."
{Gen 32:28} 那人说：“你的名不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列；因为你与神与人较力，都得了胜。”
{Gen 32:29} Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And there he blessed him.
{Gen 32:29} 雅各问他说：“请将你的名告诉我。”那人说：“何必问我的名？”于是在那里给雅各祝福。
{Gen 32:30} So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered."
{Gen 32:30} 雅各便给那地方起名叫毗努伊勒（就是神之面的意思），意思说：“我面对面见了神，我的性命仍得保全。”
{Gen 32:31} The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip.
{Gen 32:31} 日头刚出来的时候，雅各经过毗努伊勒，他的大腿就瘸了。
{Gen 32:32} Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the sinew of the thigh.
{Gen 32:32} 故此，以色列人不吃大腿窝的筋，直到今日，因为那人摸了雅各大腿窝的筋。
{Gen 33:1}  And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants.
{Gen 33:1}  雅各举目观看，见以扫来了，后头跟着四百人，他就把孩子们分开交给利亚、拉结，和两个使女，
{Gen 33:2}  And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.
{Gen 33:2}  并且叫两个使女和他们的孩子在前头，利亚和他的孩子在后头，拉结和约瑟在尽后头。
{Gen 33:3}  He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
{Gen 33:3}  他自己在他们前头过去，一连七次俯伏在地才就近他哥哥。
{Gen 33:4}  But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
{Gen 33:4}  以扫跑来迎接他，将他抱住，又搂着他的颈项，与他亲嘴，两个人就哭了。
{Gen 33:5}  And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, "Who are these with you?" Jacob said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."
{Gen 33:5}  以扫举目看见妇人孩子，就说：“这些和你同行的是谁呢？”雅各说：“这些孩子是神施恩给你的仆人的。”
{Gen 33:6}  Then the servants drew near, they and their children, and bowed down.
{Gen 33:6}  于是两个使女和他们的孩子前来下拜；
{Gen 33:7}  Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down.
{Gen 33:7}  利亚和他的孩子也前来下拜；随后约瑟和拉结也前来下拜。
{Gen 33:8}  Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company that I met?" Jacob answered, "To find favor in the sight of my lord."
{Gen 33:8}  以扫说：“我所遇见的这些群畜是什么意思呢？”雅各说：“是要在我主面前蒙恩的。”
{Gen 33:9}  But Esau said, "I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself."
{Gen 33:9}  以扫说：“兄弟啊，我的已经够了，你的仍归你吧！”
{Gen 33:10} Jacob said, "No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand. For I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me.
{Gen 33:10} 雅各说：“不然，我若在你眼前蒙恩，就求你从我手里收下这礼物；因为我见了你的面，如同见了神的面，并且你容纳了我。
{Gen 33:11} Please accept my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." Thus he urged him, and he took it.
{Gen 33:11} 求你收下我带来给你的礼物；因为神恩待我，使我充足。”雅各再三的求他，他才收下了。
{Gen 33:12} Then Esau said, "Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of you."
{Gen 33:12} 以扫说：“我们可以起身前往，我在你前头走。”
{Gen 33:13} But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flocks will die.
{Gen 33:13} 雅各对他说：“我主知道孩子们年幼娇嫩，牛羊也正在乳养的时候，若是催赶一天，群畜都必死了。
{Gen 33:14} Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."
{Gen 33:14} 求我主在仆人前头走，我要量着在我面前群畜和孩子的力量慢慢地前行，直走到西珥我主那里。”
{Gen 33:15} So Esau said, "Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me." But he said, "What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."
{Gen 33:15} 以扫说：“容我把跟随我的人留几个在你这里。”雅各说：“何必呢？只要在我主眼前蒙恩就是了。”
{Gen 33:16} So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
{Gen 33:16} 于是，以扫当日起行，回往西珥去了。
{Gen 33:17} But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
{Gen 33:17} 雅各就往疏割去，在那里为自己盖造房屋，又为牲畜搭棚；因此那地方名叫疏割（就是棚的意思）。
{Gen 33:18} And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram, and he camped before the city.
{Gen 33:18} 雅各从巴但亚兰回来的时候，平平安安的到了迦南地的示剑城，在城东支搭帐棚，
{Gen 33:19} And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, he bought for a hundred pieces of money the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent.
{Gen 33:19} 就用一百块银子向示剑的父亲、哈抹的子孙买了支帐棚的那块地，
{Gen 33:20} There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
{Gen 33:20} 在那里筑了一座坛，起名叫伊利伊罗伊以色列（就是神、以色列神的意思）。
{Gen 34:1}  Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the women of the land.
{Gen 34:1}  利亚给雅各所生的女儿底拿出去，要见那地的女子们。
{Gen 34:2}  And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her.
{Gen 34:2}  那地的主希未人、哈抹的儿子示剑看见他，就拉住他，与他行淫，玷辱他。
{Gen 34:3}  And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.
{Gen 34:3}  示剑的心系恋雅各的女儿底拿，喜爱这女子，甜言蜜语地安慰他。
{Gen 34:4}  So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, "Get me this girl for my wife."
{Gen 34:4}  示剑对他父亲哈抹说：“求你为我聘这女子为妻。”
{Gen 34:5}  Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came.
{Gen 34:5}  雅各听见示剑玷污了他的女儿底拿。那时他的儿子们正和群畜在田野，雅各就闭口不言，等他们回来。
{Gen 34:6}  And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
{Gen 34:6}  示剑的父亲哈抹出来见雅各，要和他商议。
{Gen 34:7}  The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing must not be done.
{Gen 34:7}  雅各的儿子们听见这事，就从田野回来，人人忿恨，十分恼怒；因示剑在以色列家做了丑事，与雅各的女儿行淫，这本是不该做的事。
{Gen 34:8}  But Hamor spoke with them, saying, "The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him to be his wife.
{Gen 34:8}  哈抹和他们商议说：“我儿子示剑的心恋慕这女子，求你们将他给我的儿子为妻。
{Gen 34:9}  Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
{Gen 34:9}  你们与我们彼此结亲；你们可以把女儿给我们，也可以娶我们的女儿。
{Gen 34:10} You shall dwell with us, and the land shall be open to you. Dwell and trade in it, and get property in it."
{Gen 34:10} 你们与我们同住吧！这地都在你们面前，只管在此居住，做买卖，置产业。”
{Gen 34:11} Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.
{Gen 34:11} 示剑对女儿的父亲和弟兄们说：“但愿我在你们眼前蒙恩，你们向我要什么，我必给你们。
{Gen 34:12} Ask me for as great a bride price and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me. Only give me the young woman to be my wife."
{Gen 34:12} 任凭向我要多重的聘金和礼物，我必照你们所说的给你们；只要把女子给我为妻。”
{Gen 34:13} The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.
{Gen 34:13} 雅各的儿子们因为示剑玷污了他们的妹子底拿，就用诡诈的话回答示剑和他父亲哈抹，
{Gen 34:14} They said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.
{Gen 34:14} 对他们说：“我们不能把我们的妹子给没有受割礼的人为妻，因为那是我们的羞辱。
{Gen 34:15} Only on this condition will we agree with you--that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised.
{Gen 34:15} 惟有一件才可以应允：若你们所有的男丁都受割礼，和我们一样，
{Gen 34:16} Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people.
{Gen 34:16} 我们就把女儿给你们，也娶你们的女儿；我们便与你们同住，两下成为一样的人民。
{Gen 34:17} But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone."
{Gen 34:17} 倘若你们不听从我们受割礼，我们就带着妹子走了。”
{Gen 34:18} Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor's son Shechem.
{Gen 34:18} 哈抹和他的儿子示剑喜欢这话。
{Gen 34:19} And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his father's house.
{Gen 34:19} 那少年人做这事并不迟延，因为他喜爱雅各的女儿；他在他父亲家中也是人最尊重的。
{Gen 34:20} So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
{Gen 34:20} 哈抹和他儿子示剑到本城的门口，对本城的人说：
{Gen 34:21} "These men are at peace with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give them our daughters.
{Gen 34:21} “这些人与我们和睦，不如许他们在这地居住，做买卖；这地也宽阔，足可容下他们。我们可以娶他们的女儿为妻，也可以把我们的女儿嫁给他们。
{Gen 34:22} Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us to become one people--when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised.
{Gen 34:22} 惟有一件事我们必须做，他们才肯应允和我们同住，成为一样的人民：就是我们中间所有的男丁都要受割礼，和他们一样。
{Gen 34:23} Will not their livestock, their property and all their beasts be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us."
{Gen 34:23} 他们的群畜、货财，和一切的牲口岂不都归我们吗？只要依从他们，他们就与我们同住。”
{Gen 34:24} And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
{Gen 34:24} 凡从城门出入的人就都听从哈抹和他儿子示剑的话；于是凡从城门出入的男丁都受了割礼。
{Gen 34:25} On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came against the city while it felt secure and killed all the males.
{Gen 34:25} 到第三天，众人正在疼痛的时候，雅各的两个儿子，就是底拿的哥哥西缅和利未，各拿刀剑，趁着众人想不到的时候来到城中，把一切男丁都杀了，
{Gen 34:26} They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem's house and went away.
{Gen 34:26} 又用刀杀了哈抹和他儿子示剑，把底拿从示剑家里带出来就走了。
{Gen 34:27} The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
{Gen 34:27} 雅各的儿子们因为他们的妹子受了玷污，就来到被杀的人那里，掳掠那城，
{Gen 34:28} They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.
{Gen 34:28} 夺了他们的羊群、牛群，和驴，并城里田间所有的；
{Gen 34:29} All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered.
{Gen 34:29} 又把他们一切货财、孩子、妇女，并各房中所有的，都掳掠去了。
{Gen 34:30} Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household."
{Gen 34:30} 雅各对西缅和利未说：“你们连累我，使我在这地的居民中，就是在迦南人和比利洗人中，有了臭名。我的人丁既然稀少，他们必聚集来击杀我，我和全家的人都必灭绝。”
{Gen 34:31} But they said, "Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?"
{Gen 34:31} 他们说：“他岂可待我们的妹子如同妓女吗？”
{Gen 35:1}  God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."
{Gen 35:1}  神对雅各说：“起来！上伯特利去，住在那里；要在那里筑一座坛给神，就是你逃避你哥哥以扫的时候向你显现的那位。”
{Gen 35:2}  So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments.
{Gen 35:2}  雅各就对他家中的人并一切与他同在的人说：“你们要除掉你们中间的外邦神，也要自洁，更换衣裳。
{Gen 35:3}  Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone."
{Gen 35:3}  我们要起来，上伯特利去，在那里我要筑一座坛给神，就是在我遭难的日子应允我的祷告、在我行的路上保佑我的那位。”
{Gen 35:4}  So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem.
{Gen 35:4}  他们就把外邦人的神像和他们耳朵上的环子交给雅各；雅各都藏在示剑那里的橡树底下。
{Gen 35:5}  And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
{Gen 35:5}  他们便起行前往。神使那周围城邑的人都甚惊惧，就不追赶雅各的众子了。
{Gen 35:6}  And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,
{Gen 35:6}  于是雅各和一切与他同在的人到了迦南地的路斯，就是伯特利。
{Gen 35:7}  and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.
{Gen 35:7}  他在那里筑了一座坛，就给那地方起名叫伊勒伯特利（就是伯特利之神的意思）；因为他逃避他哥哥的时候，神在那里向他显现。
{Gen 35:8}  And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth.
{Gen 35:8}  利百加的奶母底波拉死了，就葬在伯特利下边橡树底下；那棵树名叫亚伦巴古。
{Gen 35:9}  God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
{Gen 35:9}  雅各从巴但亚兰回来，神又向他显现，赐福与他，
{Gen 35:10} And God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name." So he called his name Israel.
{Gen 35:10} 且对他说：“你的名原是雅各，从今以后不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列。”这样，他就改名叫以色列。
{Gen 35:11} And God said to him, "I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body.
{Gen 35:11} 神又对他说：“我是全能的神；你要生养众多，将来有一族和多国的民从你而生，又有君王从你而出。
{Gen 35:12} The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you."
{Gen 35:12} 我所赐给亚伯拉罕和以撒的地，我要赐给你与你的后裔。”
{Gen 35:13} Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.
{Gen 35:13} 神就从那与雅各说话的地方升上去了。
{Gen 35:14} And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.
{Gen 35:14} 雅各便在那里立了一根石柱，在柱子上奠酒，浇油。
{Gen 35:15} So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
{Gen 35:15} 雅各就给那地方起名叫伯特利。
{Gen 35:16} Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor.
{Gen 35:16} 他们从伯特利起行，离以法他还有一段路程，拉结临产甚是艰难。
{Gen 35:17} And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, "Do not fear, for you have another son."
{Gen 35:17} 正在艰难的时候，收生婆对他说：“不要怕，你又要得一个儿子了。”
{Gen 35:18} And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
{Gen 35:18} 他将近于死，灵魂要走的时候，就给他儿子起名叫便俄尼；他父亲却给他起名叫便雅悯。
{Gen 35:19} So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),
{Gen 35:19} 拉结死了，葬在以法他的路旁；以法他就是伯利恒。
{Gen 35:20} and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day.
{Gen 35:20} 雅各在他的坟上立了一统碑，就是拉结的墓碑，到今日还在。
{Gen 35:21} Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
{Gen 35:21} 以色列起行前往，在以得台那边支搭帐棚。
{Gen 35:22} While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. And Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
{Gen 35:22} 以色列住在那地的时候，流便去与他父亲的妾辟拉同寝，以色列也听见了。雅各共有十二个儿子。
{Gen 35:23} The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
{Gen 35:23} 利亚所生的是雅各的长子流便，还有西缅、利未、犹大、以萨迦、西布伦。
{Gen 35:24} The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
{Gen 35:24} 拉结所生的是约瑟、便雅悯。
{Gen 35:25} The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali.
{Gen 35:25} 拉结的使女辟拉所生的是但、拿弗他利。
{Gen 35:26} The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
{Gen 35:26} 利亚的使女悉帕所生的是迦得、亚设。这是雅各在巴但亚兰所生的儿子。
{Gen 35:27} And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
{Gen 35:27} 雅各来到他父亲以撒那里，到了基列亚巴的幔利，乃是亚伯拉罕和以撒寄居的地方；基列亚巴就是希伯仑。
{Gen 35:28} Now the days of Isaac were 180 years.
{Gen 35:28} 以撒共活了一百八十岁。
{Gen 35:29} And Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
{Gen 35:29} 以撒年纪老迈，日子满足，气绝而死，归到他列祖（原文作本民）那里。他两个儿子以扫、雅各把他埋葬了。
{Gen 36:1}  These are the generations of Esau (that is, Edom).
{Gen 36:1}  以扫就是以东，他的后代记在下面。
{Gen 36:2}  Esau took his wives from the Canaanites: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
{Gen 36:2}  以扫娶迦南的女子为妻，就是赫人以伦的女儿亚大和希未人祭便的孙女、亚拿的女儿阿何利巴玛，
{Gen 36:3}  and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth.
{Gen 36:3}  又娶了以实玛利的女儿、尼拜约的妹子巴实抹。
{Gen 36:4}  And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; Basemath bore Reuel;
{Gen 36:4}  亚大给以扫生了以利法；巴实抹生了流珥；

{Gen 37:1}  Jacob lived in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
{Gen 37:1}  雅各住在迦南地，就是他父亲寄居的地。
{Gen 37:2}  These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father.
{Gen 37:2}  雅各的记略如下。约瑟十七岁与他哥哥们一同牧羊。他是个童子，与他父亲的妾辟拉、悉帕的儿子们常在一处。约瑟将他哥哥们的恶行报给他们的父亲。
{Gen 37:3}  Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors.
{Gen 37:3}  以色列原来爱约瑟过于爱他的众子，因为约瑟是他年老生的；他给约瑟做了一件彩衣。
{Gen 37:4}  But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.
{Gen 37:4}  约瑟的哥哥们见父亲爱约瑟过于爱他们，就恨约瑟，不与他说和睦的话。
{Gen 37:5}  Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more.
{Gen 37:5}  约瑟做了一梦，告诉他哥哥们，他们就越发恨他。
{Gen 37:6}  He said to them, "Hear this dream that I have dreamed:
{Gen 37:6}  约瑟对他们说：“请听我所做的梦：
{Gen 37:7}  Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf."
{Gen 37:7}  我们在田里捆禾稼，我的捆起来站着，你们的捆来围着我的捆下拜。”
{Gen 37:8}  His brothers said to him, "Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?" So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
{Gen 37:8}  他的哥哥们回答说：“难道你真要作我们的王吗？难道你真要管辖我们吗？”他们就因为他的梦和他的话越发恨他。
{Gen 37:9}  Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, "Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
{Gen 37:9}  后来他又做了一梦，也告诉他的哥哥们说：“看哪，我又做了一梦，梦见太阳、月亮，与十一个星向我下拜。”
{Gen 37:10} But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?"
{Gen 37:10} 约瑟将这梦告诉他父亲和他哥哥们，他父亲就责备他说：“你做的这是什么梦！难道我和你母亲、你弟兄果然要来俯伏在地，向你下拜吗？”
{Gen 37:11} And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.
{Gen 37:11} 他哥哥们都嫉妒他，他父亲却把这话存在心里。
{Gen 37:12} Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem.
{Gen 37:12} 约瑟的哥哥们往示剑去放他们父亲的羊。
{Gen 37:13} And Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them." And he said to him, "Here I am."
{Gen 37:13} 以色列对约瑟说：“你哥哥们不是在示剑放羊吗？你来，我要打发你往他们那里去。”约瑟说：“我在这里。”
{Gen 37:14} So he said to him, "Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word." So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
{Gen 37:14} 以色列说：“你去看看你哥哥们平安不平安，群羊平安不平安，就回来报信给我”；于是打发他出希伯仑谷，他就往示剑去了。
{Gen 37:15} And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, "What are you seeking?"
{Gen 37:15} 有人遇见他在田野走迷了路，就问他说：“你找什么？”
{Gen 37:16} "I am seeking my brothers," he said. "Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock."
{Gen 37:16} 他说：“我找我的哥哥们，求你告诉我，他们在何处放羊。”
{Gen 37:17} And the man said, "They have gone away, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
{Gen 37:17} 那人说：“他们已经走了，我听见他们说要往多坍去。”约瑟就去追赶他哥哥们，遇见他们在多坍。
{Gen 37:18} They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him.
{Gen 37:18} 他们远远的看见他，趁他还没有走到跟前，大家就同谋要害死他，
{Gen 37:19} They said to one another, "Here comes this dreamer.
{Gen 37:19} 彼此说：“你看！那做梦的来了。
{Gen 37:20} Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him, and we will see what will become of his dreams."
{Gen 37:20} 来吧！我们将他杀了，丢在一个坑里，就说有恶兽把他吃了。我们且看他的梦将来怎么样。”
{Gen 37:21} But when Reuben heard it, he rescued him out of their hands, saying, "Let us not take his life."
{Gen 37:21} 流便听见了，要救他脱离他们的手，说：“我们不可害他的性命”；
{Gen 37:22} And Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him"--that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father.
{Gen 37:22} 又说：“不可流他的血，可以把他丢在这野地的坑里，不可下手害他。”流便的意思是要救他脱离他们的手，把他归还他的父亲。
{Gen 37:23} So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the robe of many colors that he wore.
{Gen 37:23} 约瑟到了他哥哥们那里，他们就剥了他的外衣，就是他穿的那件彩衣，
{Gen 37:24} And they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.
{Gen 37:24} 把他丢在坑里；那坑是空的，里头没有水。
{Gen 37:25} Then they sat down to eat. And looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.
{Gen 37:25} 他们坐下吃饭，举目观看，见有一夥米甸的以实玛利人从基列来，用骆驼驮着香料、乳香、没药，要带下埃及去。
{Gen 37:26} Then Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
{Gen 37:26} 犹大对众弟兄说：“我们杀我们的兄弟，藏了他的血有什么益处呢？
{Gen 37:27} Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh." And his brothers listened to him.
{Gen 37:27} 我们不如将他卖给以实玛利人，不可下手害他；因为他是我们的兄弟，我们的骨肉。”众弟兄就听从了他。
{Gen 37:28} Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.
{Gen 37:28} 有些米甸的商人从那里经过，哥哥们就把约瑟从坑里拉上来，讲定二十舍客勒银子，把约瑟卖给以实玛利人。他们就把约瑟带到埃及去了。
{Gen 37:29} When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes
{Gen 37:29} 流便回到坑边，见约瑟不在坑里，就撕裂衣服，
{Gen 37:30} and returned to his brothers and said, "The boy is gone, and I, where shall I go?"
{Gen 37:30} 回到兄弟们那里，说：“童子没有了。我往那里去才好呢？”
{Gen 37:31} Then they took Joseph's robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
{Gen 37:31} 他们宰了一只公山羊，把约瑟的那件彩衣染了血，
{Gen 37:32} And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said, "This we have found; please identify whether it is your son's robe or not."
{Gen 37:32} 打发人送到他们的父亲那里，说：“我们捡了这个；请认一认是你儿子的外衣不是？”
{Gen 37:33} And he identified it and said, "It is my son's robe. A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces."
{Gen 37:33} 他认得，就说：“这是我儿子的外衣。有恶兽把他吃了，约瑟被撕碎了！撕碎了！”
{Gen 37:34} Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.
{Gen 37:34} 雅各便撕裂衣服，腰间围上麻布，为他儿子悲哀了多日。
{Gen 37:35} All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, "No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning." Thus his father wept for him.
{Gen 37:35} 他的儿女都起来安慰他，他却不肯受安慰，说：“我必悲哀着下阴间，到我儿子那里。”约瑟的父亲就为他哀哭。
{Gen 37:36} Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.
{Gen 37:36} 米甸人带约瑟到埃及，把他卖给法老的内臣护卫长波提乏。
{Gen 38:1}  It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and turned aside to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
{Gen 38:1}  那时，犹大离开他弟兄下去，到一个亚杜兰人名叫希拉的家里去。
{Gen 38:2}  There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her and went in to her,
{Gen 38:2}  犹大在那里看见一个迦南人名叫书亚的女儿，就娶他为妻，与他同房，
{Gen 38:3}  and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.
{Gen 38:3}  他就怀孕生了儿子，犹大给他起名叫珥。
{Gen 38:4}  She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
{Gen 38:4}  他又怀孕生了儿子，母亲给他起名叫俄南。
{Gen 38:5}  Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. Judah was in Chezib when she bore him.
{Gen 38:5}  他复又生了儿子，给他起名叫示拉。他生示拉的时候，犹大正在基悉。
{Gen 38:6}  And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
{Gen 38:6}  犹大为长子珥娶妻，名叫他玛。
{Gen 38:7}  But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death.
{Gen 38:7}  犹大的长子珥在耶和华眼中看为恶，耶和华就叫他死了。
{Gen 38:8}  Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother."
{Gen 38:8}  犹大对俄南说：“你当与你哥哥的妻子同房，向他尽你为弟的本分，为你哥哥生子立后。”
{Gen 38:9}  But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother's wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother.
{Gen 38:9}  俄南知道生子不归自己，所以同房的时候便遗在地，免得给他哥哥留后。
{Gen 38:10} And what he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also.
{Gen 38:10} 俄南所做的在耶和华眼中看为恶，耶和华也就叫他死了。
{Gen 38:11} Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up"--for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and remained in her father's house.
{Gen 38:11} 犹大心里说：“恐怕示拉也死，像他两个哥哥一样”，就对他儿妇他玛说：“你去，在你父亲家里守寡，等我儿子示拉长大。”他玛就回去，住在他父亲家里。
{Gen 38:12} In the course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died. When Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
{Gen 38:12} 过了许久，犹大的妻子书亚的女儿死了。犹大得了安慰，就和他朋友亚杜兰人希拉上亭拿去，到他剪羊毛的人那里。
{Gen 38:13} And when Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,"
{Gen 38:13} 有人告诉他玛说：“你的公公上亭拿剪羊毛去了。”
{Gen 38:14} she took off her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage.
{Gen 38:14} 他玛见示拉已经长大，还没有娶他为妻，就脱了他作寡妇的衣裳，用帕子蒙着脸，又遮住身体，坐在亭拿路上的伊拿印城门口。
{Gen 38:15} When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
{Gen 38:15} 犹大看见他，以为是妓女，因为他蒙着脸。
{Gen 38:16} He turned to her at the roadside and said, "Come, let me come in to you," for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"
{Gen 38:16} 犹大就转到他那里去，说：“来吧！让我与你同寝。”他原不知道是他的儿妇。他玛说：“你要与我同寝，把什么给我呢？”
{Gen 38:17} He answered, "I will send you a young goat from the flock." And she said, "If you give me a pledge, until you send it--"
{Gen 38:17} 犹大说：“我从羊群里取一只山羊羔，打发人送来给你。”他玛说：“在未送以先，你愿意给我一个当头吗？”
{Gen 38:18} He said, "What pledge shall I give you?" She replied, "Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
{Gen 38:18} 他说：“我给你什么当头呢？”他玛说：“你的印、你的带子，和你手里的杖。”犹大就给了他，与他同寝，他就从犹大怀了孕。
{Gen 38:19} Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.
{Gen 38:19} 他玛起来走了，除去帕子，仍旧穿上作寡妇的衣裳。
{Gen 38:20} When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her.
{Gen 38:20} 犹大托他朋友亚杜兰人送一只山羊羔去，要从那女人手里取回当头来，却找不着他，
{Gen 38:21} And he asked the men of the place, "Where is the cult prostitute who was at Enaim at the roadside?" And they said, "No cult prostitute has been here."
{Gen 38:21} 就问那地方的人说：“伊拿印路旁的妓女在那里？”他们说：“这里并没有妓女。”
{Gen 38:22} So he returned to Judah and said, "I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said, 'No cult prostitute has been here.'"
{Gen 38:22} 他回去见犹大说：“我没有找着他，并且那地方的人说：‘这里没有妓女。’”
{Gen 38:23} And Judah replied, "Let her keep the things as her own, or we shall be laughed at. You see, I sent this young goat, and you did not find her."
{Gen 38:23} 犹大说：“我把这山羊羔送去了，你竟找不着他。任凭他拿去吧，免得我们被羞辱。”
{Gen 38:24} About three months later Judah was told, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has been immoral. Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality." And Judah said, "Bring her out, and let her be burned."
{Gen 38:24} 约过了三个月，有人告诉犹大说：“你的儿妇他玛作了妓女，且因行淫有了身孕。”犹大说：“拉出他来，把他烧了！”
{Gen 38:25} As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, "By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant." And she said, "Please identify whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff."
{Gen 38:25} 他玛被拉出来的时候便打发人去见他公公，对他说：“这些东西是谁的，我就是从谁怀的孕。请你认一认，这印和带子并杖都是谁的？”
{Gen 38:26} Then Judah identified them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not know her again.
{Gen 38:26} 犹大承认说：“他比我更有义，因为我没有将他给我的儿子示拉。”从此犹大不再与他同寝了。
{Gen 38:27} When the time of her labor came, there were twins in her womb.
{Gen 38:27} 他玛将要生产，不料他腹里是一对双生。
{Gen 38:28} And when she was in labor, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, "This one came out first."
{Gen 38:28} 到生产的时候，一个孩子伸出一只手来；收生婆拿红线拴在他手上，说：“这是头生的。”
{Gen 38:29} But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out. And she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" Therefore his name was called Perez.
{Gen 38:29} 随后这孩子把手收回去，他哥哥生出来了；收生婆说：“你为什么抢着来呢？”因此给他起名叫法勒斯。
{Gen 38:30} Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.
{Gen 38:30} 后来，他兄弟那手上有红线的也生出来，就给他起名叫谢拉。
{Gen 39:1}  Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, had bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.
{Gen 39:1}  约瑟被带下埃及去。有一个埃及人，是法老的内臣护卫长波提乏，从那些带下他来的以实玛利人手下买了他去。
{Gen 39:2}  The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.
{Gen 39:2}  约瑟住在他主人埃及人的家中，耶和华与他同在，他就百事顺利。
{Gen 39:3}  His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.
{Gen 39:3}  他主人见耶和华与他同在，又见耶和华使他手里所办的尽都顺利，
{Gen 39:4}  So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had.
{Gen 39:4}  约瑟就在主人眼前蒙恩，伺候他主人，并且主人派他管理家务，把一切所有的都交在他手里。
{Gen 39:5}  From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had, in house and field.
{Gen 39:5}  自从主人派约瑟管理家务和他一切所有的，耶和华就因约瑟的缘故赐福与那埃及人的家；凡家里和田间一切所有的都蒙耶和华赐福。
{Gen 39:6}  So he left all that he had in Joseph's charge, and because of him he had no concern about anything but the food he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
{Gen 39:6}  波提乏将一切所有的都交在约瑟的手中，除了自己所吃的饭，别的事一概不知。约瑟原来秀雅俊美。
{Gen 39:7}  And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, "Lie with me."
{Gen 39:7}  这事以后，约瑟主人的妻以目送情给约瑟，说：“你与我同寝吧！”
{Gen 39:8}  But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Behold, because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my charge.
{Gen 39:8}  约瑟不从，对他主人的妻说：“看哪，一切家务，我主人都不知道；他把所有的都交在我手里。
{Gen 39:9}  He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"
{Gen 39:9}  在这家里没有比我大的；并且他没有留下一样不交给我，只留下了你，因为你是他的妻子。我怎能作这大恶，得罪神呢？”
{Gen 39:10} And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.
{Gen 39:10} 后来他天天和约瑟说，约瑟却不听从他，不与他同寝，也不和他在一处。
{Gen 39:11} But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house,
{Gen 39:11} 有一天，约瑟进屋里去办事，家中人没有一个在那屋里，
{Gen 39:12} she caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me." But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house.
{Gen 39:12} 妇人就拉住他的衣裳，说：“你与我同寝吧！”约瑟把衣裳丢在妇人手里，跑到外边去了。
{Gen 39:13} And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house,
{Gen 39:13} 妇人看见约瑟把衣裳丢在他手里跑出去了，
{Gen 39:14} she called to the men of her household and said to them, "See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.
{Gen 39:14} 就叫了家里的人来，对他们说：“你们看！他带了一个希伯来人进入我们家里，要戏弄我们。他到我这里来，要与我同寝，我就大声喊叫。
{Gen 39:15} And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house."
{Gen 39:15} 他听见我放声喊起来，就把衣裳丢在我这里，跑到外边去了。”
{Gen 39:16} Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home,
{Gen 39:16} 妇人把约瑟的衣裳放在自己那里，等着他主人回家，
{Gen 39:17} and she told him the same story, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me.
{Gen 39:17} 就对他如此如此说：“你所带到我们这里的那希伯来仆人进来要戏弄我，
{Gen 39:18} But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house."
{Gen 39:18} 我放声喊起来，他就把衣裳丢在我这里，跑出去了。”
{Gen 39:19} As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, "This is the way your servant treated me," his anger was kindled.
{Gen 39:19} 约瑟的主人听见他妻子对他所说的话，说：“你的仆人如此如此待我”，他就生气，
{Gen 39:20} And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.
{Gen 39:20} 把约瑟下在监里，就是王的囚犯被囚的地方。于是约瑟在那里坐监。
{Gen 39:21} But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
{Gen 39:21} 但耶和华与约瑟同在，向他施恩，使他在司狱的眼前蒙恩。
{Gen 39:22} And the keeper of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever was done there, he was the one who did it.
{Gen 39:22} 司狱就把监里所有的囚犯都交在约瑟手下；他们在那里所办的事都是经他的手。
{Gen 39:23} The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph's charge, because the LORD was with him. And whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.
{Gen 39:23} 凡在约瑟手下的事，司狱一概不察，因为耶和华与约瑟同在；耶和华使他所做的尽都顺利。
{Gen 40:1}  Some time after this, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt.
{Gen 40:1}  这事以后，埃及王的酒政和膳长得罪了他们的主埃及王，
{Gen 40:2}  And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
{Gen 40:2}  法老就恼怒酒政和膳长这二臣，
{Gen 40:3}  and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.
{Gen 40:3}  把他们下在护卫长府内的监里，就是约瑟被囚的地方。
{Gen 40:4}  The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. They continued for some time in custody.
{Gen 40:4}  护卫长把他们交给约瑟，约瑟便伺候他们；他们有些日子在监里。
{Gen 40:5}  And one night they both dreamed--the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison--each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation.
{Gen 40:5}  被囚在监之埃及王的酒政和膳长二人同夜各做一梦，各梦都有讲解。
{Gen 40:6}  When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.
{Gen 40:6}  到了早晨，约瑟进到他们那里，见他们有愁闷的样子。
{Gen 40:7}  So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, "Why are your faces downcast today?"
{Gen 40:7}  他便问法老的二臣，就是与他同囚在他主人府里的，说：“他们今日为什么面带愁容呢？”
{Gen 40:8}  They said to him, "We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them." And Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me."
{Gen 40:8}  他们对他说：“我们各人做了一梦，没有人能解。”约瑟说：“解梦不是出于神吗？请你们将梦告诉我。”
{Gen 40:9}  So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, "In my dream there was a vine before me,
{Gen 40:9}  酒政便将他的梦告诉约瑟说：“我梦见在我面前有一棵葡萄树，
{Gen 40:10} and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.
{Gen 40:10} 树上有三根枝子，好像发了芽，开了花，上头的葡萄都成熟了。
{Gen 40:11} Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."
{Gen 40:11} 法老的杯在我手中，我就拿葡萄挤在法老的杯里，将杯递在他手中。”
{Gen 40:12} Then Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.
{Gen 40:12} 约瑟对他说：“他所做的梦是这样解：三根枝子就是三天；
{Gen 40:13} In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer.
{Gen 40:13} 三天之内，法老必提你出监，叫你官复原职，你仍要递杯在法老的手中，和先前作他的酒政一样。
{Gen 40:14} Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.
{Gen 40:14} 但你得好处的时候，求你记念我，施恩与我，在法老面前提说我，救我出这监牢。
{Gen 40:15} For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit."
{Gen 40:15} 我实在是从希伯来人之地被拐来的；我在这里也没有做过什么，叫他们把我下在监里。”
{Gen 40:16} When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,
{Gen 40:16} 膳长见梦解得好，就对约瑟说：“我在梦中见我头上顶着三筐白饼；
{Gen 40:17} and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head."
{Gen 40:17} 极上的筐子里有为法老烤的各样食物，有飞鸟来吃我头上筐子里的食物。”
{Gen 40:18} And Joseph answered and said, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.
{Gen 40:18} 约瑟说：“你的梦是这样解：三个筐子就是三天；
{Gen 40:19} In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head--from you!--and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat the flesh from you."
{Gen 40:19} 三天之内，法老必斩断你的头，把你挂在木头上，必有飞鸟来吃你身上的肉。”
{Gen 40:20} On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
{Gen 40:20} 到了第三天，是法老的生日，他为众臣仆设摆筵席，把酒政和膳长提出监来，
{Gen 40:21} He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.
{Gen 40:21} 使酒政官复原职，他仍旧递杯在法老手中；
{Gen 40:22} But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
{Gen 40:22} 但把膳长挂起来，正如约瑟向他们所解的话。
{Gen 40:23} Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
{Gen 40:23} 酒政却不记念约瑟，竟忘了他。
{Gen 41:1}  After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,
{Gen 41:1}  过了两年，法老做梦，梦见自己站在河边，
{Gen 41:2}  and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows attractive and plump, and they fed in the reed grass.
{Gen 41:2}  有七只母牛从河里上来，又美好又肥壮，在芦荻中吃草。
{Gen 41:3}  And behold, seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
{Gen 41:3}  随后又有七只母牛从河里上来，又丑陋又干瘦，与那七只母牛一同站在河边。
{Gen 41:4}  And the ugly, thin cows ate up the seven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke.
{Gen 41:4}  这又丑陋又干瘦的七只母牛吃尽了那又美好又肥壮的七只母牛。法老就醒了。
{Gen 41:5}  And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.
{Gen 41:5}  他又睡着，第二回做梦，梦见一棵麦子长了七个穗子，又肥大又佳美，
{Gen 41:6}  And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind.
{Gen 41:6}  随后又长了七个穗子，又细弱又被东风吹焦了。
{Gen 41:7}  And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
{Gen 41:7}  这细弱的穗子吞了那七个又肥大又饱满的穗子。法老醒了，不料是个梦。
{Gen 41:8}  So in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
{Gen 41:8}  到了早晨，法老心里不安，就差人召了埃及所有的术士和博士来；法老就把所做的梦告诉他们，却没有人能给法老圆解。
{Gen 41:9}  Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "I remember my offenses today.
{Gen 41:9}  那时酒政对法老说：“我今日想起我的罪来。
{Gen 41:10} When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,
{Gen 41:10} 从前法老恼怒臣仆，把我和膳长下在护卫长府布的监里。
{Gen 41:11} we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation.
{Gen 41:11} 我们二人同夜各做一梦，各梦都有讲解。
{Gen 41:12} A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream.
{Gen 41:12} 在那里同着我们有一个希伯来的少年人，是护卫长的仆人，我们告诉他，他就把我们的梦圆解，是按着各人的梦圆解的。
{Gen 41:13} And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged."
{Gen 41:13} 后来正如他给我们圆解的成就了；我官复原职，膳长被挂起来了。”
{Gen 41:14} Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh.
{Gen 41:14} 法老遂即差人去召约瑟，他们便急忙带他出监，他就剃头，刮脸，换衣裳，进到法老面前。
{Gen 41:15} And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
{Gen 41:15} 法老对约瑟说：“我做了一梦，没有人能解；我听见人说，你听了梦就能解。”
{Gen 41:16} Joseph answered Pharaoh, "It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."
{Gen 41:16} 约瑟回答法老说：“这不在乎我，神必将平安的话回答法老。”
{Gen 41:17} Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile.
{Gen 41:17} 法老对约瑟说：“我梦见我站在河边，
{Gen 41:18} Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass.
{Gen 41:18} 有七只母牛从河里上来，又肥壮又美好，在芦荻中吃草。
{Gen 41:19} Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.
{Gen 41:19} 随后又有七只母牛上来，又软弱又丑陋又干瘦，在埃及遍地，我没有见过这样不好的。
{Gen 41:20} And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows,
{Gen 41:20} 这又干瘦又丑陋的母牛吃尽了那以先的七只肥母牛，
{Gen 41:21} but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke.
{Gen 41:21} 吃了以后却看不出是吃了，那丑陋的样子仍旧和先前一样。我就醒了。
{Gen 41:22} I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good.
{Gen 41:22} 我又梦见一棵麦子，长了七个穗子，又饱满又佳美，
{Gen 41:23} Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them,
{Gen 41:23} 随后又长了七个穗子，枯槁细弱，被东风吹焦了。
{Gen 41:24} and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."
{Gen 41:24} 这些细弱的穗子吞了那七个佳美的穗子。我将这梦告诉了术士，却没有人能给我解说。”
{Gen 41:25} Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
{Gen 41:25} 约瑟对法老说：“法老的梦乃是一个。神已将所要做的事指示法老了。
{Gen 41:26} The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one.
{Gen 41:26} 七只好母牛是七年，七个好穗子也是七年；这梦乃是一个。
{Gen 41:27} The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine.
{Gen 41:27} 那随后上来的七只又干瘦又丑陋的母牛是七年，那七个虚空、被东风吹焦的穗子也是七年，都是七个荒年。
{Gen 41:28} It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
{Gen 41:28} 这就是我对法老所说，神已将所要做的事显明给法老了。
{Gen 41:29} There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,
{Gen 41:29} 埃及遍地必来七个大丰年，
{Gen 41:30} but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,
{Gen 41:30} 随后又要来七个荒年，甚至埃及地都忘了先前的丰收，全地必被饥荒所灭。
{Gen 41:31} and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe.
{Gen 41:31} 因那以后的饥荒甚大，便不觉得先前的丰收了。
{Gen 41:32} And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about.
{Gen 41:32} 至于法老两回做梦，是因神命定这事，而且必速速成就。
{Gen 41:33} Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
{Gen 41:33} 所以，法老当拣选一个有聪明有智慧的人，派他治理埃及地。
{Gen 41:34} Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plentiful years.
{Gen 41:34} 法老当这样行，又派官员管理这地。当七个丰年的时候，征收埃及地的五分之一，
{Gen 41:35} And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
{Gen 41:35} 叫他们把将来丰年一切的粮食聚敛起来，积蓄五谷，收存在各城里做食物，归于法老的手下。
{Gen 41:36} That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."
{Gen 41:36} 所积蓄的粮食可以防备埃及地将来的七个荒年，免得这地被饥荒所灭。”
{Gen 41:37} This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.
{Gen 41:37} 法老和他一切臣仆都以这事为妙。
{Gen 41:38} And Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?"
{Gen 41:38} 法老对臣仆说：“像这样的人，有神的灵在他里头，我们岂能找得着呢？”
{Gen 41:39} Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are.
{Gen 41:39} 法老对约瑟说：“神既将这事都指示你，可见没有人像你这样有聪明有智慧。
{Gen 41:40} You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you."
{Gen 41:40} 你可以掌管我的家；我的民都必听从你的话。惟独在宝座上我比你大。”
{Gen 41:41} And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."
{Gen 41:41} 法老又对约瑟说：“我派你治理埃及全地。”
{Gen 41:42} Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck.
{Gen 41:42} 法老就摘下手上打印的戒指，戴在约瑟的手上，给他穿上细麻衣，把金链戴在他的颈项上，
{Gen 41:43} And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, "Bow the knee!" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.
{Gen 41:43} 又叫约瑟坐他的副车，喝道的在前呼叫说：“跪下。”这样、法老派他治理埃及全地。
{Gen 41:44} Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
{Gen 41:44} 法老对约瑟说：“我是法老，在埃及全地，若没有你的命令，不许人擅自办事（原文作动手动脚）。”
{Gen 41:45} And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
{Gen 41:45} 法老赐名给约瑟，叫撒发那忒巴内亚，又将安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳给他为妻。约瑟就出去巡行埃及地。
{Gen 41:46} Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.
{Gen 41:46} 约瑟见埃及王法老的时候年三十岁。他从法老面前出去，遍行埃及全地。
{Gen 41:47} During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly,
{Gen 41:47} 七个丰年之内，地的出产极丰极盛（原文作一把一把的），
{Gen 41:48} and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it.
{Gen 41:48} 约瑟聚敛埃及地七个丰年一切的粮食，把粮食积存在各城里；各城周围田地的粮食都积存在本城里。
{Gen 41:49} And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.
{Gen 41:49} 约瑟积蓄五谷甚多，如同海边的沙，无法计算，因为谷不可胜数。
{Gen 41:50} Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him.
{Gen 41:50} 荒年未到以前，安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳给约瑟生了两个儿子。
{Gen 41:51} Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house."
{Gen 41:51} 约瑟给长子起名叫玛拿西（就是使之忘了的意思），因为他说：“神使我忘了一切的困苦和我父的全家。”
{Gen 41:52} The name of the second he called Ephraim, "For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
{Gen 41:52} 他给次子起名叫以法莲（就是使之昌盛的意思），因为他说：“神使我在受苦的地方昌盛。”
{Gen 41:53} The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end,
{Gen 41:53} 埃及地的七个丰年一完，
{Gen 41:54} and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
{Gen 41:54} 七个荒年就来了。正如约瑟所说的，各地都有饥荒；惟独埃及全地有粮食。
{Gen 41:55} When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do."
{Gen 41:55} 及至埃及全地有了饥荒，众民向法老哀求粮食，法老对他们说：“你们往约瑟那里去，凡他所说的，你们都要做。”
{Gen 41:56} So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
{Gen 41:56} 当时饥荒遍满天下，约瑟开了各处的仓，粜粮给埃及人；在埃及地饥荒甚大。
{Gen 41:57} Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.
{Gen 41:57} 各地的人都往埃及去，到约瑟那里籴粮，因为天下的饥荒甚大。
{Gen 42:1}  When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?"
{Gen 42:1}  雅各见埃及有粮，就对儿子们说：“你们为什么彼此观望呢？
{Gen 42:2}  And he said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die."
{Gen 42:2}  我听见埃及有粮，你们可以下去，从那里为我们籴些来，使我们可以存活，不至于死。”
{Gen 42:3}  So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.
{Gen 42:3}  于是，约瑟的十个哥哥都下埃及籴粮去了。
{Gen 42:4}  But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him.
{Gen 42:4}  但约瑟的兄弟便雅悯，雅各没有打发他和哥哥们同去，因为雅各说：“恐怕他遭害。”
{Gen 42:5}  Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
{Gen 42:5}  来籴粮的人中有以色列的儿子们，因为迦南地也有饥荒。
{Gen 42:6}  Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.
{Gen 42:6}  当时治理埃及地的是约瑟；粜粮给那地众民的就是他。约瑟的哥哥们来了，脸伏于地，向他下拜。
{Gen 42:7}  Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. "Where do you come from?" he said. They said, "From the land of Canaan, to buy food."
{Gen 42:7}  约瑟看见他哥哥们，就认得他们，却装作生人，向他们说些严厉话，问他们说：“你们从那里来？”他们说：“我们从迦南地来籴粮。”
{Gen 42:8}  And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
{Gen 42:8}  约瑟认得他哥哥们，他们却不认得他。
{Gen 42:9}  And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, "You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land."
{Gen 42:9}  约瑟想起从前所做的那两个梦，就对他们说：“你们是奸细，来窥探这地的虚实。”
{Gen 42:10} They said to him, "No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food.
{Gen 42:10} 他们对他说：“我主啊，不是的。仆人们是籴粮来的。
{Gen 42:11} We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies."
{Gen 42:11} 我们都是一个人的儿子，是诚实人；仆人们并不是奸细。”
{Gen 42:12} He said to them, "No, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see."
{Gen 42:12} 约瑟说：“不然，你们必是窥探这地的虚实来的。”
{Gen 42:13} And they said, "We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more."
{Gen 42:13} 他们说：“仆人们本是弟兄十二人，是迦南地一个人的儿子，顶小的现今在我们的父亲那里，有一个没有了。”
{Gen 42:14} But Joseph said to them, "It is as I said to you. You are spies.
{Gen 42:14} 约瑟说：“我才说你们是奸细，这话实在不错。
{Gen 42:15} By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
{Gen 42:15} 我指着法老的性命起誓，若是你们的小兄弟不到这里来，你们就不得出这地方，从此就可以把你们证验出来了。
{Gen 42:16} Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies."
{Gen 42:16} 须要打发你们中间一个人去，把你们的兄弟带来。至于你们，都要囚在这里，好证验你们的话真不真，若不真，我指着法老的性命起誓，你们一定是奸细。”
{Gen 42:17} And he put them all together in custody for three days.
{Gen 42:17} 于是约瑟把他们都下在监里三天。
{Gen 42:18} On the third day Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God:
{Gen 42:18} 到了第三天，约瑟对他们说：“我是敬畏神的；你们照我的话行就可以存活。
{Gen 42:19} if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households,
{Gen 42:19} 你们如果是诚实人，可以留你们中间的一个人囚在监里，但你们可以带着粮食回去，救你们家里的饥荒。
{Gen 42:20} and bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die." And they did so.
{Gen 42:20} 把你们的小兄弟带到我这里来，如此，你们的话便有证据，你们也不至于死。”他们就照样而行。
{Gen 42:21} Then they said to one another, "In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us."
{Gen 42:21} 他们彼此说：“我们在兄弟身上实在有罪。他哀求我们的时候，我们见他心里的愁苦，却不肯听，所以这场苦难临到我们身上。”
{Gen 42:22} And Reuben answered them, "Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood."
{Gen 42:22} 流便说：“我岂不是对你们说过，不可伤害那孩子吗？只是你们不肯听，所以流他血的罪向我们追讨。”
{Gen 42:23} They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them.
{Gen 42:23} 他们不知道约瑟听得出来，因为在他们中间用通事传话。
{Gen 42:24} Then he turned away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
{Gen 42:24} 约瑟转身退去，哭了一场，又回来对他们说话，就从他们中间挑出西缅来，在他们眼前把他捆绑。
{Gen 42:25} And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.
{Gen 42:25} 约瑟吩咐人把粮食装满他们的器具，把各人的银子归还在各人的口袋里，又给他们路上用的食物，人就照他的话办了。
{Gen 42:26} Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed.
{Gen 42:26} 他们就把粮食驮在驴上，离开那里去了。
{Gen 42:27} And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack.
{Gen 42:27} 到了住宿的地方，他们中间有一个人打开口袋，要拿料喂驴，才看见自己的银子仍在口袋里，
{Gen 42:28} He said to his brothers, "My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!" At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?"
{Gen 42:28} 就对弟兄们说：“我的银子归还了，看啊，仍在我口袋里！”他们就提心吊胆，战战兢兢地彼此说：“这是神向我们做什么呢？”
{Gen 42:29} When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,
{Gen 42:29} 他们来到迦南地、他们的父亲雅各那里，将所遭遇的事都告诉他，说：
{Gen 42:30} "The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land.
{Gen 42:30} “那地的主对我们说严厉的话，把我们当作窥探那地的奸细。
{Gen 42:31} But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we have never been spies.
{Gen 42:31} 我们对他说：‘我们是诚实人，并不是奸细。
{Gen 42:32} We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.'
{Gen 42:32} 我们本是弟兄十二人，都是一个父亲的儿子，有一个没有了，顶小的如今同我们的父亲在迦南地。’
{Gen 42:33} Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way.
{Gen 42:33} 那地的主对我们说：‘若要我知道你们是诚实人，可以留下你们中间的一个人在我这里，你们可以带着粮食回去，救你们家里的饥荒。
{Gen 42:34} Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.'"
{Gen 42:34} 把你们的小兄弟带到我这里来，我便知道你们不是奸细，乃是诚实人。这样，我就把你们的弟兄交给你们，你们也可以在这地做买卖。’”
{Gen 42:35} As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
{Gen 42:35} 后来他们倒口袋，不料，各人的银包都在口袋里；他们和父亲看见银包就都害怕。
{Gen 42:36} And Jacob their father said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me."
{Gen 42:36} 他们的父亲雅各对他们说：“你们使我丧失我的儿子：约瑟没有了，西缅也没有了，你们又要将便雅悯带去；这些事都归到我身上了。”
{Gen 42:37} Then Reuben said to his father, "Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you."
{Gen 42:37} 流便对他父亲说：“我若不带他回来交给你，你可以杀我的两个儿子。只管把他交在我手里，我必带他回来交给你。”
{Gen 42:38} But he said, "My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
{Gen 42:38} 雅各说：“我的儿子不可与你们一同下去；他哥哥死了，只剩下他，他若在你们所行的路上遭害，那便是你们使我白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨地下阴间去了。”
{Gen 43:1}  Now the famine was severe in the land.
{Gen 43:1}  那地的饥荒甚大。
{Gen 43:2}  And when they had eaten the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go again, buy us a little food."
{Gen 43:2}  他们从埃及带来的粮食吃尽了，他们的父亲就对他们说：“你们再去给我籴些粮来。”
{Gen 43:3}  But Judah said to him, "The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'
{Gen 43:3}  犹大对他说：“那人谆谆地告诫我们说：‘你们的兄弟若不与你们同来，你们就不得见我的面。’
{Gen 43:4}  If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.
{Gen 43:4}  你若打发我们的兄弟与我们同去，我们就下去给你籴粮；
{Gen 43:5}  But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'"
{Gen 43:5}  你若不打发他去，我们就不下去，因为那人对我们说：‘你们的兄弟若不与你们同来，你们就不得见我的面。’”
{Gen 43:6}  Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?"
{Gen 43:6}  以色列说：“你们为什么这样害我，告诉那人你们还有兄弟呢？”
{Gen 43:7}  They replied, "The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?"
{Gen 43:7}  他们回答说：“那人详细问到我们和我们的亲属，说：‘你们的父亲还在吗？你们还有兄弟吗？’我们就按着他所问的告诉他，焉能知道他要说‘必须把你们的兄弟带下来’呢？”
{Gen 43:8}  And Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.
{Gen 43:8}  犹大又对他父亲以色列说：“你打发童子与我同去，我们就起身下去，好叫我们和你，并我们的妇人孩子，都得存活，不至于死。
{Gen 43:9}  I will be a pledge of his safety. From my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever.
{Gen 43:9}  我为他作保；你可以从我手中追讨，我若不带他回来交在你面前，我情愿永远担罪。
{Gen 43:10} If we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice."
{Gen 43:10} 我们若没有耽搁，如今第二次都回来了。”
{Gen 43:11} Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the man, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
{Gen 43:11} 他们的父亲以色列说：“若必须如此，你们就当这样行：可以将这地土产中最好的乳香、蜂蜜、香料、没药、榧子、杏仁都取一点，收在器具里，带下去送给那人作礼物，
{Gen 43:12} Take double the money with you. Carry back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.
{Gen 43:12} 又要手里加倍地带银子，并将归还在你们口袋内的银子仍带在手里；那或者是错了。
{Gen 43:13} Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man.
{Gen 43:13} 也带着你们的兄弟，起身去见那人。
{Gen 43:14} May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
{Gen 43:14} 但愿全能的神使你们在那人面前蒙怜悯，释放你们的那弟兄和便雅悯回来。我若丧了儿子，就丧了吧！”
{Gen 43:15} So the men took this present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin. They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
{Gen 43:15} 于是，他们拿着那礼物，又手里加倍地带银子，并且带着便雅悯，起身下到埃及，站在约瑟面前。
{Gen 43:16} When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon."
{Gen 43:16} 约瑟见便雅悯和他们同来，就对家宰说：“将这些人领到屋里。要宰杀牲畜，预备筵席，因为晌午这些人同我吃饭。”
{Gen 43:17} The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph's house.
{Gen 43:17} 家宰就遵着约瑟的命去行，领他们进约瑟的屋里。
{Gen 43:18} And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, "It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us to make us servants and seize our donkeys."
{Gen 43:18} 他们因为被领到约瑟的屋里，就害怕，说：“领我们到这里来，必是因为头次归还在我们口袋里的银子，找我们的错缝，下手害我们，强取我们为奴仆，抢夺我们的驴。”
{Gen 43:19} So they went up to the steward of Joseph's house and spoke with him at the door of the house,
{Gen 43:19} 他们就挨进约瑟的家宰，在屋门口和他说话，
{Gen 43:20} and said, "Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food.
{Gen 43:20} 说：“我主啊，我们头次下来实在是要籴粮。
{Gen 43:21} And when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was each man's money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it again with us,
{Gen 43:21} 后来到了住宿的地方，我们打开口袋，不料，各人的银子，分量足数，仍在各人的口袋内，现在我们手里又带回来了。
{Gen 43:22} and we have brought other money down with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks."
{Gen 43:22} 另外又带下银子来籴粮。不知道先前谁把银子放在我们的口袋里。”
{Gen 43:23} He replied, "Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you. I received your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
{Gen 43:23} 家宰说：“你们可以放心，不要害怕，是你们的神和你们父亲的神赐给你们财宝在你们的口袋里；你们的银子，我早已收了。”他就把西缅带出来，交给他们。
{Gen 43:24} And when the man had brought the men into Joseph's house and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their donkeys fodder,
{Gen 43:24} 家宰就领他们进约瑟的屋里，给他们水洗脚，又给他们草料喂驴。
{Gen 43:25} they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
{Gen 43:25} 他们就预备那礼物，等候约瑟晌午来，因为他们听见要在那里吃饭。
{Gen 43:26} When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present that they had with them and bowed down to him to the ground.
{Gen 43:26} 约瑟来到家里，他们就把手中的礼物拿进屋去给他，又俯伏在地，向他下拜。
{Gen 43:27} And he inquired about their welfare and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"
{Gen 43:27} 约瑟问他们好，又问：“你们的父亲，就是你们所说的那老人家平安吗？他还在吗？”
{Gen 43:28} They said, "Your servant our father is well; he is still alive." And they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.
{Gen 43:28} 他们回答说：“你仆人我们的父亲平安；他还在。”于是他们低头下拜。
{Gen 43:29} And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!"
{Gen 43:29} 约瑟举目看见他同母的兄弟便雅悯，就说：“你们向我所说那顶小的兄弟就是这位吗？”又说：“小儿啊，愿神赐恩给你！”
{Gen 43:30} Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there.
{Gen 43:30} 约瑟爱弟之情发动，就急忙寻找可哭之地，进入自己的屋里，哭了一场。
{Gen 43:31} Then he washed his face and came out. And controlling himself he said, "Serve the food."
{Gen 43:31} 他洗了脸出来，勉强隐忍，吩咐人摆饭。
{Gen 43:32} They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
{Gen 43:32} 他们就为约瑟单摆了一席，为那些人又摆了一席，也为和约瑟同吃饭的埃及人另摆了一席，因为埃及人不可和希伯来人一同吃饭；那原是埃及人所厌恶的。
{Gen 43:33} And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another in amazement.
{Gen 43:33} 约瑟使众弟兄在他面前排列坐席，都按着长幼的次序，众弟兄就彼此诧异。
{Gen 43:34} Portions were taken to them from Joseph's table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.
{Gen 43:34} 约瑟把他面前的食物分出来，送给他们；但便雅悯所得的比别人多五倍。他们就饮酒，和约瑟一同宴乐。
{Gen 44:1}  Then he commanded the steward of his house, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack,
{Gen 44:1}  约瑟吩咐家宰说：“把粮食装满这些人的口袋，尽着他们的驴所能驮的，又把各人的银子放在各人的口袋里，
{Gen 44:2}  and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain." And he did as Joseph told him.
{Gen 44:2}  并将我的银杯和那少年人籴粮的银子一同装在他的口袋里。”家宰就照约瑟所说的话行了；
{Gen 44:3}  As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys.
{Gen 44:3}  天一亮就打发那些人带着驴走了。
{Gen 44:4}  They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his steward, "Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?
{Gen 44:4}  他们出城走了不远，约瑟对家宰说：“起来，追那些人去，追上了就对他们说：‘你们为什么以恶报善呢？
{Gen 44:5}  Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.'"
{Gen 44:5}  这不是我主人饮酒的杯吗？岂不是他占卜用的吗？你们这样行是作恶了。’”
{Gen 44:6}  When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words.
{Gen 44:6}  家宰追上他们，将这些话对他们说了。
{Gen 44:7}  They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!
{Gen 44:7}  他们回答说：“我主为什么说这样的话呢？你仆人断不能做这样的事。
{Gen 44:8}  Behold, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?
{Gen 44:8}  你看，我们从前在口袋里所见的银子，尚且从迦南地带来还你，我们怎能从你主人家里偷窃金银呢？
{Gen 44:9}  Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be my lord's servants."
{Gen 44:9}  你仆人中无论在谁那里搜出来，就叫他死，我们也作我主的奴仆。”
{Gen 44:10} He said, "Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent."
{Gen 44:10} 家宰说：“现在就照你们的话行吧！在谁那里搜出来，谁就作我的奴仆；其余的都没有罪。”
{Gen 44:11} Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
{Gen 44:11} 于是他们各人急忙把口袋卸在地下，各人打开口袋。
{Gen 44:12} And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
{Gen 44:12} 家宰就搜查，从年长的起到年幼的为止，那杯竟在便雅悯的口袋里搜出来。
{Gen 44:13} Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.
{Gen 44:13} 他们就撕裂衣服，各人把驮子抬在驴上，回城去了。
{Gen 44:14} When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there. They fell before him to the ground.
{Gen 44:14} 犹大和他弟兄们来到约瑟的屋中，约瑟还在那里，他们就在他面前俯伏于地。
{Gen 44:15} Joseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?"
{Gen 44:15} 约瑟对他们说：“你们做的是什么事呢？你们岂不知像我这样的人必能占卜吗？”
{Gen 44:16} And Judah said, "What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord's servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found."
{Gen 44:16} 犹大说：“我们对我主说什么呢？还有什么话可说呢？我们怎能自己表白出来呢？神已经查出仆人的罪孽了。我们与那在他手中搜出杯来的都是我主的奴仆。”
{Gen 44:17} But he said, "Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father."
{Gen 44:17} 约瑟说：“我断不能这样行！在谁的手中搜出杯来，谁就作我的奴仆；至于你们，可以平平安安的上你们父亲那里去。”
{Gen 44:18} Then Judah went up to him and said, "Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself.
{Gen 44:18} 犹大挨近他，说：“我主啊，求你容仆人说一句话给我主听，不要向仆人发烈怒，因为你如同法老一样。
{Gen 44:19} My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?'
{Gen 44:19} 我主曾问仆人们说：‘你们有父亲有兄弟没有？’
{Gen 44:20} And we said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children, and his father loves him.'
{Gen 44:20} 我们对我主说：‘我们有父亲，已经年老，还有他老年所生的一个小孩子。他哥哥死了，他母亲只撇下他一人，他父亲疼爱他。’
{Gen 44:21} Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.'
{Gen 44:21} 你对仆人说：‘把他带到我这里来，叫我亲眼看看他。’
{Gen 44:22} We said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'
{Gen 44:22} 我们对我主说：‘童子不能离开他父亲，若是离开，他父亲必死。’
{Gen 44:23} Then you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.'
{Gen 44:23} 你对仆人说：‘你们的小兄弟若不与你们一同下来，你们就不得再见我的面。’
{Gen 44:24} "When we went back to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
{Gen 44:24} 我们上到你仆人我们父亲那里，就把我主的话告诉了他。
{Gen 44:25} And when our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food,'
{Gen 44:25} 我们的父亲说：‘你们再去给我籴些粮来。’
{Gen 44:26} we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
{Gen 44:26} 我们就说：‘我们不能下去。我们的小兄弟若和我们同往，我们就可以下去。因为，小兄弟若不与我们同往，我们必不得见那人的面。’
{Gen 44:27} Then your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.
{Gen 44:27} 你仆人我父亲对我们说：‘你们知道我的妻子给我生了两个儿子。
{Gen 44:28} One left me, and I said, "Surely he has been torn to pieces," and I have never seen him since.
{Gen 44:28} 一个离开我出去了；我说他必是被撕碎了，直到如今我也没有见他。
{Gen 44:29} If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.'
{Gen 44:29} 现在你们又要把这个带去离开我，倘若他遭害，那便是你们使我白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨地下阴间去了。’
{Gen 44:30} "Now therefore, as soon as I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy's life,
{Gen 44:30} 我父亲的命与这童子的命相连。如今我回到你仆人我父亲那里，若没有童子与我们同在，
{Gen 44:31} as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
{Gen 44:31} 我们的父亲见没有童子，他就必死。这便是我们使你仆人我们的父亲白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨地下阴间去了。
{Gen 44:32} For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.'
{Gen 44:32} 因为仆人曾向我父亲为这童子作保，说：‘我若不带他回来交给父亲，我便在父亲面前永远担罪。’
{Gen 44:33} Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers.
{Gen 44:33} 现在求你容仆人住下，替这童子作我主的奴仆，叫童子和他哥哥们一同上去。
{Gen 44:34} For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my father."
{Gen 44:34} 若童子不和我同去，我怎能上去见我父亲呢？恐怕我看见灾祸临到我父亲身上。”
{Gen 45:1}  Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him. He cried, "Make everyone go out from me." So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
{Gen 45:1}  约瑟在左右站着的人面前情不自禁，吩咐一声说：“人都要离开我出去！”约瑟和弟兄相认的时候并没有一人站在他面前。
{Gen 45:2}  And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.
{Gen 45:2}  他就放声大哭；埃及人和法老家中的人都听见了。
{Gen 45:3}  And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
{Gen 45:3}  约瑟对他弟兄们说：“我是约瑟。我的父亲还在吗？”他弟兄不能回答，因为在他面前都惊惶。
{Gen 45:4}  So Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, please." And they came near. And he said, "I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.
{Gen 45:4}  约瑟又对他弟兄们说：“请你们近前来。”他们就近前来。他说：“我是你们的兄弟约瑟，就是你们所卖到埃及的。
{Gen 45:5}  And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
{Gen 45:5}  现在，不要因为把我卖到这里自忧自恨。这是神差我在你们以先来，为要保全生命。
{Gen 45:6}  For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
{Gen 45:6}  现在这地的饥荒已经二年了，还在五年不能耕种，不能收成。
{Gen 45:7}  And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.
{Gen 45:7}  神差我在你们以先来，为要给你们存留余种在世上，又要大施拯救，保全你们的生命。
{Gen 45:8}  So it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
{Gen 45:8}  这样看来，差我到这里来的不是你们，乃是神。他又使我如法老的父，作他全家的主，并埃及全地的宰相。
{Gen 45:9}  Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not tarry.
{Gen 45:9}  你们要赶紧上到我父亲那里。对他说：‘你儿子约瑟这样说：神使我作全埃及的主，请你下到我这里来，不要耽延。
{Gen 45:10} You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.
{Gen 45:10} 你和你我儿子孙子，连牛群羊群，并一切所有的，都可以住在歌珊地，与我相近。
{Gen 45:11} There I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come, so that you and your household, and all that you have, do not come to poverty.'
{Gen 45:11} 我要在那里奉养你；因为还有五年的饥荒，免得你和你的眷属，并一切所有的，都败落了。’
{Gen 45:12} And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
{Gen 45:12} 况且你们的眼和我兄弟便雅悯的眼都看见是我亲口对你们说话。
{Gen 45:13} You must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here."
{Gen 45:13} 你们也要将我在埃及一切的荣耀和你们所看见的事都告诉我父亲，又要赶紧地将我父亲搬到我这里来。”
{Gen 45:14} Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
{Gen 45:14} 于是约瑟伏在他兄弟便雅悯的颈项上哭，便雅悯也在他的颈项上哭。
{Gen 45:15} And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. After that his brothers talked with him.
{Gen 45:15} 他又与众弟兄亲嘴，抱着他们哭，随后他弟兄就和他说话。
{Gen 45:16} When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, "Joseph's brothers have come," it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.
{Gen 45:16} 这风声传到法老的宫里，说：“约瑟的弟兄们来了。”法老和他的臣仆都很喜欢。
{Gen 45:17} And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan,
{Gen 45:17} 法老对约瑟说：“你吩咐你的弟兄们说：‘你们要这样行：把驮子抬在牲口上，起身往迦南地去。
{Gen 45:18} and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.'
{Gen 45:18} 将你们的父亲和你们的眷属都搬到我这里来，我要把埃及地的美物赐给你们，你们也要吃这地肥美的出产。
{Gen 45:19} And you, Joseph, are commanded to say, 'Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
{Gen 45:19} 现在我吩咐你们要这样行：从埃及地带着车辆去，把你们的孩子和妻子，并你们的父亲都搬来。
{Gen 45:20} Have no concern for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"
{Gen 45:20} 你们眼中不要爱惜你们的家具，因为埃及全地的美物都是你们的。’”
{Gen 45:21} The sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.
{Gen 45:21} 以色列的儿子们就如此行。约瑟照着法老的吩咐给他们车辆和路上用的食物，
{Gen 45:22} To each and all of them he gave a change of clothes, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five changes of clothes.
{Gen 45:22} 又给他们各人一套衣服，惟独给便雅悯三百银子，五套衣服；
{Gen 45:23} To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey.
{Gen 45:23} 送给他父亲公驴十匹，驮着埃及的美物，母驴十匹，驮着粮食与饼和菜，为他父亲路上用。
{Gen 45:24} Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, "Do not quarrel on the way."
{Gen 45:24} 于是约瑟打发他弟兄们回去，又对他们说：“你们不要在路上相争。”
{Gen 45:25} So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob.
{Gen 45:25} 他们从埃及上去，来到迦南地、他们的父亲雅各那里，
{Gen 45:26} And they told him, "Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt." And his heart became numb, for he did not believe them.
{Gen 45:26} 告诉他说：“约瑟还在，并且作埃及全地的宰相。”雅各心里冰凉，因为不信他们。
{Gen 45:27} But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
{Gen 45:27} 他们便将约瑟对他们说的一切话都告诉了他。他们父亲雅各又看见约瑟打发来接他的车辆，心就苏醒了。
{Gen 45:28} And Israel said, "It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
{Gen 45:28} 以色列说：“罢了！罢了！我的儿子约瑟还在，趁我未死以先，我要去见他一面。”
{Gen 46:1}  So Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
{Gen 46:1}  以色列带着一切所有的，起身来到别是巴，就献祭给他父亲以撒的神。
{Gen 46:2}  And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob." And he said, "Here I am."
{Gen 46:2}  夜间，神在异象中对以色列说：“雅各！雅各！”他说：“我在这里。”
{Gen 46:3}  Then he said, "I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.
{Gen 46:3}  神说：“我是神，就是你父亲的神。你下埃及去不要害怕，因为我必使你在那里成为大族。
{Gen 46:4}  I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again, and Joseph's hand shall close your eyes."
{Gen 46:4}  我要和你同下埃及去，也必定带你上来；约瑟必给你送终（原文作将手按在你的眼睛上）。”
{Gen 46:5}  Then Jacob set out from Beersheba. The sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
{Gen 46:5}  雅各就从别是巴起行。以色列的儿子们使他们的父亲雅各和他们的妻子、儿女都坐在法老为雅各送来的车上。
{Gen 46:6}  They also took their livestock and their goods, which they had gained in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him,
{Gen 46:6}  他们又带着迦南地所得的牲畜、货财来到埃及。雅各和他的一切子孙都一同来了。
{Gen 46:7}  his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters. All his offspring he brought with him into Egypt.
{Gen 46:7}  雅各把他的儿子、孙子、女儿、孙女，并他的子子孙孙，一同带到埃及。

{Gen 46:26} All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own descendants, not including Jacob's sons' wives, were sixty-six persons in all.
{Gen 46:26} 那与雅各同到埃及的，除了他儿妇之外，凡从他所生的，共有六十六人。
{Gen 46:27} And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two. All the persons of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were seventy.
{Gen 46:27} 还有约瑟在埃及所生的两个儿子。雅各家来到埃及的共有七十人。
{Gen 46:28} He had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to show the way before him in Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen.
{Gen 46:28} 雅各打发犹大先去见约瑟，请派人引路往歌珊去；于是他们来到歌珊地。
{Gen 46:29} Then Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen. He presented himself to him and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while.
{Gen 46:29} 约瑟套车往歌珊去，迎接他父亲以色列，及至见了面，就伏在父亲的颈项，哭了许久。
{Gen 46:30} Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive."
{Gen 46:30} 以色列对约瑟说：“我既得见你的面，知道你还在，就是死我也甘心。”
{Gen 46:31} Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and tell Pharaoh and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
{Gen 46:31} 约瑟对他的弟兄和他父的全家说：“我要上去告诉法老，对他说：‘我的弟兄和我父的全家从前在迦南地，现今都到我这里来了。
{Gen 46:32} And the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.'
{Gen 46:32} 他们本是牧羊的人，以养牲畜为业；他们把羊群牛群和一切所有的都带来了。’
{Gen 46:33} When Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?'
{Gen 46:33} 等法老召你们的时候，问你们说：‘你们以何事为业？’
{Gen 46:34} you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,' in order that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."
{Gen 46:34} 你们要说：‘你的仆人，从幼年直到如今，都以养牲畜为业，连我们的祖宗也都以此为业。’这样，你们可以住在歌珊地，因为凡牧羊的都被埃及人所厌恶。”
{Gen 47:1}  So Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, "My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan. They are now in the land of Goshen."
{Gen 47:1}  约瑟进去告诉法老说：“我的父亲和我的弟兄带着羊群牛群，并一切所有的，从迦南地来了，如今在歌珊地。”
{Gen 47:2}  And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh.
{Gen 47:2}  约瑟从他弟兄中挑出五个人来，引他们去见法老。
{Gen 47:3}  Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?" And they said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were."
{Gen 47:3}  法老问约瑟的弟兄说：“你们以可事为业？”他们对法老说：“你仆人是牧羊的，连我们的祖宗也是牧羊的。”
{Gen 47:4}  They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
{Gen 47:4}  他们又对法老说：“迦南地的饥荒甚大，仆人的羊群没有草吃，所以我们来到这地寄居。现在求你容仆人住在歌珊地。”
{Gen 47:5}  Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.
{Gen 47:5}  法老对约瑟说：“你父亲和你弟兄到你这里来了，
{Gen 47:6}  The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them settle in the land of Goshen, and if you know any able men among them, put them in charge of my livestock."
{Gen 47:6}  埃及地都在你面前，只管叫你父亲和你弟兄住在国中最好的地；他们可以住在歌珊地。你若知道他们中间有什么能人，就派他们看管我的牲畜。”
{Gen 47:7}  Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and stood him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
{Gen 47:7}  约瑟领他父亲雅各进到法老面前，雅各就给法老祝福。
{Gen 47:8}  And Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many are the days of the years of your life?"
{Gen 47:8}  法老问雅各说：“你平生的年日是多少呢？”
{Gen 47:9}  And Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my sojourning are 130 years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning."
{Gen 47:9}  雅各对法老说：“我寄居在世的年日是一百三十岁，我平生的年日又少又苦，不及我列祖早在世寄居的年日。”
{Gen 47:10} And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
{Gen 47:10} 雅各又给法老祝福，就从法老面前出去了。
{Gen 47:11} Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
{Gen 47:11} 约瑟遵着法老的命，把埃及国最好的地，就是兰塞境内的地，给他父亲和弟兄居住，作为产业。
{Gen 47:12} And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their dependents.
{Gen 47:12} 约瑟用粮食奉养他父亲和他弟兄，并他父亲全家的眷属，都是照各家的人口奉养他们。
{Gen 47:13} Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine.
{Gen 47:13} 饥荒甚大，全地都绝了粮，甚至埃及地和迦南地的人因那饥荒的缘故都饿昏了。
{Gen 47:14} And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, in exchange for the grain that they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
{Gen 47:14} 约瑟收聚了埃及地和迦南地所有的银子，就是众人籴粮的银子，约瑟就把那银子带到法老的宫里。
{Gen 47:15} And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone."
{Gen 47:15} 埃及地和迦南地的银子都花尽了，埃及众人都来见约瑟，说：“我们的银子都用尽了，求你给我们粮食，我们为什么死在你面前呢？”
{Gen 47:16} And Joseph answered, "Give your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone."
{Gen 47:16} 约瑟说：“若是银子用尽了，可以把你们的牲畜给我，我就为你们的牲畜给你们粮食。”
{Gen 47:17} So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the donkeys. He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.
{Gen 47:17} 于是他们把牲畜赶到约瑟那里，约瑟就拿粮食换了他们的牛、羊、驴、马；那一年因换他们一切的牲畜，就用粮食养活他们。
{Gen 47:18} And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent. The herds of livestock are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our land.
{Gen 47:18} 那一年过去，第二年他们又来见约瑟，说：“我们不瞒我主，我们的银子都花尽了，牲畜也都归了我主。我们在我主眼前，除了我们的身体和田地之外，一无所剩。
{Gen 47:19} Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we with our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate."
{Gen 47:19} 你何忍见我们人死地荒呢？求你用粮食买我们的我们的地，我们和我们的地就要给法老效力。又求你给我们种子，使我们得以存活，不至死亡，地土也不至荒凉。”
{Gen 47:20} So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for all the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe on them. The land became Pharaoh's.
{Gen 47:20} 于是，约瑟为法老买了埃及所有的地，埃及人因被饥荒所迫，各都卖了自己的田地；那地就都归了法老。
{Gen 47:21} As for the people, he made servants of them from one end of Egypt to the other.
{Gen 47:21} 至于百姓，约瑟叫他们，从埃及这边直到埃及那边，都各归各城。
{Gen 47:22} Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.
{Gen 47:22} 惟有祭司的地，约瑟没有买，因为祭司有从法老所得的常俸。他们吃法老所给的常俸，所以他们不卖自己的地。
{Gen 47:23} Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.
{Gen 47:23} 约瑟对百姓说：“我今日为法老买了你们和你们的地，看哪，这里有种子给你们，你们可以种地。
{Gen 47:24} And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones."
{Gen 47:24} 后来打粮食的时候，你们要把五分之一纳给法老，四分可以归你们做地里的种子，也做你们和你们家口孩童的食物。”
{Gen 47:25} And they said, "You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh."
{Gen 47:25} 他们说：“你救了我们的性命。但愿我们在我主眼前蒙恩，我们就作法老的仆人。”
{Gen 47:26} So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.
{Gen 47:26} 于是约瑟为埃及地定下常例，直到今日：法老必得五分之一，惟独祭司的地不归法老。
{Gen 47:27} Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.
{Gen 47:27} 以色列人住在埃及的歌珊地。他们在那里置了产业，并且生育甚多。
{Gen 47:28} And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years.
{Gen 47:28} 雅各住在埃及地十七年，雅各平生的年日是一百四十七岁。
{Gen 47:29} And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt,
{Gen 47:29} 以色列的死期临近了，他就叫了他儿子约瑟来，说：“我若在你眼前蒙恩，请你把手放在我大腿底下，用慈爱和诚实待我，请你不要将我葬在埃及。
{Gen 47:30} but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place." He answered, "I will do as you have said."
{Gen 47:30} 我与我祖我父同睡的时候，你要将我带出埃及，葬在他们所葬的地方。”约瑟说：“我必遵着你的命而行。”
{Gen 47:31} And he said, "Swear to me"; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed.
{Gen 47:31} 雅各说：“你要向我起誓。”约瑟就向他起了誓，于是以色列在床头上（或作：扶着杖头）敬拜神。
{Gen 48:1}  After this, Joseph was told, "Behold, your father is ill." So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
{Gen 48:1}  这事以后，有人告诉约瑟说：“你的父亲病了。”他就带着两个儿子玛拿西和以法莲同去。
{Gen 48:2}  And it was told to Jacob, "Your son Joseph has come to you." Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed.
{Gen 48:2}  有人告诉雅各说：“请看，你儿子约瑟到你这里来了。”以色列就勉强在床上坐起来。
{Gen 48:3}  And Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,
{Gen 48:3}  雅各对约瑟说：“全能的神曾在迦南地的路斯向我显现，赐福与我，
{Gen 48:4}  and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.'
{Gen 48:4}  对我说：‘我必使你生养众多，成为多民，又要把这地赐给你的后裔，永远为业。’
{Gen 48:5}  And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.
{Gen 48:5}  我未到埃及见你之先，你在埃及地所生的以法莲和玛拿西这两个儿子是我的，正如流便和西缅是我的一样。
{Gen 48:6}  And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
{Gen 48:6}  你在他们以后所生的就是你的，他们可以归于他们弟兄的名下得产业。
{Gen 48:7}  As for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."
{Gen 48:7}  至于我，我从巴但来的时候，拉结死在我眼前，在迦南地的路上，离以法他还有一段路程，我就把他葬在以法他的路上（以法他就是伯利恒）。”
{Gen 48:8}  When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, "Who are these?"
{Gen 48:8}  以色列看见约瑟的两个儿子，就说：“这是谁？”
{Gen 48:9}  Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." And he said, "Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them."
{Gen 48:9}  约瑟对他父亲说：“这是神在这里赐给我的儿子。”以色列说：“请你领他们到我跟前，我要给他们祝福。”
{Gen 48:10} Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
{Gen 48:10} 以色列年纪老迈，眼睛昏花，不能看见。约瑟领他们到他跟前，他就和他们亲嘴，抱着他们。
{Gen 48:11} And Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face; and behold, God has let me see your offspring also."
{Gen 48:11} 以色列对约瑟说：“我想不到得见你的面，不料，神又使我得见你的儿子。”
{Gen 48:12} Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
{Gen 48:12} 约瑟把两个儿子从以色列两膝中领出来，自己就脸伏于地下拜。
{Gen 48:13} And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him.
{Gen 48:13} 随后，约瑟又拉着他们两个，以法莲在他的右手里，对着以色列的左手，玛拿西在他的左手里，对着以色列的右手，领他们到以色列的跟前。
{Gen 48:14} And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands (for Manasseh was the firstborn).
{Gen 48:14} 以色列伸出右手来，按在以法莲的头上（以法莲乃是次子），又剪搭过左手来，按在玛拿西的头上（玛拿西原是长子）。
{Gen 48:15} And he blessed Joseph and said, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,
{Gen 48:15} 他就给约瑟祝福说：“愿我祖亚伯拉罕和我父以撒所事奉的神，就是一生牧养我直到今日的神，
{Gen 48:16} the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; and in them let my name be carried on, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
{Gen 48:16} 救赎我脱离一切患难的那使者，赐福与这两个童子。愿他们归在我的名下和我祖亚伯拉罕、我父以撒的名下。又愿他们在世界中生养众多。”
{Gen 48:17} When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
{Gen 48:17} 约瑟见他父亲把右手按在以法莲的头上，就不喜悦，便提起他父亲的手，要从以法莲的头上挪到玛拿西的头上。
{Gen 48:18} And Joseph said to his father, "Not this way, my father; since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head."
{Gen 48:18} 约瑟对他父亲说：“我父，不是这样。这本是长子，求你把右手按在他的头上。”
{Gen 48:19} But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations."
{Gen 48:19} 他父亲不从，说：“我知道，我儿，我知道。他也必成为一族，也必昌大。只是他的兄弟将来比他还大；他兄弟的后裔要成为多族。”
{Gen 48:20} So he blessed them that day, saying, "By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, 'God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.'" Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
{Gen 48:20} 当日就给他们祝福说：“以色列人要指着你们祝福说：‘愿神使你如以法莲、玛拿西一样。’”于是立以法莲在玛拿西以上。
{Gen 48:21} Then Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.
{Gen 48:21} 以色列又对约瑟说：“我要死了，但神必与你们同在，领你们回到你们列祖之地。
{Gen 48:22} Moreover, I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow."
{Gen 48:22} 并且我从前用弓用刀从亚摩利人手下夺的那块地，我都赐给你，使你比众弟兄多得一分。”
{Gen 49:1}  Then Jacob called his sons and said, "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come.
{Gen 49:1}  雅各叫了他的儿子们来，说：“你们都来聚集，我好把你们日后必遇的事告诉你们。
{Gen 49:2}  "Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob, listen to Israel your father.
{Gen 49:2}  雅各的儿子们，你们要聚集而听，要听你们父亲以色列的话。
{Gen 49:3}  "Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the firstfruits of my strength, preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.
{Gen 49:3}  流便哪，你是我的长子，是我力量强壮的时候生的，本当大有尊荣，权力超众。
{Gen 49:4}  Unstable as water, you shall not have preeminence, because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it--he went up to my couch!
{Gen 49:4}  但你放纵情欲，滚沸如水，必不得居首位；因为你上了你父亲的床，污秽了我的榻。
{Gen 49:5}  "Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords.
{Gen 49:5}  西缅和利未是弟兄；他们的刀剑是残忍的器具。

{Gen 49:6}  我的灵啊，不要与他们同谋；我的心哪，不要与他们联络；因为他们趁怒杀害人命，任意砍断牛腿大筋。
{Gen 49:7}  Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.
{Gen 49:7}  他们的怒气暴烈可咒；他们的忿恨残忍可诅。我要使他们分居在雅各家里，散住在以色列地中。

{Gen 49:10} 圭必不离犹大，杖必不离他两脚之间，直等细罗（就是赐平安者）来到，万民都必归顺。
{Gen 49:11} Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey's colt to the choice vine, he has washed his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes.

{Gen 49:30} in the cave that is in the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place.
{Gen 49:30} 就是在迦南地幔利前、麦比拉田间的洞；那洞和田是亚伯拉罕向赫人以弗仑买来为业，作坟地的。
{Gen 49:31} There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah--
{Gen 49:31} 他们在那里葬了亚伯拉罕和他妻撒拉，又在那里葬了以撒和他的妻子利百加；我也在那里葬了利亚。

{Gen 50:1}  约瑟伏在他父亲的面上哀哭，与他亲嘴。
{Gen 50:2}  And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
{Gen 50:2}  约瑟吩咐伺候他的医生用香料薰他父亲，医生就用香料薰了以色列。
{Gen 50:3}  Forty days were required for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
{Gen 50:3}  薰尸的常例是四十天；那四十天满了，埃及人为他哀哭了七十天。
{Gen 50:4}  And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
{Gen 50:4}  为他哀哭的日子过了，约瑟对法老家中的人说：“我若在你们眼前蒙恩，请你们报告法老说：
{Gen 50:5}  'My father made me swear, saying, "I am about to die: in my tomb that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me." Now therefore, let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return.'"
{Gen 50:5}  ‘我父亲要死的时候叫我起誓说：你要将我葬在迦南地，在我为自己所掘的坟墓里。’现在求你让我上去葬我父亲，以后我必回来。”
{Gen 50:6}  And Pharaoh answered, "Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear."
{Gen 50:6}  法老说：“你可以上去，照着你父亲叫你起的誓，将他葬埋。”
{Gen 50:7}  So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
{Gen 50:7}  于是约瑟上去葬他父亲。与他一同上去的，有法老的臣仆和法老家中的长老，并埃及国的长老，
{Gen 50:8}  as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household. Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen.
{Gen 50:8}  还有约瑟的全家和他的弟兄们，并他父亲的眷属；只有他们的妇人孩子，和羊群牛群，都留在歌珊地。
{Gen 50:9}  And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.
{Gen 50:9}  又有车辆马兵，和他一同上去；那一帮人甚多。
{Gen 50:10} When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation, and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
{Gen 50:10} 他们到了约但河外、亚达的禾场，就在那里大大的号啕痛哭。约瑟为他父亲哀哭了七天。
{Gen 50:11} When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians." Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan.
{Gen 50:11} 迦南的居民见亚达禾场上的哀哭，就说：“这是埃及人一场大的哀哭。”因此那地方名叫亚伯麦西，是在约但河东。
{Gen 50:12} Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them,
{Gen 50:12} 雅各的儿子们就遵着他父亲所吩咐的办了，
{Gen 50:13} for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place.
{Gen 50:13} 把他搬到迦南地，葬在幔利前、麦比拉田间的洞里；那洞和田是亚伯拉罕向赫人以弗仑买来为业，作坟地的。
{Gen 50:14} After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
{Gen 50:14} 约瑟葬了他父亲以后，就和众弟兄，并一切同他上去葬他父亲的人，都回埃及去了。
{Gen 50:15} When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him."
{Gen 50:15} 约瑟的哥哥们见父亲死了，就说：“或者约瑟怀恨我们，照着我们从前待他一切的恶足足地报复我们。”
{Gen 50:16} So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave this command before he died:
{Gen 50:16} 他们就打发人去见约瑟，说：“你父亲未死以先吩咐说：
{Gen 50:17} 'Say to Joseph, "Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you."' And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father." Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
{Gen 50:17} ‘你们要对约瑟这样说：从前你哥哥们恶待你，求你饶恕他们的过犯和罪恶。’如今求你饶恕你父亲神之仆人的过犯。”他们对约瑟说这话，约瑟就哭了。
{Gen 50:18} His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, "Behold, we are your servants."
{Gen 50:18} 他的哥哥们又来俯伏在他面前，说：“我们是你的仆人。”
{Gen 50:19} But Joseph said to them, "Do not fear, for am I in the place of God?
{Gen 50:19} 约瑟对他们说：“不要害怕，我岂能代替神呢？
{Gen 50:20} As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.
{Gen 50:20} 从前你们的意思是要害我，但神的意思原是好的，要保全许多人的性命，成就今日的光景。
{Gen 50:21} So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones." Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
{Gen 50:21} 现在你们不要害怕，我必养活你们和你们的妇人孩子。”于是约瑟用亲爱的话安慰他们。
{Gen 50:22} So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father's house. Joseph lived 110 years.
{Gen 50:22} 约瑟和他父亲的眷属都住在埃及。约瑟活了一百一十岁。
{Gen 50:23} And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were counted as Joseph's own.
{Gen 50:23} 约瑟得见以法莲第三代的子孙。玛拿西的孙子、玛吉的儿子也养在约瑟的膝上。
{Gen 50:24} And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
{Gen 50:24} 约瑟对他弟兄们说：“我要死了，但神必定看顾你们，领你们从这地上去，到他起誓所应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各之地。”
{Gen 50:25} Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."
{Gen 50:25} 约瑟叫以色列的子孙起誓说：“神必定看顾你们；你们要把我的骸骨从这里搬上去。”
{Gen 50:26} So Joseph died, being 110 years old. They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
{Gen 50:26} 约瑟死了，正一百一十岁。人用香料将他薰了，把他收殓在棺材里，停在埃及。
