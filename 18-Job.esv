{Job 1:1}   There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.
{Job 1:1}   乌斯地有一个人名叫约伯；那人完全正直，敬畏神，远离恶事。
{Job 1:2}   There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
{Job 1:2}   他生了七个儿子，三个女儿。
{Job 1:3}   He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.
{Job 1:3}   他的家产有七千羊，三千骆驼，五百对牛，五百母驴，并有许多仆婢。这人在东方人中就为至大。
{Job 1:4}   His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
{Job 1:4}   他的儿子按着日子各在自己家里设摆筵宴，就打发人去，请了他们的三个姊妹来，与他们一同吃喝。
{Job 1:5}   And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts." Thus Job did continually.
{Job 1:5}   筵宴的日子过了，约伯打发人去叫他们自洁。他清早起来，按着他们众人的数目献燔祭；因为他说：“恐怕我儿子犯了罪，心中弃掉神。”约伯常常这样行。
{Job 1:6}   Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.
{Job 1:6}   有一天，神的众子来侍立在耶和华面前，撒但也来在其中。
{Job 1:7}   The LORD said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."
{Job 1:7}   耶和华问撒但说：“你从那里来？”撒但回答说：“我从地上走来走去，往返而来。”
{Job 1:8}   And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?"
{Job 1:8}   耶和华问撒但说：“你曾用心察看我的仆人约伯没有？地上再没有人像他完全正直，敬畏神，远离恶事。”
{Job 1:9}   Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "Does Job fear God for no reason?
{Job 1:9}   撒但回答耶和华说：“约伯敬畏神，岂是无故呢？
{Job 1:10}  Have you not put a hedge around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
{Job 1:10}  你岂不是四面圈上篱笆围护他和他的家，并他一切所有的吗？他手所做的都蒙你赐福；他的家产也在地上增多。
{Job 1:11}  But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face."
{Job 1:11}  你且伸手毁他一切所有的；他必当面弃掉你。”
{Job 1:12}  And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand." So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
{Job 1:12}  耶和华对撒但说：“凡他所有的都在你手中；只是不可伸手加害于他。”于是撒但从耶和华面前退去。
{Job 1:13}  Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
{Job 1:13}  有一天，约伯的儿女正在他们长兄的家里吃饭喝酒，
{Job 1:14}  and there came a messenger to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,
{Job 1:14}  有报信的来见约伯，说：“牛正耕地，驴在旁边吃草，
{Job 1:15}  and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
{Job 1:15}  示巴人忽然闯来，把牲畜掳去，并用刀杀了仆人；惟有我一人逃脱，来报信给你。”
{Job 1:16}  While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
{Job 1:16}  他还说话的时候，又有人来说：“神从天上降下火来，将群羊和仆人都烧灭了；惟有我一人逃脱，来报信给你。”
{Job 1:17}  While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "The Chaldeans formed three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
{Job 1:17}  他还说话的时候，又有人来说：“迦勒底人分作三队忽然闯来，把骆驼掳去，并用刀杀了仆人；惟有我一人逃脱，来报信给你。”
{Job 1:18}  While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
{Job 1:18}  他还说话的时候，又有人来说：“你的儿女正在他们长兄的家里吃饭喝酒，
{Job 1:19}  and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
{Job 1:19}  不料，有狂风从旷野刮来，击打房屋的四角，房屋倒塌在少年人身上，他们就都死了；惟有我一人逃脱，来报信给你。”
{Job 1:20}  Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped.
{Job 1:20}  约伯便起来，撕裂外袍，剃了头，伏在地上下拜，
{Job 1:21}  And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."
{Job 1:21}  说：“我赤身出于母胎，也必赤身归回；赏赐的是耶和华，收取的也是耶和华。耶和华的名是应当称颂的。”
{Job 1:22}  In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.
{Job 1:22}  在这一切的事上约伯并不犯罪，也不以神为愚妄（或作：也不妄评神）。
{Job 2:1}   Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.
{Job 2:1}   又有一天，神的众子来侍立在耶和华面前，撒但也来在其中。
{Job 2:2}   And the LORD said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."
{Job 2:2}   耶和华问撒但说：“你从那里来？”撒但回答说：“我从地上走来走去，往返而来。”
{Job 2:3}   And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him without reason."
{Job 2:3}   耶和华问撒但说：“你曾用心察看我的仆人约伯没有？地上再没有人像他完全正直，敬畏神，远离恶事。你虽激动我攻击他，无故地毁灭他，他仍然持守他的纯正。”
{Job 2:4}   Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.
{Job 2:4}   撒但回答耶和华说：“人以皮代皮，情愿舍去一切所有的，保全性命。
{Job 2:5}   But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face."
{Job 2:5}   你且伸手伤他的骨头和他的肉，他必当面弃掉你。”
{Job 2:6}   And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life."
{Job 2:6}   耶和华对撒但说：“他在你手中，只要存留他的性命。”
{Job 2:7}   So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
{Job 2:7}   于是撒但从耶和华面前退去，击打约伯，使他从脚掌到头顶长毒疮。
{Job 2:8}   And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.
{Job 2:8}   约伯就坐在炉灰中，拿瓦片刮身体。
{Job 2:9}   Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die."
{Job 2:9}   他的妻子对他说：“你仍然持守你的纯正吗？你弃掉神，死了吧！”
{Job 2:10}  But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
{Job 2:10}  约伯却对他说：“你说话像愚顽的妇人一样。嗳！难道我们从神手里得福，不也受祸吗？”在这一切的事上约伯并不以口犯罪。
{Job 2:11}  Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him.
{Job 2:11}  约伯的三个朋友提幔人以利法、书亚人比勒达、拿玛人琐法听说有这一切的灾祸临到他身上，各人就从本处约会同来，为他悲伤，安慰他。
{Job 2:12}  And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.
{Job 2:12}  他们远远的举目观看，认不出他来，就放声大哭。各人撕裂外袍，把尘土向天扬起来，落在自己的头上。
{Job 2:13}  And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.
{Job 2:13}  他们就同他七天七夜坐在地上，一个人也不向他说句话，因为他极其痛苦。
{Job 3:1}   After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
{Job 3:1}   此后，约伯开口咒诅自己的生日，
{Job 3:2}   And Job said:
{Job 3:2}   说：愿我生的那日和说怀了男胎的那夜都灭没。
{Job 3:3}   "Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.'
{Job 3:3}   (SEE 3:2)
{Job 3:4}   Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it.
{Job 3:4}   愿那日变为黑暗；愿神不从上面寻找他；愿亮光不照于其上。
{Job 3:5}   Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
{Job 3:5}   愿黑暗和死荫索取那日；愿密云停在其上；愿日蚀恐吓他。
{Job 3:6}   That night--let thick darkness seize it! Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
{Job 3:6}   愿那夜被幽暗夺取，不在年中的日子同乐，也不入月中的数目。
{Job 3:7}   Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry enter it.
{Job 3:7}   愿那夜没有生育，其间也没有欢乐的声音。
{Job 3:8}   Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan.
{Job 3:8}   愿那咒诅日子且能惹动鳄鱼的咒诅那夜。
{Job 3:9}   Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning,
{Job 3:9}   愿那夜黎明的星宿变为黑暗，盼亮却不亮，也不见早晨的光线（原文作眼皮）；
{Job 3:10}  because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.
{Job 3:10}  因没有把怀我胎的门关闭，也没有将患难对我的眼隐藏。
{Job 3:11}  "Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire?
{Job 3:11}  我为何不出母胎而死？为何不出母腹绝气？
{Job 3:12}  Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?
{Job 3:12}  为何有膝接收我？为何有奶哺养我？
{Job 3:13}  For then I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,
{Job 3:13}  不然，我就早已躺卧安睡，
{Job 3:14}  with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves,
{Job 3:14}  和地上为自己重造荒邱的君王、谋士，
{Job 3:15}  or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
{Job 3:15}  或与有金子、将银子装满了房屋的王子一同安息；
{Job 3:16}  Or why was I not as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light?
{Job 3:16}  或像隐而未现、不到期而落的胎，归于无有，如同未见光的婴孩。
{Job 3:17}  There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.
{Job 3:17}  在那里恶人止息搅扰，困乏人得享安息，
{Job 3:18}  There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
{Job 3:18}  被囚的人同得安逸，不听见督工的声音。
{Job 3:19}  The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.
{Job 3:19}  大小都在那里；奴仆脱离主人的辖制。
{Job 3:20}  "Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,
{Job 3:20}  受患难的人为何有光赐给他呢？心中愁苦的人为何有生命赐给他呢？
{Job 3:21}  who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
{Job 3:21}  他们切望死，却不得死；求死，胜于求隐藏的珍宝。
{Job 3:22}  who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they find the grave?
{Job 3:22}  他们寻见坟墓就快乐，极其欢喜。
{Job 3:23}  Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
{Job 3:23}  人的道路既然遮隐，神又把他四面围困，为何有光赐给他呢？
{Job 3:24}  For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.
{Job 3:24}  我未曾吃饭就发出叹息；我唉哼的声音涌出如水。
{Job 3:25}  For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.
{Job 3:25}  因我所恐惧的临到我身，我所惧怕的迎我而来。
{Job 3:26}  I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, but trouble comes."
{Job 3:26}  我不得安逸，不得平静，也不得安息，却有患难来到。
{Job 4:1}   Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
{Job 4:1}   提幔人以利法回答说：
{Job 4:2}   "If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? Yet who can keep from speaking?
{Job 4:2}   人若想与你说话，你就厌烦吗？但谁能忍住不说呢？
{Job 4:3}   Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.
{Job 4:3}   你素来教导许多的人，又坚固软弱的手。
{Job 4:4}   Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees.
{Job 4:4}   你的言语曾扶助那将要跌倒的人；你又使软弱的膝稳固。
{Job 4:5}   But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed.
{Job 4:5}   但现在祸患临到你，你就昏迷，挨近你，你便惊惶。
{Job 4:6}   Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?
{Job 4:6}   你的倚靠不是在你敬畏神吗？你的盼望不是在你行事纯正吗？
{Job 4:7}   "Remember: who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off?
{Job 4:7}   请你追想：无辜的人有谁灭亡？正直的人在何处剪除？
{Job 4:8}   As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.
{Job 4:8}   按我所见，耕罪孽、种毒害的人都照样收割。
{Job 4:9}   By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.
{Job 4:9}   神一出气，他们就灭亡；神一发怒，他们就消没。
{Job 4:10}  The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken.
{Job 4:10}  狮子的吼叫和猛狮的声音尽都止息；少壮狮子的牙齿也都敲掉。
{Job 4:11}  The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
{Job 4:11}  老狮子因绝食而死；母狮之子也都离散。
{Job 4:12}  "Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it.
{Job 4:12}  我暗暗的得了默示；我耳朵也听其细微的声音。
{Job 4:13}  Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
{Job 4:13}  在思念夜中、异象之间，世人沉睡的时候，
{Job 4:14}  dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.
{Job 4:14}  恐惧、战兢临到我身，使我百骨打战。
{Job 4:15}  A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.
{Job 4:15}  有灵从我面前经过，我身上的毫毛直立。
{Job 4:16}  It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice:
{Job 4:16}  那灵停住，我却不能辨其形状；有影像在我眼前。我在静默中听见有声音说：
{Job 4:17}  'Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?
{Job 4:17}  必死的人岂能比神公义吗？人岂能比造他的主洁净吗？
{Job 4:18}  Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error;
{Job 4:18}  主不信靠他的臣仆，并且指他的使者为愚昧；
{Job 4:19}  how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like the moth.
{Job 4:19}  何况那住在土房、根基在尘土里、被蠹虫所毁坏的人呢？
{Job 4:20}  Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; they perish forever without anyone regarding it.
{Job 4:20}  早晚之间，就被毁灭，永归无有，无人理会。
{Job 4:21}  Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?'
{Job 4:21}  他帐棚的绳索岂不从中抽出来呢？他死，且是无智慧而死。
{Job 5:1}   "Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
{Job 5:1}   你且呼求，有谁答应你？诸圣者之中，你转向那一位呢？
{Job 5:2}   Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple.
{Job 5:2}   忿怒害死愚妄人；嫉妒杀死痴迷人。
{Job 5:3}   I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.
{Job 5:3}   我曾见愚妄人扎下根，但我忽然咒诅他的住处。
{Job 5:4}   His children are far from safety; they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them.
{Job 5:4}   他的儿女远离稳妥的地步，在城门口被压，并无人搭救。
{Job 5:5}   The hungry eat his harvest, and he takes it even out of thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
{Job 5:5}   他的庄稼有饥饿的人吃尽了，就是在荆棘里的也抢去了；他的财宝有网罗张口吞灭了。
{Job 5:6}   For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground,
{Job 5:6}   祸患原不是从土中出来；患难也不是从地里发生。
{Job 5:7}   but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.
{Job 5:7}   人生在世必遇患难，如同火星飞腾。
{Job 5:8}   "As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I commit my cause,
{Job 5:8}   至于我，我必仰望神，把我的事情托付他。
{Job 5:9}   who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number:
{Job 5:9}   他行大事不可测度，行奇事不可胜数：
{Job 5:10}  he gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields;
{Job 5:10}  降雨在地上，赐水于田里；
{Job 5:11}  he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
{Job 5:11}  将卑微的安置在高处，将哀痛的举到稳妥之地；
{Job 5:12}  He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
{Job 5:12}  破坏狡猾人的计谋，使他们所谋的不得成就。
{Job 5:13}  He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end.
{Job 5:13}  他叫有智慧的中了自己的诡计，使狡诈人的计谋速速灭亡。
{Job 5:14}  They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night.
{Job 5:14}  他们白昼遇见黑暗，午间摸索如在夜间。
{Job 5:15}  But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth and from the hand of the mighty.
{Job 5:15}  神拯救穷乏人脱离他们口中的刀和强暴人的手。
{Job 5:16}  So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.
{Job 5:16}  这样，贫寒的人有指望，罪孽之辈必塞口无言。
{Job 5:17}  "Behold, blessed is the one whom God reproves; therefore despise not the discipline of the Almighty.
{Job 5:17}  神所惩治的人是有福的！所以你不可轻看全能者的管教。
{Job 5:18}  For he wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal.
{Job 5:18}  因为他打破，又缠裹；他击伤，用手医治。
{Job 5:19}  He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no evil shall touch you.
{Job 5:19}  你六次遭难，他必救你；就是七次，灾祸也无法害你。
{Job 5:20}  In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.
{Job 5:20}  在饥荒中，他必救你脱离死亡；在争战中，他必救你脱离刀剑的权力。
{Job 5:21}  You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes.
{Job 5:21}  你必被隐藏，不受口舌之害；灾殃临到，你也不惧怕。
{Job 5:22}  At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the beasts of the earth.
{Job 5:22}  你遇见灾害饥馑，就必嬉笑；地上的野兽，你也不惧怕。
{Job 5:23}  For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
{Job 5:23}  因为你必与田间的石头立约；田里的野兽也必与你和好。
{Job 5:24}  You shall know that your tent is at peace, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing.
{Job 5:24}  你必知道你帐棚平安，要查看你的羊圈，一无所失；
{Job 5:25}  You shall know also that your offspring shall be many, and your descendants as the grass of the earth.
{Job 5:25}  也必知道你的后裔将来发达，你的子孙像地上的青草。
{Job 5:26}  You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, like a sheaf gathered up in its season.
{Job 5:26}  你必寿高年迈才归坟墓，好像禾捆到时收藏。
{Job 5:27}  Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear, and know it for your good."
{Job 5:27}  这理，我们已经考察，本是如此。你须要听，要知道是与自己有益。
{Job 6:1}   Then Job answered and said:
{Job 6:1}   约伯回答说：
{Job 6:2}   "Oh that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!
{Job 6:2}   惟愿我的烦恼称一称，我一切的灾害放在天平里；
{Job 6:3}   For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.
{Job 6:3}   现今都比海沙更重，所以我的言语急躁。
{Job 6:4}   For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
{Job 6:4}   因全能者的箭射入我身；其毒，我的灵喝尽了；神的惊吓摆阵攻击我。
{Job 6:5}   Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder?
{Job 6:5}   野驴有草岂能叫唤？牛有料岂能吼叫？
{Job 6:6}   Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow?
{Job 6:6}   物淡而无盐岂可吃吗？蛋青有什么滋味呢？
{Job 6:7}   My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me.
{Job 6:7}   看为可厌的食物，我心不肯挨近。
{Job 6:8}   "Oh that I might have my request, and that God would fulfill my hope,
{Job 6:8}   惟愿我得着所求的，愿神赐我所切望的；
{Job 6:9}   that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!
{Job 6:9}   就是愿神把我压碎，伸手将我剪除。
{Job 6:10}  This would be my comfort; I would even exult in pain unsparing, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
{Job 6:10}  我因没有违弃那圣者的言语，就仍以此为安慰，在不止息的痛苦中还可踊跃。
{Job 6:11}  What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?
{Job 6:11}  我有什么气力使我等候？我有什么结局使我忍耐？
{Job 6:12}  Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?
{Job 6:12}  我的气力岂是石头的气力？我的肉身岂是铜的呢？
{Job 6:13}  Have I any help in me, when resource is driven from me?
{Job 6:13}  在我岂不是毫无帮助吗？智慧岂不是从我心中赶出净尽吗？
{Job 6:14}  "He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
{Job 6:14}  那将要灰心、离弃全能者、不敬畏神的人，他的朋友当以慈爱待他。
{Job 6:15}  My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams that pass away,
{Job 6:15}  我的弟兄诡诈，好像溪水，又像溪水流干的河道。
{Job 6:16}  which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself.
{Job 6:16}  这河因结冰发黑，有雪藏在其中；

{Job 6:22}  Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?
{Job 6:22}  我岂说：请你们供给我，从你们的财物中送礼物给我？
{Job 6:23}  Or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless'?
{Job 6:23}  岂说：拯救我脱离敌人的手吗？救赎我脱离强暴人的手吗？
{Job 6:24}  "Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone astray.
{Job 6:24}  请你们教导我，我便不作声；使我明白在何事上有错。
{Job 6:25}  How forceful are upright words! But what does reproof from you reprove?
{Job 6:25}  正直的言语力量何其大！但你们责备是责备什么呢？
{Job 6:26}  Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind?
{Job 6:26}  绝望人的讲论既然如风，你们还想要驳正言语吗？
{Job 6:27}  You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend.

{Job 6:29}  请你们转意，不要不公；请再转意，我的事有理。
{Job 6:30}  Is there any injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity?
{Job 6:30}  我的舌上岂有不义吗？我的口里岂不辨奸恶吗？
{Job 7:1}   "Has not man a hard service on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired hand?
{Job 7:1}   人在世上岂无争战吗？他的日子不像雇工人的日子吗？
{Job 7:2}   Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like a hired hand who looks for his wages,
{Job 7:2}   像奴仆切慕黑影，像雇工人盼望工价；
{Job 7:3}   so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me.
{Job 7:3}   我也照样经过困苦的日月，夜间的疲乏为我而定。

{Job 7:9}   As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up;

{Job 7:10}  he returns no more to his house, nor does his place know him anymore.
{Job 7:10}  他不再回自己的家；故土也不再认识他。
{Job 7:11}  "Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
{Job 7:11}  我不禁止我口；我灵愁苦，要发出言语；我心苦恼，要吐露哀情。
{Job 7:12}  Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me?
{Job 7:12}  我对神说：我岂是洋海，岂是大鱼，你竟防守我呢？
{Job 7:13}  When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,'
{Job 7:13}  若说：我的床必安慰我，我的榻必解释我的苦情，
{Job 7:14}  then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
{Job 7:14}  你就用梦惊骇我，用异象恐吓我，
{Job 7:15}  so that I would choose strangling and death rather than my bones.
{Job 7:15}  甚至我宁肯噎死，宁肯死亡，胜似留我这一身的骨头。
{Job 7:16}  I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.
{Job 7:16}  我厌弃性命，不愿永活。你任凭我吧，因我的日子都是虚空。
{Job 7:17}  What is man, that you make so much of him, and that you set your heart on him,
{Job 7:17}  人算什么，你竟看他为大，将他放在心上？
{Job 7:18}  visit him every morning and test him every moment?
{Job 7:18}  每早晨鉴察他，时刻试验他？
{Job 7:19}  How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my spit?
{Job 7:19}  你到何时才转眼不看我，才任凭我咽下唾沫呢？
{Job 7:20}  If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of mankind? Why have you made me your mark? Why have I become a burden to you?
{Job 7:20}  鉴察人的主啊，我若有罪，于你何妨？为何以我当你的箭靶子，使我厌弃自己的性命？
{Job 7:21}  Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now I shall lie in the earth; you will seek me, but I shall not be."
{Job 7:21}  为何不赦免我的过犯，除掉我的罪孽？我现今要躺卧在尘土中；你要殷勤地寻找我，我却不在了。
{Job 8:1}   Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
{Job 8:1}   书亚人比勒达回答说：
{Job 8:2}   "How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind?
{Job 8:2}   这些话你要说到几时？口中的言语如狂风要到几时呢？
{Job 8:3}   Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right?
{Job 8:3}   神岂能偏离公平？全能者岂能偏离公义？
{Job 8:4}   If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.
{Job 8:4}   或者你的儿女得罪了他；他使他们受报应。
{Job 8:5}   If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy,
{Job 8:5}   你若殷勤地寻求神，向全能者恳求；
{Job 8:6}   if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation.
{Job 8:6}   你若清洁正直，他必定为你起来，使你公义的居所兴旺。
{Job 8:7}   And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great.
{Job 8:7}   你起初虽然微小，终久必甚发达。
{Job 8:8}   "For inquire, please, of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers have searched out.
{Job 8:8}   请你考问前代，追念他们的列祖所查究的。
{Job 8:9}   For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our days on earth are a shadow.
{Job 8:9}   我们不过从昨日才有，一无所知；我们在世的日子好像影儿。
{Job 8:10}  Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding?
{Job 8:10}  他们岂不指教你，告诉你，从心里发出言语来呢？
{Job 8:11}  "Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water?
{Job 8:11}  蒲草没有泥岂能发长？芦荻没有水岂能生发？
{Job 8:12}  While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant.
{Job 8:12}  尚青的时候，还没有割下，比百样的草先枯槁。
{Job 8:13}  Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish.
{Job 8:13}  凡忘记神的人，景况也是这样；不虔敬人的指望要灭没。
{Job 8:14}  His confidence is severed, and his trust is a spider's web.
{Job 8:14}  他所仰赖的必折断；他所倚靠的是蜘蛛网。
{Job 8:15}  He leans against his house, but it does not stand; he lays hold of it, but it does not endure.
{Job 8:15}  他要倚靠房屋，房屋却站立不住；他要抓住房屋，房屋却不能存留。
{Job 8:16}  He is a lush plant before the sun, and his shoots spread over his garden.
{Job 8:16}  他在日光之下发青，蔓子爬满了园子；
{Job 8:17}  His roots entwine the stone heap; he looks upon a house of stones.
{Job 8:17}  他的根盘绕石堆，扎入石地。
{Job 8:18}  If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I have never seen you.'
{Job 8:18}  他若从本地被拔出，那地就不认识他，说：我没有见过你。
{Job 8:19}  Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the soil others will spring.
{Job 8:19}  看哪，这就是他道中之乐；以后必另有人从地而生。
{Job 8:20}  "Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers.
{Job 8:20}  神必不丢弃完全人，也不扶助邪恶人。
{Job 8:21}  He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting.
{Job 8:21}  他还要以喜笑充满你的口，以欢呼充满你的嘴。
{Job 8:22}  Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more."
{Job 8:22}  恨恶你的要披戴惭愧；恶人的帐棚必归于无有。
{Job 9:1}   Then Job answered and said:
{Job 9:1}   约伯回答说：
{Job 9:2}   "Truly I know that it is so: But how can a man be in the right before God?
{Job 9:2}   我真知道是这样；但人在神面前怎能成为义呢？
{Job 9:3}   If one wished to contend with him, one could not answer him once in a thousand times.
{Job 9:3}   若愿意与他争辩，千中之一也不能回答。
{Job 9:4}   He is wise in heart and mighty in strength --who has hardened himself against him, and succeeded?--
{Job 9:4}   他心里有智慧，且大有能力。谁向神刚硬而得亨通呢？
{Job 9:5}   he who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he overturns them in his anger,
{Job 9:5}   他发怒，把山翻倒挪移，山并不知觉。
{Job 9:6}   who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble;
{Job 9:6}   他使地震动，离其本位，地的柱子就摇撼。
{Job 9:7}   who commands the sun, and it does not rise; who seals up the stars;
{Job 9:7}   他吩咐日头不出来，就不出来，又封闭众星。
{Job 9:8}   who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea;
{Job 9:8}   他独自铺张苍天，步行在海浪之上。
{Job 9:9}   who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the chambers of the south;
{Job 9:9}   他造北斗、参星、昴星，并南方的密宫；
{Job 9:10}  who does great things beyond searching out, and marvelous things beyond number.
{Job 9:10}  他行大事，不可测度，行奇事，不可胜数。
{Job 9:11}  Behold, he passes by me, and I see him not; he moves on, but I do not perceive him.
{Job 9:11}  他从我旁边经过，我却不看见；他在我面前行走，我倒不知觉。
{Job 9:12}  Behold, he snatches away; who can turn him back? Who will say to him, 'What are you doing?'
{Job 9:12}  他夺取，谁能阻挡？谁敢问他：你做什么？
{Job 9:13}  "God will not turn back his anger; beneath him bowed the helpers of Rahab.
{Job 9:13}  神必不收回他的怒气；扶助拉哈伯的，屈身在他以下。
{Job 9:14}  How then can I answer him, choosing my words with him?
{Job 9:14}  既是这样，我怎敢回答他，怎敢选择言语与他辩论呢？
{Job 9:15}  Though I am in the right, I cannot answer him; I must appeal for mercy to my accuser.
{Job 9:15}  我虽有义，也不回答他，只要向那审判我的恳求。
{Job 9:16}  If I summoned him and he answered me, I would not believe that he was listening to my voice.
{Job 9:16}  我若呼吁，他应允我；我仍不信他真听我的声音。
{Job 9:17}  For he crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause;
{Job 9:17}  他用暴风折断我，无故地加增我的损伤。
{Job 9:18}  he will not let me get my breath, but fills me with bitterness.
{Job 9:18}  我就是喘一口气，他都不容，倒使我满心苦恼。
{Job 9:19}  If it is a contest of strength, behold, he is mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him?
{Job 9:19}  若论力量，他真有能力！若论审判，他说谁能将我传来呢？
{Job 9:20}  Though I am in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse.
{Job 9:20}  我虽有义，自己的口要定我为有罪；我虽完全，我口必显我为弯曲。
{Job 9:21}  I am blameless; I regard not myself; I loathe my life.
{Job 9:21}  我本完全，不顾自己；我厌恶我的性命。
{Job 9:22}  It is all one; therefore I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'
{Job 9:22}  善恶无分，都是一样；所以我说，完全人和恶人，他都灭绝。
{Job 9:23}  When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent.
{Job 9:23}  若忽然遭杀害之祸，他必戏笑无辜的人遇难。
{Job 9:24}  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the faces of its judges-- if it is not he, who then is it?
{Job 9:24}  世界交在恶人手中；蒙蔽世界审判官的脸，若不是他，是谁呢？
{Job 9:25}  "My days are swifter than a runner; they flee away; they see no good.
{Job 9:25}  我的日子比跑信的更快，急速过去，不见福乐。
{Job 9:26}  They go by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping on the prey.
{Job 9:26}  我的日子过去如快船，如急落抓食的鹰。
{Job 9:27}  If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and be of good cheer,'
{Job 9:27}  我若说：我要忘记我的哀情，除去我的愁容，心中畅快；
{Job 9:28}  I become afraid of all my suffering, for I know you will not hold me innocent.
{Job 9:28}  我因愁苦而惧怕，知道你必不以我为无辜。
{Job 9:29}  I shall be condemned; why then do I labor in vain?
{Job 9:29}  我必被你定为有罪，我何必徒然劳苦呢？
{Job 9:30}  If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,
{Job 9:30}  我若用雪水洗身，用硷洁净我的手，
{Job 9:31}  yet you will plunge me into a pit, and my own clothes will abhor me.
{Job 9:31}  你还要扔我在坑里，我的衣服都憎恶我。
{Job 9:32}  For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together.
{Job 9:32}  他本不像我是人，使我可以回答他，又使我们可以同听审判。
{Job 9:33}  There is no arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both.
{Job 9:33}  我们中间没有听讼的人可以向我们两造按手。
{Job 9:34}  Let him take his rod away from me, and let not dread of him terrify me.
{Job 9:34}  愿他把杖离开我，不使惊惶威吓我。
{Job 9:35}  Then I would speak without fear of him, for I am not so in myself.
{Job 9:35}  我就说话，也不惧怕他，现在我却不是那样。
{Job 10:1}  "I loathe my life; I will give free utterance to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
{Job 10:1}  我厌烦我的性命，必由着自己述说我的哀情；因心里苦恼，我要说话，
{Job 10:2}  I will say to God, Do not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me.
{Job 10:2}  对神说：不要定我有罪，要指示我，你为何与我争辩？
{Job 10:3}  Does it seem good to you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands and favor the designs of the wicked?
{Job 10:3}  你手所造的，你又欺压，又藐视，却光照恶人的计谋。这事你以为美吗？
{Job 10:4}  Have you eyes of flesh? Do you see as man sees?
{Job 10:4}  你的眼岂是肉眼？你查看岂像人查看吗？
{Job 10:5}  Are your days as the days of man, or your years as a man's years,
{Job 10:5}  你的日子岂像人的日子，你的年岁岂像人的年岁，
{Job 10:6}  that you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin,
{Job 10:6}  就追问我的罪孽，寻察我的罪过吗？
{Job 10:7}  although you know that I am not guilty, and there is none to deliver out of your hand?
{Job 10:7}  其实，你知道我没有罪恶，并没有能救我脱离你手的。
{Job 10:8}  Your hands fashioned and made me, and now you have destroyed me altogether.
{Job 10:8}  你的手创造我，造就我的四肢百体，你还要毁灭我。
{Job 10:9}  Remember that you have made me like clay; and will you return me to the dust?
{Job 10:9}  求你记念制造我如抟泥一般，你还要使我归于麈土吗？
{Job 10:10} Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese?
{Job 10:10} 你不是倒出我来好像奶，使我凝结如同奶饼吗？
{Job 10:11} You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.
{Job 10:11} 你以皮和肉为衣给我穿上，用骨与筋把我全体联络。
{Job 10:12} You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit.
{Job 10:12} 你将生命和慈爱赐给我；你也眷顾保全我的心灵。
{Job 10:13} Yet these things you hid in your heart; I know that this was your purpose.
{Job 10:13} 然而，你待我的这些事早已藏在你心里；我知道你久有此意。
{Job 10:14} If I sin, you watch me and do not acquit me of my iniquity.
{Job 10:14} 我若犯罪，你就察看我，并不赦免我的罪孽。
{Job 10:15} If I am guilty, woe to me! If I am in the right, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look on my affliction.
{Job 10:15} 我若行恶，便有了祸；我若为义，也不敢抬头，正是满心羞愧，眼见我的苦情。
{Job 10:16} And were my head lifted up, you would hunt me like a lion and again work wonders against me.
{Job 10:16} 我若昂首自得，你就追捕我如狮子，又在我身上显出奇能。
{Job 10:17} You renew your witnesses against me and increase your vexation toward me; you bring fresh troops against me.
{Job 10:17} 你重立见证攻击我，向我加增恼怒，如军兵更换着攻击我。
{Job 10:18} "Why did you bring me out from the womb? Would that I had died before any eye had seen me
{Job 10:18} 你为何使我出母胎呢？不如我当时气绝，无人得见我；
{Job 10:19} and were as though I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave.
{Job 10:19} 这样，就如没有我一般，一出母胎就被送入坟墓。
{Job 10:20} Are not my days few? Then cease, and leave me alone, that I may find a little cheer
{Job 10:20} 我的日子不是甚少吗？求你停手宽容我，叫我在往而不返之先，就是往黑暗和死荫之地以先可以稍得畅快。
{Job 10:21} before I go--and I shall not return-- to the land of darkness and deep shadow,
{Job 10:21} (SEE 10:20)
{Job 10:22} the land of gloom like thick darkness, like deep shadow without any order, where light is as thick darkness."
{Job 10:22} 那地甚是幽暗，是死荫混沌之地；那里的光好像幽暗。
{Job 11:1}  Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
{Job 11:1}  拿玛人琐法回答说：
{Job 11:2}  "Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and a man full of talk be judged right?
{Job 11:2}  这许多的言语岂不该回答吗？多嘴多舌的人岂可称为义吗？
{Job 11:3}  Should your babble silence men, and when you mock, shall no one shame you?
{Job 11:3}  你夸大的话岂能使人不作声吗？你戏笑的时候岂没有人叫你害羞吗？
{Job 11:4}  For you say, 'My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in God's eyes.'
{Job 11:4}  你说：我的道理纯全；我在你眼前洁净。
{Job 11:5}  But oh, that God would speak and open his lips to you,
{Job 11:5}  惟愿神说话；愿他开口攻击你，
{Job 11:6}  and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves.
{Job 11:6}  并将智慧的奥秘指示你；他有诸般的智识。所以当知道神追讨你比你罪孽该得的还少。
{Job 11:7}  "Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?
{Job 11:7}  你考察就能测透神吗？你岂能尽情测透全能者吗？
{Job 11:8}  It is higher than heaven--what can you do? Deeper than Sheol--what can you know?
{Job 11:8}  他的智慧高于天，你还能做什么？深于阴间，你还能知道什么？
{Job 11:9}  Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.
{Job 11:9}  其量比地长，比海宽。
{Job 11:10} If he passes through and imprisons and summons the court, who can turn him back?
{Job 11:10} 他若经过，将人拘禁，招人受审，谁能阻挡他呢？
{Job 11:11} For he knows worthless men; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it?
{Job 11:11} 他本知道虚妄的人；人的罪孽，他虽不留意，还是无所不见。
{Job 11:12} But a stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey's colt is born a man!
{Job 11:12} 空虚的人却毫无知识；人生在世好像野驴的驹子。
{Job 11:13} "If you prepare your heart, you will stretch out your hands toward him.
{Job 11:13} 你若将心安正，又向主举手；
{Job 11:14} If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not injustice dwell in your tents.
{Job 11:14} 你手里若有罪孽，就当远远的除掉，也不容非义住在你帐棚之中。
{Job 11:15} Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure and will not fear.
{Job 11:15} 那时，你必仰起脸来毫无斑点；你也必坚固，无所惧怕。
{Job 11:16} You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away.
{Job 11:16} 你必忘记你的苦楚，就是想起也如流过去的水一样。
{Job 11:17} And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.
{Job 11:17} 你在世的日子要比正午更明，虽有黑暗仍像早晨。
{Job 11:18} And you will feel secure, because there is hope; you will look around and take your rest in security.
{Job 11:18} 你因有指望就必稳固，也必四围巡查，坦然安息。
{Job 11:19} You will lie down, and none will make you afraid; many will court your favor.
{Job 11:19} 你躺卧，无人惊吓，且有许多人向你求恩。
{Job 11:20} But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last."
{Job 11:20} 但恶人的眼目必要失明。他们无路可逃；他们的指望就是气绝。
{Job 12:1}  Then Job answered and said:

{Job 15:4}  But you are doing away with the fear of God and hindering meditation before God.

{Job 15:5}  For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.

{Job 15:11} Are the comforts of God too small for you, or the word that deals gently with you?
{Job 15:11} 神用温和的话安慰你，你以为太小吗？
{Job 15:12} Why does your heart carry you away, and why do your eyes flash,
{Job 15:12} 你的心为何将你逼去？你的眼为何冒出火星，
{Job 15:13} that you turn your spirit against God and bring such words out of your mouth?
{Job 15:13} 使你的灵反对神，也任你的口发这言语？
{Job 15:14} What is man, that he can be pure? Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?
{Job 15:14} 人是什么，竟算为洁净呢？妇人所生的是什么，竟算为义呢？
{Job 15:15} Behold, God puts no trust in his holy ones, and the heavens are not pure in his sight;
{Job 15:15} 神不信靠他的众圣者；在他眼前，天也不洁净，
{Job 15:16} how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks injustice like water!
{Job 15:16} 何况那污秽可憎、喝罪孽如水的世人呢！
{Job 15:17} "I will show you; hear me, and what I have seen I will declare
{Job 15:17} 我指示你，你要听；我要述说所看见的，
{Job 15:18} (what wise men have told, without hiding it from their fathers,
{Job 15:18} 就是智慧人从列祖所受，传说而不隐瞒的。
{Job 15:19} to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them).

{Job 15:26} running stubbornly against him with a thickly bossed shield;
{Job 15:26} 挺着颈项，用盾牌的厚凸面向全能者直闯；
{Job 15:27} because he has covered his face with his fat and gathered fat upon his waist
{Job 15:27} 是因他的脸蒙上脂油，腰积成肥肉。
{Job 15:28} and has lived in desolate cities, in houses that none should inhabit, which were ready to become heaps of ruins;
{Job 15:28} 他曾住在荒凉城邑，无人居住、将成乱堆的房屋。
{Job 15:29} he will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the earth;
{Job 15:29} 他不得富足，财物不得常存，产业在地上也不加增。
{Job 15:30} he will not depart from darkness; the flame will dry up his shoots, and by the breath of his mouth he will depart.
{Job 15:30} 他不得出离黑暗。火焰要将他的枝子烧干；因神口中的气，他要灭亡（原文作走去）。
{Job 15:31} Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself, for emptiness will be his payment.

{Job 16:1}  约伯回答说：
{Job 16:2}  "I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all.
{Job 16:2}  这样的话我听了许多；你们安慰人，反叫人愁烦。
{Job 16:3}  Shall windy words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?
{Job 16:3}  虚空的言语有穷尽吗？有什么话惹动你回答呢？
{Job 16:4}  I also could speak as you do, if you were in my place; I could join words together against you and shake my head at you.
{Job 16:4}  我也能说你们那样的话；你们若处在我的境遇，我也会联络言语攻击你们，又能向你们摇头。
{Job 16:5}  I could strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain.
{Job 16:5}  但我必用口坚固你们，用嘴消解你们的忧愁。
{Job 16:6}  "If I speak, my pain is not assuaged, and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me?
{Job 16:6}  我虽说话，忧愁仍不得消解；我虽停住不说，忧愁就离开我吗？
{Job 16:7}  Surely now God has worn me out; he has made desolate all my company.
{Job 16:7}  但现在神使我困倦，使亲友远离我，
{Job 16:8}  And he has shriveled me up, which is a witness against me, and my leanness has risen up against me; it testifies to my face.
{Job 16:8}  又抓住我，作见证攻击我；我身体的枯瘦也当面见证我的不是。
{Job 16:9}  He has torn me in his wrath and hated me; he has gnashed his teeth at me; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me.
{Job 16:9}  主发怒撕裂我，逼迫我，向我切齿；我的敌人怒目看我。

{Job 16:10} 他们向我开口，打我的脸羞辱我，聚会攻击我。
{Job 16:11} God gives me up to the ungodly and casts me into the hands of the wicked.
{Job 16:11} 神把我交给不敬虔的人，把我扔到恶人的手中。
{Job 16:12} I was at ease, and he broke me apart; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target;
{Job 16:12} 我素来安逸，他折断我，掐住我的颈项，把我摔碎，又立我为他的箭靶子。
{Job 16:13} his archers surround me. He slashes open my kidneys and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.
{Job 16:13} 他的弓箭手四面围绕我；他破裂我的肺腑，并不留情，把我的胆倾倒在地上，

{Job 22:16} 他们未到死期，忽然除灭；根基毁坏，好像被江河冲去。
{Job 22:17} They said to God, 'Depart from us,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?'
{Job 22:17} 他们向神说：离开我们吧！又说：全能者能把我们怎么样呢？
{Job 22:18} Yet he filled their houses with good things-- but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
{Job 22:18} 哪知神以美物充满他们的房屋；但恶人所谋定的离我好远。
{Job 22:19} The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent one mocks at them,
{Job 22:19} 义人看见他们的结局就欢喜；无辜的人嗤笑他们，
{Job 22:20} saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left the fire has consumed.'
{Job 22:20} 说：那起来攻击我们的果然被剪除，其余的都被火烧灭。
{Job 22:21} "Agree with God, and be at peace; thereby good will come to you.
{Job 22:21} 你要认识神，就得平安；福气也必临到你。
{Job 22:22} Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.
{Job 22:22} 你当领受他口中的教训，将他的言语存在心里。
{Job 22:23} If you return to the Almighty you will be built up; if you remove injustice far from your tents,
{Job 22:23} 你若归向全能者，从你帐棚中远除不义，就必得建立。
{Job 22:24} if you lay gold in the dust, and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent-bed,
{Job 22:24} 要将你的珍宝丢在尘土里，将俄斐的黄金丢在溪河石头之间；
{Job 22:25} then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver.
{Job 22:25} 全能者就必为你的珍宝，作你的宝银。
{Job 22:26} For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.
{Job 22:26} 你就要以全能者为喜乐，向神仰起脸来。
{Job 22:27} You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows.
{Job 22:27} 你要祷告他，他就听你；你也要还你的愿。
{Job 22:28} You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways.
{Job 22:28} 你定意要做何事，必然给你成就；亮光也必照耀你的路。
{Job 22:29} For when they are humbled you say, 'It is because of pride'; but he saves the lowly.
{Job 22:29} 人使你降卑，你仍可说：必得高升；谦卑的人，神必然拯救。
{Job 22:30} He delivers even the one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."
{Job 22:30} 人非无辜，神且要搭救他；他因你手中清洁，必蒙拯救。
{Job 23:1}  Then Job answered and said:
{Job 23:1}  约伯回答说：
{Job 23:2}  "Today also my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy on account of my groaning.
{Job 23:2}  如今我的哀告还算为悖逆；我的责罚比我的唉哼还重。
{Job 23:3}  Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat!
{Job 23:3}  惟愿我能知道在那里可以寻见神，能到他的台前，
{Job 23:4}  I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
{Job 23:4}  我就在他面前将我的案件陈明，满口辩白。
{Job 23:5}  I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me.
{Job 23:5}  我必知道他回答我的言语，明白他向我所说的话。
{Job 23:6}  Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; he would pay attention to me.
{Job 23:6}  他岂用大能与我争辩吗？必不这样！他必理会我。
{Job 23:7}  There an upright man could argue with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge.
{Job 23:7}  在他那里正直人可以与他辩论；这样，我必永远脱离那审判我的。
{Job 23:8}  "Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I do not perceive him;
{Job 23:8}  只是，我往前行，他不在那里，往后退，也不能见他。
{Job 23:9}  on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him; he turns to the right hand, but I do not see him.
{Job 23:9}  他在左边行事，我却不能看见，在右边隐藏，我也不能见他。
{Job 23:10} But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come out as gold.
{Job 23:10} 然而他知道我所行的路；他试炼我之后，我必如精金。
{Job 23:11} My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside.
{Job 23:11} 我脚追随他的步履；我谨守他的道，并不偏离。
{Job 23:12} I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food.
{Job 23:12} 他嘴唇的命令，我未曾背弃；我看重他口中的言语，过于我需用的饮食。
{Job 23:13} But he is unchangeable, and who can turn him back? What he desires, that he does.
{Job 23:13} 只是他心志已定，谁能使他转意呢？他心里所愿的，就行出来。
{Job 23:14} For he will complete what he appoints for me, and many such things are in his mind.
{Job 23:14} 他向我所定的，就必做成；这类的事他还有许多。
{Job 23:15} Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him.
{Job 23:15} 所以我在他面前惊惶；我思念这事便惧怕他。
{Job 23:16} God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;
{Job 23:16} 神使我丧胆；全能者使我惊惶。
{Job 23:17} yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor because thick darkness covers my face.
{Job 23:17} 我的恐惧不是因为黑暗，也不是因为幽暗蒙蔽我的脸。
{Job 24:1}  "Why are not times of judgment kept by the Almighty, and why do those who know him never see his days?
{Job 24:1}  全能者既定期罚恶，为何不使认识他的人看见那日子呢？
{Job 24:2}  Some move landmarks; they seize flocks and pasture them.
{Job 24:2}  有人挪移地界，抢夺群畜而牧养。
{Job 24:3}  They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
{Job 24:3}  他们拉去孤儿的驴，强取寡妇的牛为当头。
{Job 24:4}  They thrust the poor off the road; the poor of the earth all hide themselves.
{Job 24:4}  他们使穷人离开正道；世上的贫民尽都隐藏。
{Job 24:5}  Behold, like wild donkeys in the desert the poor go out to their toil, seeking game; the wasteland yields food for their children.
{Job 24:5}  这些贫穷人如同野驴出到旷野，殷勤寻找食物；他们靠着野地给儿女糊口，
{Job 24:6}  They gather their fodder in the field, and they glean the vineyard of the wicked man.
{Job 24:6}  收割别人田间的禾稼，摘取恶人余剩的葡萄，
{Job 24:7}  They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.
{Job 24:7}  终夜赤身无衣，天气寒冷毫无遮盖，
{Job 24:8}  They are wet with the rain of the mountains and cling to the rock for lack of shelter.
{Job 24:8}  在山上被大雨淋湿，因没有避身之处就挨近磐石。
{Job 24:9}  (There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast, and they take a pledge against the poor.)
{Job 24:9}  又有人从母怀中抢夺孤儿，强取穷人的衣服为当头，
{Job 24:10} They go about naked, without clothing; hungry, they carry the sheaves;
{Job 24:10} 使人赤身无衣，到处流行，且因饥饿扛抬禾捆，
{Job 24:11} among the olive rows of the wicked they make oil; they tread the winepresses, but suffer thirst.
{Job 24:11} 在那些人的围墙内造油，榨酒，自己还口渴。
{Job 24:12} From out of the city the dying groan, and the soul of the wounded cries for help; yet God charges no one with wrong.
{Job 24:12} 在多民的城内有人唉哼，受伤的人哀号；神却不理会那恶人的愚妄。
{Job 24:13} "There are those who rebel against the light, who are not acquainted with its ways, and do not stay in its paths.
{Job 24:13} 又有人背弃光明，不认识光明的道，不住在光明的路上。
{Job 24:14} The murderer rises before it is light, that he may kill the poor and needy, and in the night he is like a thief.
{Job 24:14} 杀人的黎明起来，杀害困苦穷乏人，夜间又作盗贼。
{Job 24:15} The eye of the adulterer also waits for the twilight, saying, 'No eye will see me'; and he veils his face.
{Job 24:15} 奸夫等候黄昏，说：必无眼能见我，就把脸蒙蔽。
{Job 24:16} In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the light.
{Job 24:16} 盗贼黑夜挖窟窿；白日躲藏，并不认识光明。
{Job 24:17} For deep darkness is morning to all of them; for they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness.
{Job 24:17} 他们看早晨如幽暗，因为他们晓得幽暗的惊骇。
{Job 24:18} "You say, 'Swift are they on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the land; no treader turns toward their vineyards.
{Job 24:18} 这些恶人犹如浮萍快快飘去。他们所得的分在世上被咒诅；他们不得再走葡萄园的路。
{Job 24:19} Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters; so does Sheol those who have sinned.
{Job 24:19} 干旱炎热消没雪水；阴间也如此消没犯罪之辈。
{Job 24:20} The womb forgets them; the worm finds them sweet; they are no longer remembered, so wickedness is broken like a tree.'
{Job 24:20} 怀他的母（原文作胎）要忘记他；虫子要吃他，觉得甘甜；他不再被人记念。不义的人必如树折断。
{Job 24:21} "They wrong the barren, childless woman, and do no good to the widow.
{Job 24:21} 他恶待（或作：他吞灭）不怀孕不生养的妇人，不善待寡妇。
{Job 24:22} Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power; they rise up when they despair of life.
{Job 24:22} 然而神用能力保全有势力的人；那性命难保的人仍然兴起。
{Job 24:23} He gives them security, and they are supported, and his eyes are upon their ways.
{Job 24:23} 神使他们安稳，他们就有所倚靠；神的眼目也看顾他们的道路。
{Job 24:24} They are exalted a little while, and then are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like the heads of grain.
{Job 24:24} 他们被高举，不过片时就没有了；他们降为卑，被除灭，与众人一样，又如谷穗被割。
{Job 24:25} If it is not so, who will prove me a liar and show that there is nothing in what I say?"
{Job 24:25} 若不是这样，谁能证实我是说谎的，将我的言语驳为虚空呢？
{Job 25:1}  Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
{Job 25:1}  书亚人比勒达回答说：
{Job 25:2}  "Dominion and fear are with God; he makes peace in his high heaven.
{Job 25:2}  神有治理之权，有威严可畏；他在高处施行和平。
{Job 25:3}  Is there any number to his armies? Upon whom does his light not arise?
{Job 25:3}  他的诸军岂能数算？他的光亮一发，谁不蒙照呢？
{Job 25:4}  How then can man be in the right before God? How can he who is born of woman be pure?
{Job 25:4}  这样在神面前，人怎能称义？妇人所生的怎能洁净？
{Job 25:5}  Behold, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure in his eyes;
{Job 25:5}  在神眼前，月亮也无光亮，星宿也不清洁。
{Job 25:6}  how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!"
{Job 25:6}  何况如虫的人，如蛆的世人呢！
{Job 26:1}  Then Job answered and said:
{Job 26:1}  约伯回答说：
{Job 26:2}  "How you have helped him who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength!
{Job 26:2}  无能的人蒙你何等的帮助！膀臂无力的人蒙你何等的拯救！
{Job 26:3}  How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!
{Job 26:3}  无智慧的人蒙你何等的指教！你向他多显大知识！
{Job 26:4}  With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come out from you?
{Job 26:4}  你向谁发出言语来？谁的灵从你而出？
{Job 26:5}  The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants.
{Job 26:5}  在大水和水族以下的阴魂战兢。
{Job 26:6}  Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.
{Job 26:6}  在神面前，阴间显露；灭亡也不得遮掩。
{Job 26:7}  He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing.
{Job 26:7}  神将北极铺在空中，将大地悬在虚空；
{Job 26:8}  He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split open under them.
{Job 26:8}  将水包在密云中，云却不破裂；
{Job 26:9}  He covers the face of the full moon and spreads over it his cloud.
{Job 26:9}  遮蔽他的宝座，将云铺在其上；
{Job 26:10} He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
{Job 26:10} 在水面的周围划出界限，直到光明黑暗的交界。
{Job 26:11} The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke.
{Job 26:11} 天的柱子因他的斥责震动惊奇。
{Job 26:12} By his power he stilled the sea; by his understanding he shattered Rahab.
{Job 26:12} 他以能力搅动（或作：平静）大海；他藉知识打伤拉哈伯，
{Job 26:13} By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
{Job 26:13} 藉他的灵使天有妆饰；他的手刺杀快蛇。
{Job 26:14} Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"
{Job 26:14} 看哪，这不过是神工作的些微；我们所听于他的是何等细微的声音！他大能的雷声谁能明透呢？
{Job 27:1}  And Job again took up his discourse, and said:
{Job 27:1}  约伯接着说：
{Job 27:2}  "As God lives, who has taken away my right, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,
{Job 27:2}  神夺去我的理，全能者使我心中愁苦。我指着永生的神起誓：
{Job 27:3}  as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,
{Job 27:3}  我的生命尚在我里面；神所赐呼吸之气仍在我的鼻孔内。
{Job 27:4}  my lips will not speak falsehood, and my tongue will not utter deceit.
{Job 27:4}  我的嘴决不说非义之言；我的舌也不说诡诈之语。
{Job 27:5}  Far be it from me to say that you are right; till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
{Job 27:5}  我断不以你们为是；我至死必不以自己为不正！
{Job 27:6}  I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days.
{Job 27:6}  我持定我的义，必不放松；在世的日子，我心必不责备我。
{Job 27:7}  "Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.
{Job 27:7}  愿我的仇敌如恶人一样；愿那起来攻击我的，如不义之人一般。
{Job 27:8}  For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts him off, when God takes away his life?
{Job 27:8}  不敬虔的人虽然得利，神夺取其命的时候还有什么指望呢？
{Job 27:9}  Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?
{Job 27:9}  患难临到他，神岂能听他的呼求？
{Job 27:10} Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?
{Job 27:10} 他岂以全能者为乐，随时求告神呢？
{Job 27:11} I will teach you concerning the hand of God; what is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
{Job 27:11} 神的作为，我要指教你们；全能者所行的，我也不隐瞒。
{Job 27:12} Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?
{Job 27:12} 你们自己也都见过，为何全然变为虚妄呢？
{Job 27:13} "This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage that oppressors receive from the Almighty:
{Job 27:13} 神为恶人所定的分，强暴人从全能者所得的报（原文作产业）乃是这样：
{Job 27:14} If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword, and his descendants have not enough bread.
{Job 27:14} 倘或他的儿女增多，还是被刀所杀；他的子孙必不得饱食。
{Job 27:15} Those who survive him the pestilence buries, and his widows do not weep.
{Job 27:15} 他所遗留的人必死而埋葬；他的寡妇也不哀哭。
{Job 27:16} Though he heap up silver like dust, and pile up clothing like clay,
{Job 27:16} 他虽积蓄银子如尘沙，预备衣服如泥土；
{Job 27:17} he may pile it up, but the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver.
{Job 27:17} 他只管预备，义人却要穿上；他的银子，无辜的人要分取。
{Job 27:18} He builds his house like a moth's, like a booth that a watchman makes.
{Job 27:18} 他建造房屋如虫做窝，又如守望者所搭的棚。
{Job 27:19} He goes to bed rich, but will do so no more; he opens his eyes, and his wealth is gone.
{Job 27:19} 他虽富足躺卧，却不得收殓，转眼之间就不在了。
{Job 27:20} Terrors overtake him like a flood; in the night a whirlwind carries him off.
{Job 27:20} 惊恐如波涛将他追上；暴风在夜间将他刮去。
{Job 27:21} The east wind lifts him up and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.
{Job 27:21} 东风把他飘去，又刮他离开本处。
{Job 27:22} It hurls at him without pity; he flees from its power in headlong flight.
{Job 27:22} 神要向他射箭，并不留情；他恨不得逃脱神的手。
{Job 27:23} It claps its hands at him and hisses at him from its place.
{Job 27:23} 人要向他拍掌，并要发叱声，使他离开本处。
{Job 28:1}  "Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold that they refine.
{Job 28:1}  银子有矿；炼金有方。
{Job 28:2}  Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the ore.
{Job 28:2}  铁从地里挖出；铜从石中熔化。
{Job 28:3}  Man puts an end to darkness and searches out to the farthest limit the ore in gloom and deep darkness.
{Job 28:3}  人为黑暗定界限，查究幽暗阴翳的石头，直到极处，
{Job 28:4}  He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives; they are forgotten by travelers; they hang in the air, far away from mankind; they swing to and fro.
{Job 28:4}  在无人居住之处刨开矿穴，过路的人也想不到他们；又与人远离，悬在空中摇来摇去。
{Job 28:5}  As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath it is turned up as by fire.
{Job 28:5}  至于地，能出粮食，地内好像被火翻起来。
{Job 28:6}  Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold.
{Job 28:6}  地中的石头有蓝宝石，并有金沙。
{Job 28:7}  "That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it.
{Job 28:7}  矿中的路鸷鸟不得知道；鹰眼也未见过。
{Job 28:8}  The proud beasts have not trodden it; the lion has not passed over it.
{Job 28:8}  狂傲的野兽未曾行过；猛烈的狮子也未曾经过。
{Job 28:9}  "Man puts his hand to the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots.
{Job 28:9}  人伸手凿开坚石，倾倒山根，
{Job 28:10} He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing.
{Job 28:10} 在磐石中凿出水道，亲眼看见各样宝物。
{Job 28:11} He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, and the thing that is hidden he brings out to light.
{Job 28:11} 他封闭水不得滴流，使隐藏的物显露出来。
{Job 28:12} "But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
{Job 28:12} 然而，智慧有何处可寻？聪明之处在那里呢？
{Job 28:13} Man does not know its worth, and it is not found in the land of the living.
{Job 28:13} 智慧的价值无人能知，在活人之地也无处可寻。
{Job 28:14} The deep says, 'It is not in me,' and the sea says, 'It is not with me.'
{Job 28:14} 深渊说：不在我内；沧海说：不在我中。
{Job 28:15} It cannot be bought for gold, and silver cannot be weighed as its price.
{Job 28:15} 智慧非用黄金可得，也不能平白银为他的价值。
{Job 28:16} It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.
{Job 28:16} 俄斐金和贵重的红玛瑙，并蓝宝石，不足与较量；
{Job 28:17} Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
{Job 28:17} 黄金和玻璃不足与比较；精金的器皿不足与兑换。
{Job 28:18} No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; the price of wisdom is above pearls.
{Job 28:18} 珊瑚、水晶都不足论；智慧的价值胜过珍珠（或作：红宝石）。
{Job 28:19} The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.
{Job 28:19} 古实的红璧玺不足与比较；精金也不足与较量。
{Job 28:20} "From where, then, does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?
{Job 28:20} 智慧从何处来呢？聪明之处在那里呢？
{Job 28:21} It is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the air.
{Job 28:21} 是向一切有生命的眼目隐藏，向空中的飞鸟掩蔽。
{Job 28:22} Abaddon and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.'
{Job 28:22} 灭没和死亡说：我们风闻其名。
{Job 28:23} "God understands the way to it, and he knows its place.
{Job 28:23} 神明白智慧的道路，晓得智慧的所在。
{Job 28:24} For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
{Job 28:24} 因他鉴察直到地极，遍观普天之下，
{Job 28:25} When he gave to the wind its weight and apportioned the waters by measure,
{Job 28:25} 要为风定轻重，又度量诸水；
{Job 28:26} when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder,
{Job 28:26} 他为雨露定命令，为雷电定道路。
{Job 28:27} then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and searched it out.
{Job 28:27} 那时他看见智慧，而且述说；他坚定，并且查究。
{Job 28:28} And he said to man, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.'"
{Job 28:28} 他对人说：敬畏主就是智慧；远离恶便是聪明。
{Job 29:1}  And Job again took up his discourse, and said:
{Job 29:1}  约伯又接着说：
{Job 29:2}  "Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me,
{Job 29:2}  惟愿我的景况如从前的月份，如神保守我的日子。
{Job 29:3}  when his lamp shone upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness,
{Job 29:3}  那时他的灯照在我头上；我藉他的光行过黑暗。
{Job 29:4}  as I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent,
{Job 29:4}  我愿如壮年的时候：那时我在帐棚中，神待我有密友之情；
{Job 29:5}  when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were all around me,
{Job 29:5}  全能者仍与我同在；我的儿女都环绕我。
{Job 29:6}  when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
{Job 29:6}  奶多可洗我的脚；磐石为我出油成河。
{Job 29:7}  When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square,
{Job 29:7}  我出到城门，在街上设立座位；
{Job 29:8}  the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose and stood;
{Job 29:8}  少年人见我而回避，老年人也起身站立；
{Job 29:9}  the princes refrained from talking and laid their hand on their mouth;
{Job 29:9}  王子都停止说话，用手捂口；
{Job 29:10} the voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.
{Job 29:10} 首领静默无声，舌头贴住上膛。
{Job 29:11} When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved,

{Job 31:25} if I have rejoiced because my wealth was abundant or because my hand had found much,
{Job 31:25} 我若因财物丰裕，因我手多得资财而欢喜；
{Job 31:26} if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor,

{Job 31:27} and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand,

{Job 31:30} (I have not let my mouth sin by asking for his life with a curse),
{Job 31:30} （我没有容口犯罪，咒诅他的生命；）
{Job 31:31} if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who is there that has not been filled with his meat?'
{Job 31:31} 若我帐棚的人未尝说，谁不以主人的食物吃饱呢？
{Job 31:32} (the sojourner has not lodged in the street; I have opened my doors to the traveler),
{Job 31:32} （从来我没有容客旅在街上住宿，却开门迎接行路的人；）
{Job 31:33} if I have concealed my transgressions as others do by hiding my iniquity in my heart,
{Job 31:33} 我若像亚当（或作：别人）遮掩我的过犯，将罪孽藏在怀中；
{Job 31:34} because I stood in great fear of the multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors--
{Job 31:34} 因惧怕大众，又因宗族藐视我使我惊恐，以致闭口无言，杜门不出；
{Job 31:35} Oh, that I had one to hear me! (Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!) Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary!
{Job 31:35} 惟愿有一位肯听我！（看哪，在这里有我所划的押，愿全能者回答我！）
{Job 31:36} Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me as a crown;
{Job 31:36} 愿那敌我者所写的状词在我这里！我必带在肩上，又绑在头上为冠冕。

{Job 31:37} 我必向他述说我脚步的数目，必如君王进到他面前。
{Job 31:38} "If my land has cried out against me and its furrows have wept together,
{Job 31:38} 我若夺取田地，这地向我喊冤，犁沟一同哭泣；
{Job 31:39} if I have eaten its yield without payment and made its owners breathe their last,
{Job 31:39} 我若吃地的出产不给价值，或叫原主丧命；
{Job 31:40} let thorns grow instead of wheat, and foul weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
{Job 31:40} 愿这地长蒺藜代替麦子，长恶草代替大麦。约伯的话说完了。
{Job 32:1}  So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
{Job 32:1}  于是这三个人，因约伯自以为义就不再回答他。
{Job 32:2}  Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned with anger. He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself rather than God.
{Job 32:2}  那时有布西人兰族巴拉迦的儿子以利户向约伯发怒；因约伯自以为义，不以神为义。
{Job 32:3}  He burned with anger also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong.
{Job 32:3}  他又向约伯的三个朋友发怒；因为他们想不出回答的话来，仍以约伯为有罪。
{Job 32:4}  Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.
{Job 32:4}  以利户要与约伯说话，就等候他们，因为他们比自己年老。
{Job 32:5}  And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger.
{Job 32:5}  以利户见这三个人口中无话回答，就怒气发作。
{Job 32:6}  And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: "I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.
{Job 32:6}  布西人巴拉迦的儿子以利户回答说：我年轻，你们老迈；因此我退让，不敢向你们陈说我的意见。
{Job 32:7}  I said, 'Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.'
{Job 32:7}  我说，年老的当先说话；寿高的当以智慧教训人。
{Job 32:8}  But it is the spirit in man, the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand.
{Job 32:8}  但在人里面有灵；全能者的气使人有聪明。
{Job 32:9}  It is not the old who are wise, nor the aged who understand what is right.
{Job 32:9}  尊贵的不都有智慧；寿高的不都能明白公平。
{Job 32:10} Therefore I say, 'Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.'
{Job 32:10} 因此我说：你们要听我言；我也要陈说我的意见。
{Job 32:11} "Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say.
{Job 32:11} 你们查究所要说的话；那时我等候你们的话，侧耳听你们的辩论，
{Job 32:12} I gave you my attention, and, behold, there was none among you who refuted Job or who answered his words.
{Job 32:12} 留心听你们；谁知你们中间无一人折服约伯，驳倒他的话。
{Job 32:13} Beware lest you say, 'We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a man.'
{Job 32:13} 你们切不可说：我们寻得智慧；神能胜他，人却不能。
{Job 32:14} He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches.
{Job 32:14} 约伯没有向我争辩；我也不用你们的话回答他。
{Job 32:15} "They are dismayed; they answer no more; they have not a word to say.
{Job 32:15} 他们惊奇不再回答，一言不发。
{Job 32:16} And shall I wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more?
{Job 32:16} 我岂因他们不说话，站住不再回答，仍旧等候呢？
{Job 32:17} I also will answer with my share; I also will declare my opinion.
{Job 32:17} 我也要回答我的一分话，陈说我的意见。
{Job 32:18} For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.
{Job 32:18} 因为我的言语满怀；我里面的灵激动我。
{Job 32:19} Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins ready to burst.
{Job 32:19} 我的胸怀如盛酒之囊没有出气之缝，又如新皮袋快要破裂。
{Job 32:20} I must speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.
{Job 32:20} 我要说话，使我舒畅；我要开口回答。
{Job 32:21} I will not show partiality to any man or use flattery toward any person.
{Job 32:21} 我必不看人的情面，也不奉承人。
{Job 32:22} For I do not know how to flatter, else my Maker would soon take me away.
{Job 32:22} 我不晓得奉承；若奉承，造我的主必快快除灭我。
{Job 33:1}  "But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words.
{Job 33:1}  约伯啊，请听我的话，留心听我一切的言语。
{Job 33:2}  Behold, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks.
{Job 33:2}  我现在开口，用舌发言。
{Job 33:3}  My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely.

{Job 33:10} Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy,
{Job 33:10} 神找机会攻击我，以我为仇敌，
{Job 33:11} he puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths.'
{Job 33:11} 把我的脚上了木狗，窥察我一切的道路。
{Job 33:12} "Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.
{Job 33:12} 我要回答你说：你这话无理，因神比世人更大。
{Job 33:13} Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of man's words'?
{Job 33:13} 你为何与他争论呢？因他的事都不对人解说？
{Job 33:14} For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it.
{Job 33:14} 神说一次、两次，世人却不理会。
{Job 33:15} In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds,
{Job 33:15} 人躺在床上沉睡的时候，神就用梦和夜间的异象，
{Job 33:16} then he opens the ears of men and terrifies them with warnings,
{Job 33:16} 开通他们的耳朵，将当受的教训印在他们心上，
{Job 33:17} that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man;
{Job 33:17} 好叫人不从自己的谋算，不行骄傲的事（原文作将骄傲向人隐藏），
{Job 33:18} he keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.
{Job 33:18} 拦阻人不陷于坑里，不死在刀下。
{Job 33:19} "Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones,

{Job 33:27} 他在人前歌唱说：我犯了罪，颠倒是非，这竟与我无益。
{Job 33:28} He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.'
{Job 33:28} 神救赎我的灵魂免入深坑；我的生命也必见光。
{Job 33:29} "Behold, God does all these things, twice, three times, with a man,
{Job 33:29} 神两次、三次向人行这一切的事，
{Job 33:30} to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be lighted with the light of life.
{Job 33:30} 为要从深坑救回人的灵魂，使他被光照耀，与活人一样。
{Job 33:31} Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
{Job 33:31} 约伯啊，你当侧耳听我的话，不要作声，等我讲说。
{Job 33:32} If you have any words, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.
{Job 33:32} 你若有话说，就可以回答我；你只管说，因我愿以你为是。
{Job 33:33} If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
{Job 33:33} 若不然，你就听我说；你不要作声，我便将智慧教训你。
{Job 34:1}  Then Elihu answered and said:
{Job 34:1}  以利户又说：
{Job 34:2}  "Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who know;
{Job 34:2}  你们智慧人要听我的话；有知识的人要留心听我说。
{Job 34:3}  for the ear tests words as the palate tastes food.
{Job 34:3}  因为耳朵试验话语，好像上膛尝食物。
{Job 34:4}  Let us choose what is right; let us know among ourselves what is good.
{Job 34:4}  我们当选择何为是，彼此知道何为善。
{Job 34:5}  For Job has said, 'I am in the right, and God has taken away my right;
{Job 34:5}  约伯曾说：我是公义，神夺去我的理；
{Job 34:6}  in spite of my right I am counted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.'
{Job 34:6}  我虽有理，还算为说谎言的；我虽无过，受的伤还不能医治。
{Job 34:7}  What man is like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water,
{Job 34:7}  谁像约伯，喝讥诮如同喝水呢？
{Job 34:8}  who travels in company with evildoers and walks with wicked men?
{Job 34:8}  他与作孽的结伴，和恶人同行。
{Job 34:9}  For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing that he should take delight in God.'
{Job 34:9}  他说：人以神为乐，总是无益。
{Job 34:10} "Therefore, hear me, you men of understanding: far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong.
{Job 34:10} 所以，你们明理的人要听我的话。神断不至行恶；全能者断不至作孽。
{Job 34:11} For according to the work of a man he will repay him, and according to his ways he will make it befall him.
{Job 34:11} 他必按人所做的报应人，使各人照所行的得报。
{Job 34:12} Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice.
{Job 34:12} 神必不作恶；全能者也不偏离公平。
{Job 34:13} Who gave him charge over the earth, and who laid on him the whole world?
{Job 34:13} 谁派他治理地，安定全世界呢？
{Job 34:14} If he should set his heart to it and gather to himself his spirit and his breath,
{Job 34:14} 他若专心为己，将灵和气收归自己，
{Job 34:15} all flesh would perish together, and man would return to dust.
{Job 34:15} 凡有血气的就必一同死亡；世人必仍归尘土。
{Job 34:16} "If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.
{Job 34:16} 你若明理，就当听我的话，留心听我言语的声音。
{Job 34:17} Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,
{Job 34:17} 难道恨恶公平的可以掌权吗？那有公义的、有大能的，岂可定他有罪吗？
{Job 34:18} who says to a king, 'Worthless one,' and to nobles, 'Wicked man,'
{Job 34:18} 他对君王说：你是鄙陋的；对贵臣说：你是邪恶的。
{Job 34:19} who shows no partiality to princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?
{Job 34:19} 他待王子不徇情面，也不看重富足的过于贫穷的，因为都是他手所造。
{Job 34:20} In a moment they die; at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no human hand.
{Job 34:20} 在转眼之间，半夜之中，他们就死亡。百姓被震动而去世；有权力的被夺去非借人手。
{Job 34:21} "For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps.
{Job 34:21} 神注目观看人的道路，看明人的脚步。
{Job 34:22} There is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers may hide themselves.
{Job 34:22} 没有黑暗、阴翳能给作孽的藏身。
{Job 34:23} For God has no need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment.
{Job 34:23} 神审判人，不必使人到他面前再三鉴察。
{Job 34:24} He shatters the mighty without investigation and sets others in their place.
{Job 34:24} 他用难测之法打破有能力的人，设立别人代替他们。
{Job 34:25} Thus, knowing their works, he overturns them in the night, and they are crushed.
{Job 34:25} 他原知道他们的行为，使他们在夜间倾倒灭亡。
{Job 34:26} He strikes them for their wickedness in a place for all to see,
{Job 34:26} 他在众人眼前击打他们，如同击打恶人一样。
{Job 34:27} because they turned aside from following him and had no regard for any of his ways,
{Job 34:27} 因为他们偏行不跟从他，也不留心他的道，
{Job 34:28} so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted--
{Job 34:28} 甚至使贫穷人的哀声达到他那里；他也听了困苦人的哀声。
{Job 34:29} When he is quiet, who can condemn? When he hides his face, who can behold him, whether it be a nation or a man?--
{Job 34:29} 他使人安静，谁能扰乱（或作：定罪）呢？他掩面，谁能见他呢？无论待一国或一人都是如此
{Job 34:30} that a godless man should not reign, that he should not ensnare the people.
{Job 34:30} 使不虔敬的人不得作王，免得有人牢笼百姓。
{Job 34:31} "For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne punishment; I will not offend any more;
{Job 34:31} 有谁对神说：我受了责罚，不再犯罪；
{Job 34:32} teach me what I do not see; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'?
{Job 34:32} 我所看不明的，求你指教我；我若作了孽，必不再作？
{Job 34:33} Will he then make repayment to suit you, because you reject it? For you must choose, and not I; therefore declare what you know.
{Job 34:33} 他施行报应，岂要随你的心愿、叫你推辞不受吗？选定的是你，不是我。你所知道的只管说吧！
{Job 34:34} Men of understanding will say to me, and the wise man who hears me will say:
{Job 34:34} 明理的人和听我话的智慧人必对我说：
{Job 34:35} 'Job speaks without knowledge; his words are without insight.'
{Job 34:35} 约伯说话没有知识，言语中毫无智慧。
{Job 34:36} Would that Job were tried to the end, because he answers like wicked men.
{Job 34:36} 愿约伯被试验到底，因他回答像恶人一样。
{Job 34:37} For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."
{Job 34:37} 他在罪上又加悖逆；在我们中间拍手，用许多言语轻慢神。
{Job 35:1}  And Elihu answered and said:
{Job 35:1}  以利户又说：
{Job 35:2}  "Do you think this to be just? Do you say, 'It is my right before God,'
{Job 35:2}  你以为有理，或以为你的公义胜于神的公义，
{Job 35:3}  that you ask, 'What advantage have I? How am I better off than if I had sinned?'
{Job 35:3}  才说这与我有什么益处？我不犯罪比犯罪有什么好处呢？
{Job 35:4}  I will answer you and your friends with you.
{Job 35:4}  我要回答你和在你这里的朋友。
{Job 35:5}  Look at the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds, which are higher than you.
{Job 35:5}  你要向天观看，瞻望那高于你的穹苍。
{Job 35:6}  If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
{Job 35:6}  你若犯罪，能使神受何害呢？你的过犯加增，能使神受何损呢？
{Job 35:7}  If you are righteous, what do you give to him? Or what does he receive from your hand?
{Job 35:7}  你若是公义，还能加增他什么呢？他从你手里还接受什么呢？
{Job 35:8}  Your wickedness concerns a man like yourself, and your righteousness a son of man.
{Job 35:8}  你的过恶或能害你这类的人；你的公义或能叫世人得益处。
{Job 35:9}  "Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out; they call for help because of the arm of the mighty.
{Job 35:9}  人因多受欺压就哀求，因受能者的辖制（原文作膀臂）便求救，
{Job 35:10} But none says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
{Job 35:10} 却无人说：造我的神在那里？他使人夜间歌唱，
{Job 35:11} who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?'
{Job 35:11} 教训我们胜于地上的走兽，使我们有聪明胜于空中的飞鸟。
{Job 35:12} There they cry out, but he does not answer, because of the pride of evil men.
{Job 35:12} 他们在那里，因恶人的骄傲呼求，却无人答应。
{Job 35:13} Surely God does not hear an empty cry, nor does the Almighty regard it.
{Job 35:13} 虚妄的呼求，神必不垂听；全能者也必不眷顾。
{Job 35:14} How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him!
{Job 35:14} 何况你说，你不得见他；你的案件在他面前，你等候他吧。
{Job 35:15} And now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not take much note of transgression,
{Job 35:15} 但如今因他未曾发怒降罚，也不甚理会狂傲，
{Job 35:16} Job opens his mouth in empty talk; he multiplies words without knowledge."
{Job 35:16} 所以约伯开口说虚妄的话，多发无知识的言语。
{Job 36:1}  And Elihu continued, and said:
{Job 36:1}  以利户又接着说：
{Job 36:2}  "Bear with me a little, and I will show you, for I have yet something to say on God's behalf.
{Job 36:2}  你再容我片时，我就指示你，因我还有话为神说。
{Job 36:3}  I will get my knowledge from afar and ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
{Job 36:3}  我要将所知道的从远处引来，将公义归给造我的主。
{Job 36:4}  For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
{Job 36:4}  我的言语真不虚谎；有知识全备的与你同在。
{Job 36:5}  "Behold, God is mighty, and does not despise any; he is mighty in strength of understanding.
{Job 36:5}  神有大能，并不藐视人；他的智慧甚广。
{Job 36:6}  He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives the afflicted their right.
{Job 36:6}  他不保护恶人的性命，却为困苦人伸冤。
{Job 36:7}  He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne he sets them forever, and they are exalted.
{Job 36:7}  他时常看顾义人，使他们和君王同坐宝座，永远要被高举。
{Job 36:8}  And if they are bound in chains and caught in the cords of affliction,
{Job 36:8}  他们若被锁链捆住，被苦难的绳索缠住，
{Job 36:9}  then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly.
{Job 36:9}  他就把他们的作为和过犯指示他们，叫他们知道有骄傲的行动。
{Job 36:10} He opens their ears to instruction and commands that they return from iniquity.
{Job 36:10} 他也开通他们的耳朵得受教训，吩咐他们离开罪孽转回。
{Job 36:11} If they listen and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasantness.
{Job 36:11} 他们若听从事奉他，就必度日亨通，历年福乐；
{Job 36:12} But if they do not listen, they perish by the sword and die without knowledge.
{Job 36:12} 若不听从，就要被刀杀灭，无知无识而死。
{Job 36:13} "The godless in heart cherish anger; they do not cry for help when he binds them.
{Job 36:13} 那心中不敬虔的人积蓄怒气；神捆绑他们，他们竟不求救；
{Job 36:14} They die in youth, and their life ends among the cult prostitutes.
{Job 36:14} 必在青年时死亡，与污秽人一样丧命。
{Job 36:15} He delivers the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ear by adversity.
{Job 36:15} 神藉着困苦救拔困苦人，趁他们受欺压开通他们的耳朵。
{Job 36:16} He also allured you out of distress into a broad place where there was no cramping, and what was set on your table was full of fatness.
{Job 36:16} 神也必引你出离患难，进入宽阔不狭窄之地；摆在你席上的必满有肥甘。
{Job 36:17} "But you are full of the judgment on the wicked; judgment and justice seize you.
{Job 36:17} 但你满口有恶人批评的言语；判断和刑罚抓住你。
{Job 36:18} Beware lest wrath entice you into scoffing, and let not the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
{Job 36:18} 不可容忿怒触动你，使你不服责罚；也不可因赎价大就偏行。
{Job 36:19} Will your cry for help avail to keep you from distress, or all the force of your strength?
{Job 36:19} 你的呼求（或作：资财），或是你一切的势力，果有灵验，叫你不受患难吗？
{Job 36:20} Do not long for the night, when peoples vanish in their place.
{Job 36:20} 不要切慕黑夜，就是众民在本处被除灭的时候。
{Job 36:21} Take care; do not turn to iniquity, for this you have chosen rather than affliction.
{Job 36:21} 你要谨慎，不可重看罪孽，因你选择罪孽过于选择苦难。
{Job 36:22} Behold, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him?
{Job 36:22} 神行事有高大的能力；教训人的有谁像他呢？
{Job 36:23} Who has prescribed for him his way, or who can say, 'You have done wrong'?
{Job 36:23} 谁派定他的道路？谁能说：你所行的不义？
{Job 36:24} "Remember to extol his work, of which men have sung.
{Job 36:24} 你不可忘记称赞他所行的为大，就是人所歌颂的。
{Job 36:25} All mankind has looked on it; man beholds it from afar.
{Job 36:25} 他所行的，万人都看见；世人也从远处观看。
{Job 36:26} Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable.
{Job 36:26} 神为大，我们不能全知；他的年数不能测度。
{Job 36:27} For he draws up the drops of water; they distill his mist in rain,
{Job 36:27} 他吸取水点，这水点从云雾中就变成雨；
{Job 36:28} which the skies pour down and drop on mankind abundantly.
{Job 36:28} 云彩将雨落下，沛然降与世人。
{Job 36:29} Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?
{Job 36:29} 谁能明白云彩如何铺张，和神行宫的雷声呢？
{Job 36:30} Behold, he scatters his lightning about him and covers the roots of the sea.
{Job 36:30} 他将亮光普照在自己的四围；他又遮覆海底。
{Job 36:31} For by these he judges peoples; he gives food in abundance.
{Job 36:31} 他用这些审判众民，且赐丰富的粮食。
{Job 36:32} He covers his hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark.
{Job 36:32} 他以电光遮手，命闪电击中敌人（或作：中了靶子）。
{Job 36:33} Its crashing declares his presence; the cattle also declare that he rises.
{Job 36:33} 所发的雷声显明他的作为，又向牲畜指明要起暴风。
{Job 37:1}  "At this also my heart trembles and leaps out of its place.
{Job 37:1}  因此我心战兢，从原处移动。
{Job 37:2}  Keep listening to the thunder of his voice and the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
{Job 37:2}  听啊，神轰轰的声音是他口中所发的响声。
{Job 37:3}  Under the whole heaven he lets it go, and his lightning to the corners of the earth.
{Job 37:3}  他发响声震遍天下，发电光闪到地极。
{Job 37:4}  After it his voice roars; he thunders with his majestic voice, and he does not restrain the lightnings when his voice is heard.
{Job 37:4}  随后人听见有雷声轰轰，大发威严，雷电接连不断。
{Job 37:5}  God thunders wondrously with his voice; he does great things that we cannot comprehend.
{Job 37:5}  神发出奇妙的雷声；他行大事，我们不能测透。
{Job 37:6}  For to the snow he says, 'Fall on the earth,' likewise to the downpour, his mighty downpour.
{Job 37:6}  他对雪说：要降在地上；对大雨和暴雨也是这样说。
{Job 37:7}  He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he made may know it.
{Job 37:7}  他封住各人的手，叫所造的万人都晓得他的作为。
{Job 37:8}  Then the beasts go into their lairs, and remain in their dens.
{Job 37:8}  百兽进入穴中，卧在洞内。
{Job 37:9}  From its chamber comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds.
{Job 37:9}  暴风出于南宫；寒冷出于北方。
{Job 37:10} By the breath of God ice is given, and the broad waters are frozen fast.
{Job 37:10} 神嘘气成冰；宽阔之水也都凝结。
{Job 37:11} He loads the thick cloud with moisture; the clouds scatter his lightning.
{Job 37:11} 他使密云盛满水气，布散电光之云；
{Job 37:12} They turn around and around by his guidance, to accomplish all that he commands them on the face of the habitable world.
{Job 37:12} 这云是藉他的指引游行旋转，得以在全地面上行他一切所吩咐的，
{Job 37:13} Whether for correction or for his land or for love, he causes it to happen.
{Job 37:13} 或为责罚，或为润地，或为施行慈爱。
{Job 37:14} "Hear this, O Job; stop and consider the wondrous works of God.
{Job 37:14} 约伯啊，你要留心听，要站立思想神奇妙的作为。
{Job 37:15} Do you know how God lays his command upon them and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?
{Job 37:15} 神如何吩咐这些，如何使云中的电光照耀，你知道吗？
{Job 37:16} Do you know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge,
{Job 37:16} 云彩如何浮于空中，那知识全备者奇妙的作为，你知道吗？
{Job 37:17} you whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind?
{Job 37:17} 南风使地寂静，你的衣服就如火热，你知道吗？
{Job 37:18} Can you, like him, spread out the skies, hard as a cast metal mirror?
{Job 37:18} 你岂能与神同铺穹苍吗？这穹苍坚硬，如同铸成的镜子。
{Job 37:19} Teach us what we shall say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of darkness.
{Job 37:19} 我们愚昧不能陈说；请你指教我们该对他说什么话。
{Job 37:20} Shall it be told him that I would speak? Did a man ever wish that he would be swallowed up?
{Job 37:20} 人岂可说：我愿与他说话？岂有人自愿灭亡吗？
{Job 37:21} "And now no one looks on the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and cleared them.
{Job 37:21} 现在有云遮蔽，人不得见穹苍的光亮；但风吹过，天又发晴。
{Job 37:22} Out of the north comes golden splendor; God is clothed with awesome majesty.
{Job 37:22} 金光出于北方，在神那里有可怕的威严。
{Job 37:23} The Almighty--we cannot find him; he is great in power; justice and abundant righteousness he will not violate.
{Job 37:23} 论到全能者，我们不能测度；他大有能力，有公平和大义，必不苦待人。
{Job 37:24} Therefore men fear him; he does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit."
{Job 37:24} 所以，人敬畏他；凡自以为心中有智慧的人，他都不顾念。
{Job 38:1}  Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
{Job 38:1}  那时，耶和华从旋风中回答约伯说：
{Job 38:2}  "Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
{Job 38:2}  谁用无知的言语使我的旨意暗昧不明？
{Job 38:3}  Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me.
{Job 38:3}  你要如勇士束腰；我问你，你可以指示我。
{Job 38:4}  "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.
{Job 38:4}  我立大地根基的时候，你在那里呢？你若有聪明，只管说吧！
{Job 38:5}  Who determined its measurements--surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?
{Job 38:5}  你若晓得就说，是谁定地的尺度？是谁把准绳拉在其上？
{Job 38:6}  On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone,
{Job 38:6}  地的根基安置在何处？地的角石是谁安放的？
{Job 38:7}  when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
{Job 38:7}  那时，晨星一同歌唱；神的众子也都欢呼。
{Job 38:8}  "Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb,
{Job 38:8}  海水冲出，如出胎胞，那时谁将他关闭呢？
{Job 38:9}  when I made clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band,
{Job 38:9}  是我用云彩当海的衣服，用幽暗当包裹他的布，
{Job 38:10} and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors,
{Job 38:10} 为他定界限，又安门和闩，
{Job 38:11} and said, 'Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed'?
{Job 38:11} 说：你只可到这里，不可越过；你狂傲的浪要到此止住。
{Job 38:12} "Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,
{Job 38:12} 你自生以来，曾命定晨光，使清晨的日光知道本位，
{Job 38:13} that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?
{Job 38:13} 叫这光普照地的四极，将恶人从其中驱逐出来吗？
{Job 38:14} It is changed like clay under the seal, and its features stand out like a garment.
{Job 38:14} 因这光，地面改变如泥上印印，万物出现如衣服一样。
{Job 38:15} From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken.
{Job 38:15} 亮光不照恶人；强横的膀臂也必折断。
{Job 38:16} "Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep?
{Job 38:16} 你曾进到海源，或在深渊的隐密处行走吗？
{Job 38:17} Have the gates of death been revealed to you, or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
{Job 38:17} 死亡的门曾向你显露吗？死荫的门你曾见过吗？
{Job 38:18} Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth? Declare, if you know all this.
{Job 38:18} 地的广大你能明透吗？你若全知道，只管说吧！
{Job 38:19} "Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and where is the place of darkness,
{Job 38:19} 光明的居所从何而至？黑暗的本位在于何处？
{Job 38:20} that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home?
{Job 38:20} 你能带到本境，能看明其室之路吗？
{Job 38:21} You know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!
{Job 38:21} 你总知道，因为你早已生在世上，你日子的数目也多。
{Job 38:22} "Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
{Job 38:22} 你曾进入雪库，或见过雹仓吗？
{Job 38:23} which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?
{Job 38:23} 这雪雹乃是我为降灾，并打仗和争战的日子所预备的。

{Job 42:2}  我知道，你万事都能做；你的旨意不能拦阻。
{Job 42:3}  'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.

And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."
{Job 42:8}  现在你们要取七只公牛，七只公羊，到我仆人约伯那里去，为自己献上燔祭，我的仆人约伯就为你们祈祷。我因悦纳他，就不按你们的愚妄办你们。你们议论我，不如我的仆人约伯说的是。”

{Job 42:11} 约伯的弟兄、姊妹，和以先所认识的人都来见他，在他家里一同吃饭；又论到耶和华所降与他的一切灾祸，都为他悲伤安慰他。每人也送他一块银子和一个金环。
