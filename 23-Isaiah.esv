{Isa 1:1}   The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
{Isa 1:1}   当乌西雅、约坦、亚哈斯、希西家作犹大王的时候，亚摩斯的儿子以赛亚得默示，论到犹大和耶路撒冷。
{Isa 1:2}   Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the LORD has spoken: "Children have I reared and brought up, but they have rebelled against me.
{Isa 1:2}   天哪，要听！地啊，侧耳而听！因为耶和华说：我养育儿女，将他们养大，他们竟悖逆我。
{Isa 1:3}   The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."
{Isa 1:3}   牛认识主人，驴认识主人的槽，以色列却不认识；我的民却不留意。
{Isa 1:4}   Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are utterly estranged.
{Isa 1:4}   嗐！犯罪的国民，担着罪孽的百姓；行恶的种类，败坏的儿女！他们离弃耶和华，藐视以色列的圣者，与他生疏，往后退步。
{Isa 1:5}   Why will you still be struck down? Why will you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
{Isa 1:5}   你们为什么屡次悖逆，还要受责打吗？你们已经满头疼痛，全心发昏。
{Isa 1:6}   From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and raw wounds; they are not pressed out or bound up or softened with oil.
{Isa 1:6}   从脚掌到头顶，没有一处完全的，尽是伤口、青肿，与新打的伤痕，都没有收口，没有缠裹，也没有用膏滋润。
{Isa 1:7}   Your country lies desolate; your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence foreigners devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.
{Isa 1:7}   你们的地土已经荒凉；你们的城邑被火焚毁。你们的田地在你们眼前为外邦人所侵吞，既被外邦人倾覆就成为荒凉。
{Isa 1:8}   And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a lodge in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.
{Isa 1:8}   仅存锡安城（原文作女子），好像葡萄园的草棚，瓜田的茅屋，被围困的城邑。
{Isa 1:9}   If the LORD of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we should have been like Sodom, and become like Gomorrah.
{Isa 1:9}   若不是万军之耶和华给我们稍留余种，我们早已像所多玛、蛾摩拉的样子了。
{Isa 1:10}  Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom! Give ear to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
{Isa 1:10}  你们这所多玛的官长啊，要听耶和华的话！你们这蛾摩拉的百姓啊，要侧耳听我们神的训诲！
{Isa 1:11}  "What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.
{Isa 1:11}  耶和华说：你们所献的许多祭物与我何益呢？公绵羊的燔祭和肥畜的脂油，我已经够了；公牛的血，羊羔的血，公山羊的血，我都不喜悦。
{Isa 1:12}  "When you come to appear before me, who has required of you this trampling of my courts?
{Isa 1:12}  你们来朝见我，谁向你们讨这些，使你们践踏我的院宇呢？
{Isa 1:13}  Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations-- I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.
{Isa 1:13}  你们不要再献虚浮的供物。香品是我所憎恶的；月朔和安息日，并宣召的大会，也是我所憎恶的；作罪孽，又守严肃会，我也不能容忍。
{Isa 1:14}  Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates; they have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.
{Isa 1:14}  你们的月朔和节期，我心里恨恶，我都以为麻烦；我担当，便不耐烦。
{Isa 1:15}  When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.
{Isa 1:15}  你们举手祷告，我必遮眼不看；就是你们多多的祈祷，我也不听。你们的手都满了杀人的血。
{Isa 1:16}  Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil,
{Isa 1:16}  你们要洗濯、自洁，从我眼前除掉你们的恶行，要止住作恶，
{Isa 1:17}  learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause.
{Isa 1:17}  学习行善，寻求公平，解救受欺压的；给孤儿伸冤，为寡妇辨屈。
{Isa 1:18}  "Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
{Isa 1:18}  耶和华说：你们来，我们彼此辩论。你们的罪虽像朱红，必变成雪白；虽红如丹颜，必白如羊毛。
{Isa 1:19}  If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;
{Isa 1:19}  你们若甘心听从，必吃地上的美物，
{Isa 1:20}  but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be eaten by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
{Isa 1:20}  若不听从，反倒悖逆，必被刀剑吞灭。这是耶和华亲口说的。
{Isa 1:21}  How the faithful city has become a whore, she who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
{Isa 1:21}  可叹，忠信的城变为妓女！从前充满了公平，公义居在其中，现今却有凶手居住。
{Isa 1:22}  Your silver has become dross, your best wine mixed with water.
{Isa 1:22}  你的银子变为渣滓；你的酒用水搀对。
{Isa 1:23}  Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not bring justice to the fatherless, and the widow's cause does not come to them.
{Isa 1:23}  你的官长居心悖逆，与盗贼作伴，各都喜爱贿赂，追求赃私。他们不为孤儿伸冤；寡妇的案件也不得呈到他们面前。
{Isa 1:24}  Therefore the Lord declares, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: "Ah, I will get relief from my enemies and avenge myself on my foes.
{Isa 1:24}  因此，主万军之耶和华、以色列的大能者说：哎！我要向我的对头雪恨，向我的敌人报仇。
{Isa 1:25}  I will turn my hand against you and will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.
{Isa 1:25}  我必反手加在你身上，炼尽你的渣滓，除净你的杂质。
{Isa 1:26}  And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city."
{Isa 1:26}  我也必复还你的审判官，像起初一样，复还你的谋士，像起先一般。然后，你必称为公义之城，忠信之邑。
{Isa 1:27}  Zion shall be redeemed by justice, and those in her who repent, by righteousness.
{Isa 1:27}  锡安必因公平得蒙救赎；其中归正的人必因公义得蒙救赎。
{Isa 1:28}  But rebels and sinners shall be broken together, and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
{Isa 1:28}  但悖逆的和犯罪的必一同败亡；离弃耶和华的必致消灭。
{Isa 1:29}  For they shall be ashamed of the oaks that you desired; and you shall blush for the gardens that you have chosen.
{Isa 1:29}  那等人必因你们所喜爱的橡树抱愧；你们必因所选择的园子蒙羞。
{Isa 1:30}  For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers, and like a garden without water.
{Isa 1:30}  因为，你们必如叶子枯干的橡树，好像无水浇灌的园子。
{Isa 1:31}  And the strong shall become tinder, and his work a spark, and both of them shall burn together, with none to quench them.
{Isa 1:31}  有权势的必如麻瓤；他的工作好像火星，都要一同焚毁，无人扑灭。
{Isa 2:1}   The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
{Isa 2:1}   亚摩斯的儿子以赛亚得默示，论到犹大和耶路撒冷。
{Isa 2:2}   It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it,
{Isa 2:2}   末后的日子，耶和华殿的山必坚立，超乎诸山，高举过于万岭；万民都要流归这山。
{Isa 2:3}   and many peoples shall come, and say: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
{Isa 2:3}   必有许多国的民前往，说：来吧，我们登耶和华的山，奔雅各神的殿。主必将他的道教训我们；我们也要行他的路。因为训诲必出于锡安；耶和华的言语必出于耶路撒冷。
{Isa 2:4}   He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide disputes for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.
{Isa 2:4}   他必在列国中施行审判，为许多国民断定是非。他们要将刀打成犁头，把枪打成镰刀。这国不举刀攻击那国；他们也不再学习战事。
{Isa 2:5}   O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD.
{Isa 2:5}   雅各家啊，来吧！我们在耶和华的光明中行走。
{Isa 2:6}   For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of things from the east and of fortune-tellers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
{Isa 2:6}   耶和华，你离弃了你百姓雅各家，是因他们充满了东方的风俗，作观兆的，像非利士人一样，并与外邦人击掌。
{Isa 2:7}   Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.
{Isa 2:7}   他们的国满了金银，财宝也无穷；他们的地满了马匹，车辆也无数。
{Isa 2:8}   Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made.
{Isa 2:8}   他们的地满了偶像；他们跪拜自己手所造的，就是自己指头所做的。
{Isa 2:9}   So man is humbled, and each one is brought low-- do not forgive them!
{Isa 2:9}   卑贱人屈膝；尊贵人下跪；所以不可饶恕他们。
{Isa 2:10}  Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from before the terror of the LORD, and from the splendor of his majesty.
{Isa 2:10}  你当进入岩穴，藏在土中，躲避耶和华的惊吓和他威严的荣光。
{Isa 2:11}  The haughty looks of man shall be brought low, and the lofty pride of men shall be humbled, and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
{Isa 2:11}  到那日，眼目高傲的必降为卑；性情狂傲的都必屈膝；惟独耶和华被尊崇。
{Isa 2:12}  For the LORD of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up--and it shall be brought low;
{Isa 2:12}  必有万军耶和华降罚的一个日子，要临到骄傲狂妄的；一切自高的都必降为卑；
{Isa 2:13}  against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan;
{Isa 2:13}  又临到利巴嫩高大的香柏树和巴珊的橡树；
{Isa 2:14}  against all the lofty mountains, and against all the uplifted hills;
{Isa 2:14}  又临到一切高山的峻岭；
{Isa 2:15}  against every high tower, and against every fortified wall;
{Isa 2:15}  又临到高台和坚固城墙；
{Isa 2:16}  against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.
{Isa 2:16}  又临到他施的船只并一切可爱的美物。
{Isa 2:17}  And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled, and the lofty pride of men shall be brought low, and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
{Isa 2:17}  骄傲的必屈膝；狂妄的必降卑。在那日，惟独耶和华被尊崇；
{Isa 2:18}  And the idols shall utterly pass away.
{Isa 2:18}  偶像必全然废弃。
{Isa 2:19}  And people shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
{Isa 2:19}  耶和华兴起，使地大震动的时候，人就进入石洞，进入土穴，躲避耶和华的惊吓和他威严的荣光。
{Isa 2:20}  In that day mankind will cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats,
{Isa 2:20}  到那日，人必将为拜而造的金偶像、银偶像抛给田鼠和蝙蝠。
{Isa 2:21}  to enter the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
{Isa 2:21}  到耶和华兴起，使地大震动的时候，人好进入磐石洞中和岩石穴里，躲避耶和华的惊吓和他威严的荣光。
{Isa 2:22}  Stop regarding man in whose nostrils is breath, for of what account is he?
{Isa 2:22}  你们休要倚靠世人。他鼻孔里不过有气息；他在一切事上可算什么呢？
{Isa 3:1}   For behold, the Lord GOD of hosts is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and supply, all support of bread, and all support of water;
{Isa 3:1}   主万军之耶和华从耶路撒冷和犹大，除掉众人所倚靠的，所仗赖的，就是所倚靠的粮，所仗赖的水；
{Isa 3:2}   the mighty man and the soldier, the judge and the prophet, the diviner and the elder,
{Isa 3:2}   除掉勇士和战士，审判官和先知，占卜的和长老，
{Isa 3:3}   the captain of fifty and the man of rank, the counselor and the skillful magician and the expert in charms.
{Isa 3:3}   五十夫长和尊贵人，谋士和有巧艺的，以及妙行法术的。
{Isa 3:4}   And I will make boys their princes, and infants shall rule over them.
{Isa 3:4}   主说：我必使孩童作他们的首领，使婴孩辖管他们。
{Isa 3:5}   And the people will oppress one another, every one his fellow and every one his neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder, and the despised to the honorable.
{Isa 3:5}   百姓要彼此欺压；各人受邻舍的欺压。少年人必侮慢老年人；卑贱人必侮慢尊贵人。
{Isa 3:6}   For a man will take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying: "You have a cloak; you shall be our leader, and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule";
{Isa 3:6}   人在父家拉住弟兄，说：你有衣服，可以作我们的官长。这败落的事归在你手下吧！
{Isa 3:7}   in that day he will speak out, saying: "I will not be a healer; in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; you shall not make me leader of the people."
{Isa 3:7}   那时，他必扬声说：我不作医治你们的人；因我家中没有粮食，也没有衣服，你们不可立我作百姓的官长。
{Isa 3:8}   For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, because their speech and their deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.
{Isa 3:8}   耶路撒冷败落，犹大倾倒；因为他们的舌头和行为与耶和华反对，惹了他荣光的眼目。
{Isa 3:9}   For the look on their faces bears witness against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves.
{Isa 3:9}   他们的面色证明自己的不正；他们述说自己的罪恶，并不隐瞒，好像所多玛一样。他们有祸了！因为作恶自害。
{Isa 3:10}  Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
{Isa 3:10}  你们要论义人说：他必享福乐，因为要吃自己行为所结的果子。
{Isa 3:11}  Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for what his hands have dealt out shall be done to him.
{Isa 3:11}  恶人有祸了！他必遭灾难！因为要照自己手所行的受报应。
{Isa 3:12}  My people--infants are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, your guides mislead you and they have swallowed up the course of your paths.
{Isa 3:12}  至于我的百姓，孩童欺压他们，妇女辖管他们。我的百姓啊，引导你的使你走错，并毁坏你所行的道路。
{Isa 3:13}  The LORD has taken his place to contend; he stands to judge peoples.
{Isa 3:13}  耶和华起来辩论，站着审判众民。
{Isa 3:14}  The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: "It is you who have devoured the vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
{Isa 3:14}  耶和华必审问他民中的长老和首领，说：吃尽葡萄园果子的就是你们；向贫穷人所夺的都在你们家中。
{Isa 3:15}  What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor?" declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
{Isa 3:15}  主万军之耶和华说：你们为何压制我的百姓，搓磨贫穷人的脸呢？
{Isa 3:16}  The LORD said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks, glancing wantonly with their eyes, mincing along as they go, tinkling with their feet,
{Isa 3:16}  耶和华又说：因为锡安的女子狂傲，行走挺项，卖弄眼目，俏步徐行，脚下玎珰。
{Isa 3:17}  therefore the Lord will strike with a scab the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will lay bare their secret parts.
{Isa 3:17}  所以，主必使锡安的女子头长秃疮；耶和华又使他们赤露下体。
{Isa 3:18}  In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets, the headbands, and the crescents;
{Isa 3:18}  到那日，主必除掉他们华美的脚钏、发网、月牙圈、
{Isa 3:19}  the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarves;
{Isa 3:19}  耳环、手镯、蒙脸的帕子、
{Isa 3:20}  the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets;
{Isa 3:20}  华冠、足链、华带、香盒、符囊、
{Isa 3:21}  the signet rings and nose rings;
{Isa 3:21}  戒指、鼻环、
{Isa 3:22}  the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags;
{Isa 3:22}  吉服、外套、云肩、荷包、
{Isa 3:23}  the mirrors, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.
{Isa 3:23}  手镜、细麻衣、裹头巾、蒙身的帕子。
{Isa 3:24}  Instead of perfume there will be rottenness; and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a skirt of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.
{Isa 3:24}  必有臭烂代替馨香，绳子代替腰带，光秃代替美发，麻衣系腰代替华服，烙伤代替美容。
{Isa 3:25}  Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle.
{Isa 3:25}  你的男丁必倒在刀下；你的勇士必死在阵上。
{Isa 3:26}  And her gates shall lament and mourn; empty, she shall sit on the ground.
{Isa 3:26}  锡安（原文作他）的城门必悲伤、哀号；他必荒凉坐在地上。
{Isa 4:1}   And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach."
{Isa 4:1}   在那日，七个女人必拉住一个男人，说：“我们吃自己的食物，穿自己的衣服，但求你许我们归你名下；求你除掉我们的羞耻。”
{Isa 4:2}   In that day the branch of the LORD shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be the pride and honor of the survivors of Israel.
{Isa 4:2}   到那日，耶和华发生的苗必华美尊荣，地的出产必为以色列逃脱的人显为荣华茂盛。
{Isa 4:3}   And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem,
{Isa 4:3}   主以公义的灵和焚烧的灵，将锡安女子的污秽洗去，又将耶路撒冷中杀人的血除净。那时，剩在锡安、留在耶路撒冷的，就是一切住耶路撒冷、在生命册上记名的，必称为圣。
{Isa 4:4}   when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.
{Isa 4:4}   (SEE 4:3)
{Isa 4:5}   Then the LORD will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a canopy.
{Isa 4:5}   耶和华也必在锡安全山，并各会众以上，使白日有烟云，黑夜有火焰的光。因为在全荣耀之上必有遮蔽。
{Isa 4:6}   There will be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.
{Isa 4:6}   必有亭子，白日可以得荫避暑，也可以作为藏身之处，躲避狂风暴雨。
{Isa 5:1}   Let me sing for my beloved my love song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
{Isa 5:1}   我要为我所亲爱的唱歌，是我所爱者的歌，论他葡萄园的事：我所亲爱的有葡萄园在肥美的山冈上。
{Isa 5:2}   He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; and he looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.
{Isa 5:2}   他刨挖园子，捡去石头，栽种上等的葡萄树，在园中盖了一座楼，又凿出压酒池；指望结好葡萄，反倒结了野葡萄。
{Isa 5:3}   And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
{Isa 5:3}   耶路撒冷的居民和犹大人哪，请你们现今在我与我的葡萄园中，断定是非。
{Isa 5:4}   What more was there to do for my vineyard, that I have not done in it? When I looked for it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?
{Isa 5:4}   我为我葡萄园所做之外，还有什么可做的呢？我指望结好葡萄，怎么倒结了野葡萄呢？
{Isa 5:5}   And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down.
{Isa 5:5}   现在我告诉你们，我要向我葡萄园怎样行：我必撤去篱笆，使他被吞灭，拆毁墙垣，使他被践踏。
{Isa 5:6}   I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and briers and thorns shall grow up; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
{Isa 5:6}   我必使他荒废，不再修理，不再锄刨，荆棘蒺藜倒要生长。我也必命云不降雨在其上。
{Isa 5:7}   For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting; and he looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold, an outcry!
{Isa 5:7}   万军之耶和华的葡萄园就是以色列家；他所喜爱的树就是犹大人。他指望的是公平，谁知倒有暴虐（或作：倒流人血）；指望的是公义，谁知倒有冤声。
{Isa 5:8}   Woe to those who join house to house, who add field to field, until there is no more room, and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land.
{Isa 5:8}   祸哉！那些以房接房，以地连地，以致不留余地的，只顾自己独居境内。
{Isa 5:9}   The LORD of hosts has sworn in my hearing: "Surely many houses shall be desolate, large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.
{Isa 5:9}   我耳闻万军之耶和华说：必有许多又大又美的房屋成为荒凉，无人居住。
{Isa 5:10}  For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah."
{Isa 5:10}  三十亩葡萄园只出一罢特酒；一贺梅珥谷种只结一伊法粮食。
{Isa 5:11}  Woe to those who rise early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink, who tarry late into the evening as wine inflames them!
{Isa 5:11}  祸哉！那些清早起来追求浓酒，留连到夜深，甚至因酒发烧的人。
{Isa 5:12}  They have lyre and harp, tambourine and flute and wine at their feasts, but they do not regard the deeds of the LORD, or see the work of his hands.
{Isa 5:12}  他们在筵席上弹琴，鼓瑟，击鼓，吹笛，饮酒，却不顾念耶和华的作为，也不留心他手所做的。
{Isa 5:13}  Therefore my people go into exile for lack of knowledge; their honored men go hungry, and their multitude is parched with thirst.
{Isa 5:13}  所以，我的百姓因无知就被掳去；他们的尊贵人甚是饥饿，群众极其干渴。
{Isa 5:14}  Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite and opened its mouth beyond measure, and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude will go down, her revelers and he who exults in her.
{Isa 5:14}  故此，阴间扩张其欲，开了无限量的口；他们的荣耀、群众、繁华，并快乐的人都落在其中。
{Isa 5:15}  Man is humbled, and each one is brought low, and the eyes of the haughty are brought low.
{Isa 5:15}  卑贱人被压服；尊贵人降为卑；眼目高傲的人也降为卑。
{Isa 5:16}  But the LORD of hosts is exalted in justice, and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.
{Isa 5:16}  惟有万军之耶和华因公平而崇高；圣者神因公义显为圣。
{Isa 5:17}  Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture, and nomads shall eat among the ruins of the rich.
{Isa 5:17}  那时，羊羔必来吃草，如同在自己的草场；丰肥人的荒场被游行的人吃尽。
{Isa 5:18}  Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, who draw sin as with cart ropes,
{Isa 5:18}  祸哉！那些以虚假之细绳牵罪孽的人！他们又像以套绳拉罪恶，
{Isa 5:19}  who say: "Let him be quick, let him speed his work that we may see it; let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near, and let it come, that we may know it!"
{Isa 5:19}  说：任他急速行，赶快成就他的作为，使我们看看；任以色列圣者所谋划的临近成就，使我们知道。
{Isa 5:20}  Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
{Isa 5:20}  祸哉！那些称恶为善，称善为恶，以暗为光，以光为暗，以苦为甜，以甜为苦的人。
{Isa 5:21}  Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and shrewd in their own sight!
{Isa 5:21}  祸哉！那些自以为有智慧，自看为通达的人。
{Isa 5:22}  Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine, and valiant men in mixing strong drink,
{Isa 5:22}  祸哉！那些勇于饮酒，以能力调浓酒的人。
{Isa 5:23}  who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his right!
{Isa 5:23}  他们因受贿赂，就称恶人为义，将义人的义夺去。
{Isa 5:24}  Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom go up like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
{Isa 5:24}  火苗怎样吞灭碎秸，干草怎样落在火焰之中，照样，他们的根必像朽物，他们的花必像灰尘飞腾；因为他们厌弃万军之耶和华的训诲，藐视以色列圣者的言语。
{Isa 5:25}  Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he stretched out his hand against them and struck them, and the mountains quaked; and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
{Isa 5:25}  所以，耶和华的怒气向他的百姓发作。他的手伸出攻击他们，山岭就震动；他们的尸首在街市上好像粪土。虽然如此，他的怒气还未转消；他的手仍伸不缩。
{Isa 5:26}  He will raise a signal for nations far away, and whistle for them from the ends of the earth; and behold, quickly, speedily they come!
{Isa 5:26}  他必竖立大旗，招远方的国民，发嘶声叫他们从地极而来，看哪，他们必急速奔来。
{Isa 5:27}  None is weary, none stumbles, none slumbers or sleeps, not a waistband is loose, not a sandal strap broken;
{Isa 5:27}  其中没有疲倦的，绊跌的；没有打盹的，睡觉的；腰带并不放松，鞋带也不折断。
{Isa 5:28}  their arrows are sharp, all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs seem like flint, and their wheels like the whirlwind.
{Isa 5:28}  他们的箭快利，弓也上了弦。马蹄算如坚石，车轮好像旋风。
{Isa 5:29}  Their roaring is like a lion, like young lions they roar; they growl and seize their prey; they carry it off, and none can rescue.
{Isa 5:29}  他们要吼叫，像母狮子，咆哮，像少壮狮子；他们要咆哮抓食，坦然叼去，无人救回。
{Isa 5:30}  They will growl over it on that day, like the growling of the sea. And if one looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress; and the light is darkened by its clouds.
{Isa 5:30}  那日，他们要向以色列人吼叫，像海浪砰訇；人若望地，只见黑暗艰难，光明在云中变为昏暗。
{Isa 6:1}   In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.
{Isa 6:1}   当乌西雅王崩的那年，我见主坐在高高的宝座上。他的衣裳垂下，遮满圣殿。
{Isa 6:2}   Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
{Isa 6:2}   其上有撒拉弗侍立，各有六个翅膀：用两个翅膀遮脸，两个翅膀遮脚，两个翅膀飞翔；
{Isa 6:3}   And one called to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!"
{Isa 6:3}   彼此呼喊说：圣哉！圣哉！圣哉！万军之耶和华；他的荣光充满全地！
{Isa 6:4}   And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
{Isa 6:4}   因呼喊者的声音，门槛的根基震动，殿充满了烟云。
{Isa 6:5}   And I said: "Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!"
{Isa 6:5}   那时我说：“祸哉！我灭亡了！因为我是嘴唇不洁的人，又住在嘴唇不洁的民中，又因我眼见大君王万军之耶和华。”
{Isa 6:6}   Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
{Isa 6:6}   有一撒拉弗飞到我跟前，手里拿着红炭，是用火剪从坛上取下来的，
{Isa 6:7}   And he touched my mouth and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for."
{Isa 6:7}   将炭沾我的口，说：“看哪，这炭沾了你的嘴，你的罪孽便除掉，你的罪恶就赦免了。”
{Isa 6:8}   And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here I am! Send me."
{Isa 6:8}   我又听见主的声音说：“我可以差遣谁呢？谁肯为我们去呢？”我说：“我在这里，请差遣我！”
{Isa 6:9}   And he said, "Go, and say to this people: "'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.'
{Isa 6:9}   他说：“你去告诉这百姓说：你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不晓得。
{Isa 6:10}  Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."
{Isa 6:10}  要使这百姓心蒙脂油，耳朵发沉，眼睛昏迷；恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，便得医治。”
{Isa 6:11}  Then I said, "How long, O Lord?" And he said: "Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is a desolate waste,
{Isa 6:11}  我就说：“主啊，这到几时为止呢？”他说：直到城邑荒凉，无人居住，房屋空闲无人，地土极其荒凉。
{Isa 6:12}  and the LORD removes people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
{Isa 6:12}  并且耶和华将人迁到远方，在这境内撇下的地土很多。
{Isa 6:13}  And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains when it is felled." The holy seed is its stump.
{Isa 6:13}  境内剩下的人若还有十分之一，也必被吞灭，像栗树、橡树虽被砍伐，树子却仍存留。这圣洁的种类在国中也是如此。
{Isa 7:1}   In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against it.
{Isa 7:1}   乌西雅的孙子、约坦的儿子、犹大王亚哈斯在位的时候，亚兰王利汛和利玛利的儿子、以色列王比加上来攻打耶路撒冷，却不能攻取。
{Isa 7:2}   When the house of David was told, "Syria is in league with Ephraim," the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
{Isa 7:2}   有人告诉大卫家说：“亚兰与以法莲已经同盟。”王的心和百姓的心就都跳动，好像林中的树被风吹动一样。
{Isa 7:3}   And the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer's Field.
{Isa 7:3}   耶和华对以赛亚说：“你和你的儿子施亚雅述出去，到上池的水沟头，在漂布地的大路上，去迎接亚哈斯，
{Isa 7:4}   And say to him, 'Be careful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah.
{Isa 7:4}   对他说：‘你要谨慎安静，不要因亚兰王利汛和利玛利的儿子这两个冒烟的火把头所发的烈怒害怕，也不要心里胆怯。
{Isa 7:5}   Because Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying,
{Isa 7:5}   因为亚兰和以法莲，并利玛利的儿子，设恶谋害你，
{Isa 7:6}   "Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,"
{Isa 7:6}   说：我们可以上去攻击犹大，扰乱他，攻破他，在其中立他比勒的儿子为王。
{Isa 7:7}   thus says the Lord GOD: "'It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.
{Isa 7:7}   所以主耶和华如此说：这所谋的必立不住，也不得成就。
{Isa 7:8}   For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. And within sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered from being a people.
{Isa 7:8}   原来亚兰的首城是大马色；大马色的首领是利汛。六十五年之内，以法莲必然破坏，不再成为国民。
{Isa 7:9}   And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you are not firm in faith, you will not be firm at all.'"
{Isa 7:9}   以法莲的首城是撒玛利亚；撒玛利亚的首领是利玛利的儿子。你们若是不信，定然不得立稳。’”
{Isa 7:10}  Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,
{Isa 7:10}  耶和华又晓谕亚哈斯说：
{Isa 7:11}  "Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven."
{Isa 7:11}  “你向耶和华你的神求一个兆头：或求显在深处，或求显在高处。”
{Isa 7:12}  But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test."
{Isa 7:12}  亚哈斯说：“我不求；我不试探耶和华。”
{Isa 7:13}  And he said, "Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also?
{Isa 7:13}  以赛亚说：“大卫家啊，你们当听！你们使人厌烦岂算小事，还要使我的神厌烦吗？
{Isa 7:14}  Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
{Isa 7:14}  因此，主自己要给你们一个兆头，必有童女怀孕生子，给他起名叫以马内利（就是神与我们同在的意思）。
{Isa 7:15}  He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good.
{Isa 7:15}  到他晓得弃恶择善的时候，他必吃奶油与蜂蜜。
{Isa 7:16}  For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted.
{Isa 7:16}  因为在这孩子还不晓得弃恶择善之先，你所憎恶的那二王之地必致见弃。
{Isa 7:17}  The LORD will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah--the king of Assyria."
{Isa 7:17}  耶和华必使亚述王攻击你的日子临到你和你的百姓，并你的父家，自从以法莲离开犹大以来，未曾有这样的日子。
{Isa 7:18}  In that day the LORD will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
{Isa 7:18}  “那时，耶和华要发嘶声，使埃及江河源头的苍蝇和亚述地的蜂子飞来；
{Isa 7:19}  And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures.
{Isa 7:19}  都必飞来，落在荒凉的谷内、磐石的穴里，和一切荆棘篱笆中，并一切的草场上。
{Isa 7:20}  In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired beyond the River--with the king of Assyria--the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.
{Isa 7:20}  “那时，主必用大河外赁的剃头刀，就是亚述王，剃去头发和脚上的毛，并要剃净胡须。
{Isa 7:21}  In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,
{Isa 7:21}  “那时，一个人要养活一只母牛犊，两只母绵羊；
{Isa 7:22}  and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey.
{Isa 7:22}  因为出的奶多，他就得吃奶油，在境内所剩的人都要吃奶油与蜂蜜。
{Isa 7:23}  In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns.
{Isa 7:23}  “从前，凡种一千棵葡萄树、值银一千舍客勒的地方，到那时必长荆棘和蒺藜。
{Isa 7:24}  With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns.
{Isa 7:24}  人上那里去，必带弓箭，因为遍地满了荆棘和蒺藜。
{Isa 7:25}  And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.
{Isa 7:25}  所有用锄刨挖的山地，你因怕荆棘和蒺藜，不敢上那里去；只可成了放牛之处，为羊践踏之地。”
{Isa 8:1}   Then the LORD said to me, "Take a large tablet and write on it in common characters, 'Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz.'
{Isa 8:1}   耶和华对我说：“你取一个大牌，拿人所用的笔（或作：人常用的字），写上‘玛黑珥沙拉勒哈施罢斯’（就是掳掠速临、抢夺快到的意思）。
{Isa 8:2}   And I will get reliable witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me."
{Isa 8:2}   我要用诚实的见证人，祭司乌利亚和耶比利家的儿子撒迦利亚记录这事。”
{Isa 8:3}   And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
{Isa 8:3}   我以赛亚与妻子（原文作女先知）同室；他怀孕生子，耶和华就对我说：“给他起名叫玛黑珥沙拉勒哈施罢斯；
{Isa 8:4}   for before the boy knows how to cry 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria."
{Isa 8:4}   因为在这小孩子不晓得叫父叫母之先，大马色的财宝和撒玛利亚的掳物必在亚述王面前搬了去。”
{Isa 8:5}   The LORD spoke to me again:
{Isa 8:5}   耶和华又晓谕我说：
{Isa 8:6}   "Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
{Isa 8:6}   “这百姓既厌弃西罗亚缓流的水，喜悦利汛和利玛利的儿子；
{Isa 8:7}   therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks,
{Isa 8:7}   因此，主必使大河翻腾的水猛然冲来，就是亚述王和他所有的威势，必漫过一切的水道，涨过两岸；
{Isa 8:8}   and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck, and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel."
{Isa 8:8}   必冲入犹大，涨溢泛滥，直到颈项。以马内利啊，他展开翅膀，遍满你的地。”
{Isa 8:9}   Be broken, you peoples, and be shattered; give ear, all you far countries; strap on your armor and be shattered; strap on your armor and be shattered.
{Isa 8:9}   列国的人民哪，任凭你们喧嚷，终必破坏；远方的众人哪，当侧耳而听！任凭你们束起腰来，终必破坏；你们束起腰来，终必破坏。
{Isa 8:10}  Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing; speak a word, but it will not stand, for God is with us.
{Isa 8:10}  任凭你们同谋，终归无有；任凭你们言定，终不成立；因为神与我们同在。
{Isa 8:11}  For the LORD spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:
{Isa 8:11}  耶和华以大能的手，指教我不可行这百姓所行的道，对我这样说：
{Isa 8:12}  "Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.
{Isa 8:12}  “这百姓说同谋背叛，你们不要说同谋背叛。他们所怕的，你们不要怕，也不要畏惧。
{Isa 8:13}  But the LORD of hosts, him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
{Isa 8:13}  但要尊万军之耶和华为圣，以他为你们所当怕的，所当畏惧的。
{Isa 8:14}  And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{Isa 8:14}  他必作为圣所，却向以色列两家作绊脚的石头，跌人的磐石；向耶路撒冷的居民作为圈套和网罗。
{Isa 8:15}  And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken."
{Isa 8:15}  许多人必在其上绊脚跌倒，而且跌碎，并陷入网罗，被缠住。”
{Isa 8:16}  Bind up the testimony; seal the teaching among my disciples.
{Isa 8:16}  你要卷起律法书，在我门徒中间封住训诲。
{Isa 8:17}  I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.
{Isa 8:17}  我要等候那掩面不顾雅各家的耶和华；我也要仰望他。
{Isa 8:18}  Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
{Isa 8:18}  看哪，我与耶和华所给我的儿女，就是从住在锡安山万军之耶和华来的，在以色列中作为预兆和奇迹。
{Isa 8:19}  And when they say to you, "Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter," should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living?
{Isa 8:19}  有人对你们说：“当求问那些交鬼的和行巫术的，就是声音绵蛮，言语微细的。”你们便回答说：“百姓不当求问自己的神吗？岂可为活人求问死人呢？”
{Isa 8:20}  To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn.
{Isa 8:20}  人当以训诲和法度为标准；他们所说的，若不与此相符，必不得见晨光。
{Isa 8:21}  They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against their king and their God, and turn their faces upward.
{Isa 8:21}  他们必经过这地，受艰难，受饥饿；饥饿的时候，心中焦躁，咒骂自己的君王和自己的神。
{Isa 8:22}  And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into thick darkness.
{Isa 8:22}  仰观上天，俯察下地，不料，尽是艰难、黑暗，和幽暗的痛苦。他们必被赶入乌黑的黑暗中去。
{Isa 9:1}   But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
{Isa 9:1}   但那受过痛苦的必不再见幽暗。从前神使西布伦地和拿弗他利地被藐视，末后却使这沿海的路，约但河外，外邦人的加利利地得着荣耀。
{Isa 9:2}   The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.
{Isa 9:2}   在黑暗中行走的百姓看见了大光；住在死荫之地的人有光照耀他们。
{Isa 9:3}   You have multiplied the nation; you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as they are glad when they divide the spoil.
{Isa 9:3}   你使这国民繁多，加增他们的喜乐；他们在你面前欢喜，好像收割的欢喜，像人分掳物那样的快乐。
{Isa 9:4}   For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.
{Isa 9:4}   因为他们所负的重轭和肩头上的杖，并欺压他们人的棍，你都已经折断，好像在米甸的日子一样。
{Isa 9:5}   For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire.
{Isa 9:5}   战士在乱杀之间所穿戴的盔甲，并那滚在血中的衣服，都必作为可烧的，当作火柴。
{Isa 9:6}   For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
{Isa 9:6}   因有一婴孩为我们而生；有一子赐给我们。政权必担在他的肩头上；他名称为“奇妙策士、全能的神、永在的父、和平的君”。
{Isa 9:7}   Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
{Isa 9:7}   他的政权与平安必加增无穷。他必在大卫的宝座上治理他的国，以公平公义使国坚定稳固，从今直到永远。万军之耶和华的热心必成就这事。
{Isa 9:8}   The Lord has sent a word against Jacob, and it will fall on Israel;
{Isa 9:8}   主使一言入于雅各家，落于以色列家。
{Isa 9:9}   and all the people will know, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart:
{Isa 9:9}   这众百姓，就是以法莲和撒玛利亚的居民，都要知道；他们凭骄傲自大的心说：
{Isa 9:10}  "The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place."
{Isa 9:10}  砖墙塌了，我们却要凿石头建筑；桑树砍了，我们却要换香柏树。
{Isa 9:11}  But the LORD raises the adversaries of Rezin against him, and stirs up his enemies.
{Isa 9:11}  因此，耶和华要高举利汛的敌人来攻击以色列，并要激动以色列的仇敌。
{Isa 9:12}  The Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
{Isa 9:12}  东有亚兰人，西有非利士人；他们张口要吞吃以色列。虽然如此，耶和华的怒气还未转消；他的手仍伸不缩。
{Isa 9:13}  The people did not turn to him who struck them, nor inquire of the LORD of hosts.
{Isa 9:13}  这百姓还没有归向击打他们的主，也没有寻求万军之耶和华。
{Isa 9:14}  So the LORD cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed in one day--
{Isa 9:14}  因此，耶和华一日之间必从以色列中剪除头与尾，棕枝与芦苇，
{Isa 9:15}  the elder and honored man is the head, and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail;
{Isa 9:15}  长老和尊贵人就是头，以谎言教人的先知就是尾。
{Isa 9:16}  for those who guide this people have been leading them astray, and those who are guided by them are swallowed up.
{Isa 9:16}  因为，引导这百姓的使他们走错了路；被引导的都必败亡。
{Isa 9:17}  Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men, and has no compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is godless and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
{Isa 9:17}  所以，主必不喜悦他们的少年人，也不怜恤他们的孤儿寡妇；因为，各人是亵渎的，是行恶的，并且各人的口都说愚妄的话。虽然如此，耶和华的怒气还未转消；他的手仍伸不缩。
{Isa 9:18}  For wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns; it kindles the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
{Isa 9:18}  邪恶像火焚烧，烧灭荆棘和蒺藜，在稠密的树林中着起来，就成为烟柱，旋转上腾。
{Isa 9:19}  Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts the land is scorched, and the people are like fuel for the fire; no one spares another.
{Isa 9:19}  因万军之耶和华的烈怒，地都烧遍；百姓成为火柴；无人怜爱弟兄。
{Isa 9:20}  They slice meat on the right, but are still hungry, and they devour on the left, but are not satisfied; each devours the flesh of his own arm,
{Isa 9:20}  有人右边抢夺，仍受饥饿，左边吞吃，仍不饱足；各人吃自己膀臂上的肉。
{Isa 9:21}  Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim devours Manasseh; together they are against Judah. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
{Isa 9:21}  玛拿西吞吃（或作：攻击；下同）以法莲；以法莲吞吃玛拿西，又一同攻击犹大。虽然如此，耶和华的怒气还未转消；他的手仍伸不缩。
{Isa 10:1}  Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees, and the writers who keep writing oppression,
{Isa 10:1}  祸哉！那些设立不义之律例的和记录奸诈之判语的，
{Isa 10:2}  to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
{Isa 10:2}  为要屈枉穷乏人，夺去我民中困苦人的理，以寡妇当作掳物，以孤儿当作掠物。
{Isa 10:3}  What will you do on the day of punishment, in the ruin that will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth?
{Isa 10:3}  到降罚的日子，有灾祸从远方临到，那时，你们怎样行呢？你们向谁逃奔求救呢？你们的荣耀（或作：财宝）存留何处呢？
{Isa 10:4}  Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
{Isa 10:4}  他们只得屈身在被掳的人以下，仆倒在被杀的人以下。虽然如此，耶和华的怒气还未转消；他的手仍伸不缩。
{Isa 10:5}  Woe to Assyria, the rod of my anger; the staff in their hands is my fury!
{Isa 10:5}  亚述是我怒气的棍，手中拿我恼恨的杖。
{Isa 10:6}  Against a godless nation I send him, and against the people of my wrath I command him, to take spoil and seize plunder, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
{Isa 10:6}  我要打发他攻击亵渎的国民，吩咐他攻击我所恼怒的百姓，抢财为掳物，夺货为掠物，将他们践踏，像街上的泥土一样。
{Isa 10:7}  But he does not so intend, and his heart does not so think; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few;
{Isa 10:7}  然而，他不是这样的意思；他心也不这样打算。他心里倒想毁灭，剪除不少的国。
{Isa 10:8}  for he says: "Are not my commanders all kings?
{Isa 10:8}  他说：我的臣仆岂不都是王吗？
{Isa 10:9}  Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?
{Isa 10:9}  迦勒挪岂不像迦基米施吗？哈马岂不像亚珥拔吗？撒玛利亚岂不像大马色吗？
{Isa 10:10} As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols, whose carved images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
{Isa 10:10} 我手已经构到有偶像的国；这些国雕刻的偶像过于耶路撒冷和撒玛利亚的偶像。
{Isa 10:11} shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her images?"
{Isa 10:11} 我怎样待撒玛利亚和其中的偶像，岂不照样待耶路撒冷和其中的偶像吗？
{Isa 10:12} When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes.
{Isa 10:12} 主在锡安山和耶路撒冷成就他一切工作的时候，主说：“我必罚亚述王自大的心和他高傲眼目的荣耀。”
{Isa 10:13} For he says: "By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding; I remove the boundaries of peoples, and plunder their treasures; like a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones.
{Isa 10:13} 因为他说：我所成就的事是靠我手的能力和我的智慧，我本有聪明。我挪移列国的地界，抢夺他们所积蓄的财宝；并且我像勇士，使坐宝座的降为卑。
{Isa 10:14} My hand has found like a nest the wealth of the peoples; and as one gathers eggs that have been forsaken, so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved a wing or opened the mouth or chirped."
{Isa 10:14} 我的手构到列国的财宝，好像人构到鸟窝；我也得了全地，好像人拾起所弃的雀蛋。没有动翅膀的；没有张嘴的，也没有鸣叫的。
{Isa 10:15} Shall the axe boast over him who hews with it, or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield him who lifts it, or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!
{Isa 10:15} 斧岂可向用斧砍木的自夸呢？锯岂可向用锯的自大呢？好比棍抡起那举棍的，好比杖举起那非木的人。
{Isa 10:16} Therefore the Lord GOD of hosts will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors, and under his glory a burning will be kindled, like the burning of fire.
{Isa 10:16} 因此，主万军之耶和华必使亚述王的肥壮人变为瘦弱，在他的荣华之下必有火着起，如同焚烧一样。

{Isa 10:17} 以色列的光必如火；他的圣者必如火焰。在一日之间，将亚述王的荆棘和蒺藜焚烧净尽；
{Isa 10:18} The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land the LORD will destroy, both soul and body, and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.
{Isa 10:18} 又将他树林和肥田的荣耀全然烧尽，好像拿军旗的昏过去一样。
{Isa 10:19} The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down.
{Isa 10:19} 他林中剩下的树必稀少，就是孩子也能写其数。
{Isa 10:20} In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean on him who struck them, but will lean on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
{Isa 10:20} 到那日，以色列所剩下的和雅各家所逃脱的，不再倚靠那击打他们的，却要诚实倚靠耶和华以色列的圣者。
{Isa 10:21} A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
{Isa 10:21} 所剩下的，就是雅各家所剩下的，必归回全能的神。
{Isa 10:22} For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness.
{Isa 10:22} 以色列啊，你的百姓虽多如海沙，惟有剩下的归回。原来灭绝的事已定，必有公义施行，如水涨溢。
{Isa 10:23} For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth.
{Isa 10:23} 因为主万军之耶和华在全地之中必成就所定规的结局。
{Isa 10:24} Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts: "O my people, who dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you as the Egyptians did.
{Isa 10:24} 所以，主万军之耶和华如此说：“住锡安我的百姓啊，亚述王虽然用棍击打你，又照埃及的样子举杖攻击你，你却不要怕他。
{Isa 10:25} For in a very little while my fury will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction.
{Isa 10:25} 因为还有一点点时候，向你们发的忿恨就要完毕，我的怒气要向他发作，使他灭亡。
{Isa 10:26} And the LORD of hosts will wield against them a whip, as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt.
{Isa 10:26} 万军之耶和华要兴起鞭来攻击他，好像在俄立磐石那里杀戮米甸人一样。耶和华的杖要向海伸出，把杖举起，像在埃及一样。
{Isa 10:27} And in that day his burden will depart from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck; and the yoke will be broken because of the fat."
{Isa 10:27} 到那日，亚述王的重担必离开你的肩头；他的轭必离开你的颈项；那轭也必因肥壮的缘故撑断（或作：因膏油的缘故毁坏）。”
{Isa 10:28} He has come to Aiath; he has passed through Migron; at Michmash he stores his baggage;
{Isa 10:28} 亚述王来到亚叶，经过米矶仑，在密抹安放辎重。
{Isa 10:29} they have crossed over the pass; at Geba they lodge for the night; Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul has fled.
{Isa 10:29} 他们过了隘口，在迦巴住宿。拉玛人战兢；扫罗的基比亚人逃跑。

{Isa 14:22} 万军之耶和华说：我必兴起攻击他们，将巴比伦的名号和所余剩的人，连子带孙一并剪除。这是耶和华说的。
{Isa 14:23} "And I will make it a possession of the hedgehog, and pools of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction," declares the LORD of hosts.
{Isa 14:23} 我必使巴比伦为箭猪所得，又变为水池；我要用灭亡的扫扫净他。这是万军之耶和华说的。
{Isa 14:24} The LORD of hosts has sworn: "As I have planned, so shall it be, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand,
{Isa 14:24} 万军之耶和华起誓说：我怎样思想，必照样成就；我怎样定意，必照样成立，
{Isa 14:25} that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains trample him underfoot; and his yoke shall depart from them, and his burden from their shoulder."
{Isa 14:25} 就是在我地上打折亚述人，在我山上将他践踏。他加的轭必离开以色列人；他加的重担必离开他们的肩头。
{Isa 14:26} This is the purpose that is purposed concerning the whole earth, and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.
{Isa 14:26} 这是向全地所定的旨意；这是向万国所伸出的手。
{Isa 14:27} For the LORD of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it? His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?
{Isa 14:27} 万军之耶和华既然定意，谁能废弃呢？他的手已经伸出，谁能转回呢？
{Isa 14:28} In the year that King Ahaz died came this oracle:
{Isa 14:28} 亚哈斯王崩的那年，就有以下的默示：
{Isa 14:29} Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of you, that the rod that struck you is broken, for from the serpent's root will come forth an adder, and its fruit will be a flying fiery serpent.
{Isa 14:29} 非利士全地啊，不要因击打你的杖折断就喜乐。因为从蛇的根必生出毒蛇；他所生的是火焰的飞龙。
{Isa 14:30} And the firstborn of the poor will graze, and the needy lie down in safety; but I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant it will slay.
{Isa 14:30} 贫寒人的长子必有所食；穷乏人必安然躺卧。我必以饥荒治死你的根；你所余剩的人必被杀戮。
{Isa 14:31} Wail, O gate; cry out, O city; melt in fear, O Philistia, all of you! For smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.
{Isa 14:31} 门哪，应当哀号！城啊，应当呼喊！非利士全地啊，你都消化了！因为有烟从北方出来，他行伍中并无乱队的。
{Isa 14:32} What will one answer the messengers of the nation? "The LORD has founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of his people find refuge."
{Isa 14:32} 可怎样回答外邦（或指非利士）的使者呢？必说：耶和华建立了锡安；他百姓中的困苦人必投奔在其中。
{Isa 15:1}  An oracle concerning Moab. Because Ar of Moab is laid waste in a night, Moab is undone; because Kir of Moab is laid waste in a night, Moab is undone.
{Isa 15:1}  论摩押的默示：一夜之间，摩押的亚珥变为荒废，归于无有；一夜之间，摩押的基珥变为荒废，归于无有。
{Isa 15:2}  He has gone up to the temple, and to Dibon, to the high places to weep; over Nebo and over Medeba Moab wails. On every head is baldness; every beard is shorn;
{Isa 15:2}  他们上巴益，又往底本，到高处去哭泣。摩押人因尼波和米底巴哀号，各人头上光秃，胡须剃净。
{Isa 15:3}  in the streets they wear sackcloth; on the housetops and in the squares everyone wails and melts in tears.
{Isa 15:3}  他们在街市上都腰束麻布，在房顶上和宽阔处俱各哀号，眼泪汪汪。
{Isa 15:4}  Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voice is heard as far as Jahaz; therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembles.
{Isa 15:4}  希实本和以利亚利悲哀的声音达到雅杂，所以摩押带兵器的高声喊嚷，人心战兢。
{Isa 15:5}  My heart cries out for Moab; her fugitives flee to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah. For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping; on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of destruction;
{Isa 15:5}  我心为摩押悲哀；他的贵胄（或作：逃民）逃到琐珥，到伊基拉施利施亚。他们上鲁希坡，随走随哭；在何罗念的路上，因毁灭举起哀声。
{Isa 15:6}  the waters of Nimrim are a desolation; the grass is withered, the vegetation fails, the greenery is no more.
{Isa 15:6}  因为宁林的水成为干涸，青草枯干，嫩草灭没，青绿之物，一无所有。
{Isa 15:7}  Therefore the abundance they have gained and what they have laid up they carry away over the Brook of the Willows.
{Isa 15:7}  因此，摩押人所得的财物和所积蓄的都要运过柳树河。
{Isa 15:8}  For a cry has gone around the land of Moab; her wailing reaches to Eglaim; her wailing reaches to Beer-elim.
{Isa 15:8}  哀声遍闻摩押的四境；哀号的声音达到以基莲；哀号的声音达到比珥以琳。
{Isa 15:9}  For the waters of Dibon are full of blood; for I will bring upon Dibon even more, a lion for those of Moab who escape, for the remnant of the land.
{Isa 15:9}  底们的水充满了血；我还要加增底们的灾难，叫狮子来追上摩押逃脱的民和那地上所余剩的人。
{Isa 16:1}  Send the lamb to the ruler of the land, from Sela, by way of the desert, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.
{Isa 16:1}  你们当将羊羔奉给那地掌权的，从西拉往旷野，送到锡安城（原文作女子）的山。
{Isa 16:2}  Like fleeing birds, like a scattered nest, so are the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon.
{Isa 16:2}  摩押的居民（原文作女子）在亚嫩渡口，必像游飞的鸟，如拆窝的雏。
{Isa 16:3}  "Give counsel; grant justice; make your shade like night at the height of noon; shelter the outcasts; do not reveal the fugitive;
{Isa 16:3}  求你献谋略，行公平，使你的影子在午间如黑夜，隐藏被赶散的人，不可显露逃民。
{Isa 16:4}  let the outcasts of Moab sojourn among you; be a shelter to them from the destroyer. When the oppressor is no more, and destruction has ceased, and he who tramples underfoot has vanished from the land,
{Isa 16:4}  求你容我这被赶散的人和你同居。至于摩押，求你作他的隐密处，脱离灭命者的面。勒索人的归于无有，毁灭的事止息了，欺压人的从国中除灭了，
{Isa 16:5}  then a throne will be established in steadfast love, and on it will sit in faithfulness in the tent of David one who judges and seeks justice and is swift to do righteousness."
{Isa 16:5}  必有宝座因慈爱坚立；必有一位诚诚实实坐在其上，在大卫帐幕中施行审判，寻求公平，速行公义。
{Isa 16:6}  We have heard of the pride of Moab-- how proud he is!-- of his arrogance, his pride, and his insolence; in his idle boasting he is not right.
{Isa 16:6}  我们听说摩押人骄傲，是极其骄傲；听说他狂妄、骄傲、忿怒；他夸大的话是虚空的。
{Isa 16:7}  Therefore let Moab wail for Moab, let everyone wail. Mourn, utterly stricken, for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth.
{Isa 16:7}  因此，摩押人必为摩押哀号；人人都要哀号。你们摩押人要为吉珥哈列设的葡萄饼哀叹，极其忧伤。
{Isa 16:8}  For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have struck down its branches, which reached to Jazer and strayed to the desert; its shoots spread abroad and passed over the sea.
{Isa 16:8}  因为希实本的田地和西比玛的葡萄树都衰残了。列国的君主折断其上美好的枝子；这枝子长到雅谢延到旷野，嫩枝向外探出，直探过盐海。
{Isa 16:9}  Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for over your summer fruit and your harvest the shout has ceased.
{Isa 16:9}  因此，我要为西比玛的葡萄树哀哭，与雅谢人哀哭一样。希实本、以利亚利啊，我要以眼泪浇灌你；因为有交战呐喊的声音临到你夏天的果子，并你收割的庄稼。
{Isa 16:10} And joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful field, and in the vineyards no songs are sung, no cheers are raised; no treader treads out wine in the presses; I have put an end to the shouting.
{Isa 16:10} 从肥美的田中夺去了欢喜快乐；在葡萄园里必无歌唱，也无欢呼的声音。踹酒的在酒榨中不得踹出酒来；我使他欢呼的声音止息。
{Isa 16:11} Therefore my inner parts moan like a lyre for Moab, and my inmost self for Kir-hareseth.
{Isa 16:11} 因此，我心腹为摩押哀鸣如琴；我心肠为吉珥哈列设也是如此。
{Isa 16:12} And when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, when he comes to his sanctuary to pray, he will not prevail.
{Isa 16:12} 摩押人朝见的时候，在高处疲乏，又到他圣所祈祷，也不蒙应允。
{Isa 16:13} This is the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab in the past.
{Isa 16:13} 这是耶和华从前论摩押的话。
{Isa 16:14} But now the LORD has spoken, saying, "In three years, like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt, in spite of all his great multitude, and those who remain will be very few and feeble."
{Isa 16:14} 但现在耶和华说：“三年之内，照雇工的年数，摩押的荣耀与他的群众必被藐视，余剩的人甚少无几。”
{Isa 17:1}  An oracle concerning Damascus. Behold, Damascus will cease to be a city and will become a heap of ruins.
{Isa 17:1}  论大马色的默示：看哪，大马色已被废弃，不再为城，必变作乱堆。
{Isa 17:2}  The cities of Aroer are deserted; they will be for flocks, which will lie down, and none will make them afraid.
{Isa 17:2}  亚罗珥的城邑已被撇弃，必成为牧羊之处；羊在那里躺卧，无人惊吓。
{Isa 17:3}  The fortress will disappear from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus; and the remnant of Syria will be like the glory of the children of Israel, declares the LORD of hosts.
{Isa 17:3}  以法莲不再有保障；大马色不再有国权；亚兰所剩下的必像以色列人的荣耀消灭一样。这是万军之耶和华说的。
{Isa 17:4}  And in that day the glory of Jacob will be brought low, and the fat of his flesh will grow lean.
{Isa 17:4}  到那日，雅各的荣耀必至枵薄；他肥胖的身体必渐瘦弱。
{Isa 17:5}  And it shall be as when the reaper gathers standing grain and his arm harvests the ears, and as when one gleans the ears of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
{Isa 17:5}  就必像收割的人收敛禾稼，用手割取穗子，又像人在利乏音谷拾取遗落的穗子。
{Isa 17:6}  Gleanings will be left in it, as when an olive tree is beaten-- two or three berries in the top of the highest bough, four or five on the branches of a fruit tree, declares the LORD God of Israel.
{Isa 17:6}  其间所剩下的不多，好像人打橄榄树，在尽上的枝梢上只剩两三个果子；在多果树的旁枝上只剩四五个果子。这是耶和华以色列的神说的。
{Isa 17:7}  In that day man will look to his Maker, and his eyes will look on the Holy One of Israel.
{Isa 17:7}  当那日，人必仰望造他们的主，眼目重看以色列的圣者。
{Isa 17:8}  He will not look to the altars, the work of his hands, and he will not look on what his own fingers have made, either the Asherim or the altars of incense.
{Isa 17:8}  他们必不仰望祭坛，就是自己手所筑的，也不重看自己指头所做的，无论是木偶是日像。
{Isa 17:9}  In that day their strong cities will be like the deserted places of the wooded heights and the hilltops, which they deserted because of the children of Israel, and there will be desolation.
{Isa 17:9}  在那日，他们的坚固城必像树林中和山顶上所撇弃的地方，就是从前在以色列人面前被人撇弃的。这样，地就荒凉了。
{Isa 17:10} For you have forgotten the God of your salvation and have not remembered the Rock of your refuge; therefore, though you plant pleasant plants and sow the vine-branch of a stranger,
{Isa 17:10} 因你忘记救你的神，不记念你能力的磐石；所以，你栽上佳美的树秧子，插上异样的栽子。
{Isa 17:11} though you make them grow on the day that you plant them, and make them blossom in the morning that you sow, yet the harvest will flee away in a day of grief and incurable pain.
{Isa 17:11} 栽种的日子，你周围圈上篱笆，又到早晨使你所种的开花；但在愁苦极其伤痛的日子，所收割的都飞去了。
{Isa 17:12} Ah, the thunder of many peoples; they thunder like the thundering of the sea! Ah, the roar of nations; they roar like the roaring of mighty waters!
{Isa 17:12} 唉！多民哄嚷，好像海浪砰訇；列邦奔腾，好像猛水滔滔；
{Isa 17:13} The nations roar like the roaring of many waters, but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far away, chased like chaff on the mountains before the wind and whirling dust before the storm.
{Isa 17:13} 列邦奔腾，好像多水滔滔；但神斥责他们，他们就远远逃避，又被追赶，如同山上的风前糠，又如暴风前的旋风土。
{Isa 17:14} At evening time, behold, terror! Before morning, they are no more! This is the portion of those who loot us, and the lot of those who plunder us.
{Isa 17:14} 到晚上有惊吓，未到早晨他们就没有了。这是掳掠我们之人所得的分，是抢夺我们之人的报应。
{Isa 18:1}  Ah, land of whirring wings that is beyond the rivers of Cush,
{Isa 18:1}  唉！古实河外翅膀刷刷响声之地，
{Isa 18:2}  which sends ambassadors by the sea, in vessels of papyrus on the waters! Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people feared near and far, a nation mighty and conquering, whose land the rivers divide.
{Isa 18:2}  差遣使者在水面上，坐蒲草船过海。先知说：你们快行的使者，要到高大光滑的民那里去。自从开国以来，那民极其可畏，是分地界践踏人的；他们的地有江河分开。
{Isa 18:3}  All you inhabitants of the world, you who dwell on the earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains, look! When a trumpet is blown, hear!
{Isa 18:3}  世上一切的居民和地上所住的人哪，山上竖立大旗的时候你们要看；吹角的时候你们要听。
{Isa 18:4}  For thus the LORD said to me: "I will quietly look from my dwelling like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."
{Isa 18:4}  耶和华对我这样说：我要安静，在我的居所观看，如同日光中的清热，又如露水的云雾在收割的热天。
{Isa 18:5}  For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he cuts off the shoots with pruning hooks, and the spreading branches he lops off and clears away.
{Isa 18:5}  收割之先，花开已谢，花也成了将熟的葡萄；他必用镰刀削去嫩枝，又砍掉蔓延的枝条，
{Isa 18:6}  They shall all of them be left to the birds of prey of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth. And the birds of prey will summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth will winter on them.
{Isa 18:6}  都要撇给山间的鸷鸟和地上的野兽。夏天，鸷鸟要宿在其上；冬天，野兽都卧在其中。
{Isa 18:7}  At that time tribute will be brought to the LORD of hosts from a people tall and smooth, from a people feared near and far, a nation mighty and conquering, whose land the rivers divide, to Mount Zion, the place of the name of the LORD of hosts.
{Isa 18:7}  到那时，这高大光滑的民，就是从开国以来极其可畏、分地界践踏人的，他们的地有江河分开；他们必将礼物奉给万军之耶和华，就是奉到锡安山耶和华安置他名的地方。
{Isa 19:1}  An oracle concerning Egypt. Behold, the LORD is riding on a swift cloud and comes to Egypt; and the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence, and the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them.
{Isa 19:1}  论埃及的默示：看哪，耶和华乘驾快云，临到埃及。埃及的偶像在他面前战兢；埃及人的心在里面消化。
{Isa 19:2}  And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians, and they will fight, each against another and each against his neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom;
{Isa 19:2}  我必激动埃及人攻击埃及人，弟兄攻击弟兄，邻舍攻击邻舍；这城攻击那城，这国攻击那国。
{Isa 19:3}  and the spirit of the Egyptians within them will be emptied out, and I will confound their counsel; and they will inquire of the idols and the sorcerers, and the mediums and the necromancers;
{Isa 19:3}  埃及人的心神必在里面耗尽；我必败坏他们的谋略。他们必求问偶像和念咒的、交鬼的、行巫术的。
{Isa 19:4}  and I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a hard master, and a fierce king will rule over them, declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
{Isa 19:4}  我必将埃及人交在残忍主的手中；强暴王必辖制他们。这是主万军之耶和华说的。
{Isa 19:5}  And the waters of the sea will be dried up, and the river will be dry and parched,
{Isa 19:5}  海中的水必绝尽，河也消没干涸。
{Isa 19:6}  and its canals will become foul, and the branches of Egypt's Nile will diminish and dry up, reeds and rushes will rot away.
{Isa 19:6}  江河要变臭；埃及的河水都必减少枯干。苇子和芦荻都必衰残；
{Isa 19:7}  There will be bare places by the Nile, on the brink of the Nile, and all that is sown by the Nile will be parched, will be driven away, and will be no more.
{Isa 19:7}  靠尼罗河旁的草田，并沿尼罗河所种的田，都必枯干。庄稼被风吹去，归于无有。
{Isa 19:8}  The fishermen will mourn and lament, all who cast a hook in the Nile; and they will languish who spread nets on the water.
{Isa 19:8}  打鱼的必哀哭。在尼罗河一切钓鱼的必悲伤；在水上撒网的必都衰弱。
{Isa 19:9}  The workers in combed flax will be in despair, and the weavers of white cotton.
{Isa 19:9}  用梳好的麻造物的和织白布的都必羞愧；
{Isa 19:10} Those who are the pillars of the land will be crushed, and all who work for pay will be grieved.
{Isa 19:10} 国柱必被打碎，所有佣工的，心必愁烦。
{Isa 19:11} The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the wisest counselors of Pharaoh give stupid counsel. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings"?
{Isa 19:11} 琐安的首领极其愚昧；法老大有智慧的谋士，所筹划的成为愚谋。你们怎敢对法老说：我是智慧人的子孙，我是古王的后裔？
{Isa 19:12} Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you that they might know what the LORD of hosts has purposed against Egypt.
{Isa 19:12} 你的智慧人在那里呢？万军之耶和华向埃及所定的旨意，他们可以知道，可以告诉你吧！
{Isa 19:13} The princes of Zoan have become fools, and the princes of Memphis are deluded; those who are the cornerstones of her tribes have made Egypt stagger.
{Isa 19:13} 琐安的首领都变为愚昧；挪弗的首领都受了迷惑。当埃及支派房角石的，使埃及人走错了路。
{Isa 19:14} The LORD has mingled within her a spirit of confusion, and they will make Egypt stagger in all its deeds, as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
{Isa 19:14} 耶和华使乖谬的灵搀入埃及中间；首领使埃及一切所做的都有差错，好像醉酒之人呕吐的时候东倒西歪一样。
{Isa 19:15} And there will be nothing for Egypt that head or tail, palm branch or reed, may do.
{Isa 19:15} 埃及中，无论是头与尾，棕枝与芦苇，所做之工都不成就。
{Isa 19:16} In that day the Egyptians will be like women, and tremble with fear before the hand that the LORD of hosts shakes over them.
{Isa 19:16} 到那日，埃及人必像妇人一样，他们必因万军之耶和华在埃及以上所抡的手，战兢惧怕。
{Isa 19:17} And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians. Everyone to whom it is mentioned will fear because of the purpose that the LORD of hosts has purposed against them.
{Isa 19:17} 犹大地必使埃及惊恐，向谁提起犹大地，谁就惧怕。这是因万军之耶和华向埃及所定的旨意。
{Isa 19:18} In that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD of hosts. One of these will be called the City of Destruction.
{Isa 19:18} 当那日，埃及地必有五城的人说迦南的方言，又指着万军之耶和华起誓。有一城必称为“灭亡城”。
{Isa 19:19} In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border.
{Isa 19:19} 当那日，在埃及地中必有为耶和华筑的一座坛；在埃及的边界上必有为耶和华立的一根柱。
{Isa 19:20} It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt. When they cry to the LORD because of oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and deliver them.
{Isa 19:20} 这都要在埃及地为万军之耶和华作记号和证据。埃及人因为受人的欺压哀求耶和华，他就差遣一位救主作护卫者，拯救他们。
{Isa 19:21} And the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day and worship with sacrifice and offering, and they will make vows to the LORD and perform them.
{Isa 19:21} 耶和华必被埃及人所认识。在那日，埃及人必认识耶和华，也要献祭物和供物敬拜他，并向耶和华许愿还愿。
{Isa 19:22} And the LORD will strike Egypt, striking and healing, and they will return to the LORD, and he will listen to their pleas for mercy and heal them.
{Isa 19:22} 耶和华必击打埃及，又击打又医治，埃及人就归向耶和华。他必应允他们的祷告，医治他们。
{Isa 19:23} In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
{Isa 19:23} 当那日，必有从埃及通亚述去的大道。亚述人要进入埃及，埃及人也进入亚述；埃及人要与亚述人一同敬拜耶和华。
{Isa 19:24} In that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth,
{Isa 19:24} 当那日，以色列必与埃及、亚述三国一律，使地上的人得福；
{Isa 19:25} whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying, "Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance."
{Isa 19:25} 因为万军之耶和华赐福给他们，说：“埃及我的百姓，亚述我手的工作，以色列我的产业，都有福了！”
{Isa 20:1}  In the year that the commander in chief, who was sent by Sargon the king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and fought against it and captured it--
{Isa 20:1}  亚述王撒珥根打发他珥探到亚实突的那年，他珥探就攻打亚实突，将城攻取。
{Isa 20:2}  at that time the LORD spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, "Go, and loose the sackcloth from your waist and take off your sandals from your feet," and he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
{Isa 20:2}  那时，耶和华晓谕亚摩斯的儿子以赛亚说：“你去解掉你腰间的麻布，脱下你脚上的鞋。”以赛亚就这样做，露身赤脚行走。
{Isa 20:3}  Then the LORD said, "As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Cush,
{Isa 20:3}  耶和华说：“我仆人以赛亚怎样露身赤脚行走三年，作为关乎埃及和古实的预兆奇迹。
{Isa 20:4}  so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptian captives and the Cushite exiles, both the young and the old, naked and barefoot, with buttocks uncovered, the nakedness of Egypt.
{Isa 20:4}  照样，亚述王也必掳去埃及人，掠去古实人，无论老少，都露身赤脚，现出下体，使埃及蒙羞。
{Isa 20:5}  Then they shall be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and of Egypt their boast.
{Isa 20:5}  以色列人必因所仰望的古实，所夸耀的埃及，惊惶羞愧。
{Isa 20:6}  And the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, 'Behold, this is what has happened to those in whom we hoped and to whom we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria! And we, how shall we escape?'"
{Isa 20:6}  “那时，这沿海一带的居民必说：‘看哪，我们素所仰望的，就是我们为脱离亚述王逃往求救的，不过是如此！我们怎能逃脱呢？’”
{Isa 21:1}  The oracle concerning the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the Negeb sweep on, it comes from the wilderness, from a terrible land.
{Isa 21:1}  论海旁旷野的默示：有仇敌从旷野，从可怕之地而来，好像南方的旋风，猛然扫过。
{Isa 21:2}  A stern vision is told to me; the traitor betrays, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam; lay siege, O Media; all the sighing she has caused I bring to an end.
{Isa 21:2}  令人凄惨的异象已默示于我。诡诈的行诡诈，毁灭的行毁灭。以拦哪，你要上去！玛代啊，你要围困！主说：我使一切叹息止住。
{Isa 21:3}  Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman in labor; I am bowed down so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see.
{Isa 21:3}  所以，我满腰疼痛；痛苦将我抓住，好像产难的妇人一样。我疼痛甚至不能听；我惊惶甚至不能看。
{Isa 21:4}  My heart staggers; horror has appalled me; the twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling.
{Isa 21:4}  我心慌张，惊恐威吓我。我所羡慕的黄昏，变为我的战兢。
{Isa 21:5}  They prepare the table, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink. Arise, O princes; oil the shield!
{Isa 21:5}  他们摆设筵席，派人守望，又吃又喝。首领啊，你们起来，用油抹盾牌。
{Isa 21:6}  For thus the Lord said to me: "Go, set a watchman; let him announce what he sees.
{Isa 21:6}  主对我如此说：你去设立守望的，使他将所看见的述说。
{Isa 21:7}  When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, let him listen diligently, very diligently."
{Isa 21:7}  他看见军队，就是骑马的一对一对的来，又看见驴队，骆驼队，就要侧耳细听。
{Isa 21:8}  Then he who saw cried out: "Upon a watchtower I stand, O Lord, continually by day, and at my post I am stationed whole nights.
{Isa 21:8}  他像狮子吼叫，说：主啊，我白日常站在望楼上，整夜立在我守望所。
{Isa 21:9}  And behold, here come riders, horsemen in pairs!" And he answered, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the carved images of her gods he has shattered to the ground."
{Isa 21:9}  看哪，有一队军兵骑着马，一对一对的来。他就说：巴比伦倾倒了！倾倒了！他一切雕刻的神像都打碎于地。
{Isa 21:10} O my threshed and winnowed one, what I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I announce to you.
{Isa 21:10} 我被打的禾稼，我场上的谷啊，我从万军之耶和华以色列的神那里所听见的，都告诉你们了。
{Isa 21:11} The oracle concerning Dumah. One is calling to me from Seir, "Watchman, what time of the night? Watchman, what time of the night?"
{Isa 21:11} 论度玛的默示：有人声从西珥呼问我说：守望的啊，夜里如何？守望的啊，夜里如何？
{Isa 21:12} The watchman says: "Morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire; come back again."
{Isa 21:12} 守望的说：早晨将到，黑夜也来。你们若要问就可以问，可以回头再来。

{Isa 21:14} To the thirsty bring water; meet the fugitive with bread, O inhabitants of the land of Tema.
{Isa 21:14} 提玛地的居民拿水来，送给口渴的，拿饼来迎接逃避的。
{Isa 21:15} For they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the press of battle.
{Isa 21:15} 因为他们逃避刀剑和出了鞘的刀，并上了弦的弓与刀兵的重灾。
{Isa 21:16} For thus the Lord said to me, "Within a year, according to the years of a hired worker, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end.
{Isa 21:16} 主对我这样说：“一年之内，照雇工的年数，基达的一切荣耀必归于无有。
{Isa 21:17} And the remainder of the archers of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar will be few, for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken."
{Isa 21:17} 弓箭手所余剩的，就是基达人的勇士，必然稀少，因为这是耶和华以色列的神说的。”
{Isa 22:1}  The oracle concerning the valley of vision. What do you mean that you have gone up, all of you, to the housetops,
{Isa 22:1}  论异象谷的默示：有什么事使你这满城的人都上房顶呢？
{Isa 22:2}  you who are full of shoutings, tumultuous city, exultant town? Your slain are not slain with the sword or dead in battle.
{Isa 22:2}  你这满处呐喊、大有喧哗的城，欢乐的邑啊，你中间被杀的并不是被刀杀，也不是因打仗死亡。
{Isa 22:3}  All your leaders have fled together; without the bow they were captured. All of you who were found were captured, though they had fled far away.
{Isa 22:3}  你所有的官长一同逃跑，都为弓箭手所捆绑。你中间一切被找到的都一同被捆绑；他们本是逃往远方的。
{Isa 22:4}  Therefore I said: "Look away from me; let me weep bitter tears; do not labor to comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people."
{Isa 22:4}  所以我说：你们转眼不看我，我要痛哭。不要因我众民（原文作民女）的毁灭，就竭力安慰我。
{Isa 22:5}  For the Lord GOD of hosts has a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the valley of vision, a battering down of walls and a shouting to the mountains.
{Isa 22:5}  因为主万军之耶和华使“异象谷”有溃乱、践踏、烦扰的日子。城被攻破，哀声达到山间。
{Isa 22:6}  And Elam bore the quiver with chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.
{Isa 22:6}  以拦带着箭袋，还有坐战车的和马兵；吉珥揭开盾牌。
{Isa 22:7}  Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen took their stand at the gates.
{Isa 22:7}  你嘉美的谷遍满战车，也有马兵在城门前排列。
{Isa 22:8}  He has taken away the covering of Judah. In that day you looked to the weapons of the House of the Forest,
{Isa 22:8}  他去掉犹大的遮盖。那日，你就仰望林库内的军器。
{Isa 22:9}  and you saw that the breaches of the city of David were many. You collected the waters of the lower pool,
{Isa 22:9}  你们看见大卫城的破口很多，便聚积下池的水，
{Isa 22:10} and you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.
{Isa 22:10} 又数点耶路撒冷的房屋，将房屋拆毁，修补城墙，
{Isa 22:11} You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to him who did it, or see him who planned it long ago.
{Isa 22:11} 又在两道城墙中间挖一个聚水池可盛旧池的水，却不仰望做这事的主，也不顾念从古定这事的。
{Isa 22:12} In that day the Lord GOD of hosts called for weeping and mourning, for baldness and wearing sackcloth;
{Isa 22:12} 当那日，主万军之耶和华叫人哭泣哀号，头上光秃，身披麻布。
{Isa 22:13} and behold, joy and gladness, killing oxen and slaughtering sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine. "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
{Isa 22:13} 谁知，人倒欢喜快乐，宰牛杀羊，吃肉喝酒，说：我们吃喝吧！因为明天要死了。
{Isa 22:14} The LORD of hosts has revealed himself in my ears: "Surely this iniquity will not be atoned for you until you die," says the Lord GOD of hosts.
{Isa 22:14} 万军之耶和华亲自默示我说：这罪孽直到你们死，断不得赦免！这是主万军之耶和华说的。
{Isa 22:15} Thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, "Come, go to this steward, to Shebna, who is over the household, and say to him:
{Isa 22:15} 主万军之耶和华这样说：“你去见掌银库的，就是家宰舍伯那，对他说：
{Isa 22:16} What have you to do here, and whom have you here, that you have cut out here a tomb for yourself, you who cut out a tomb on the height and carve a dwelling for yourself in the rock?
{Isa 22:16} ‘你在这里做什么呢？有什么人竟在这里凿坟墓，就是在高处为自己凿坟墓，在磐石中为自己凿出安身之所？
{Isa 22:17} Behold, the LORD will hurl you away violently, O you strong man. He will seize firm hold on you
{Isa 22:17} 看哪，耶和华必像大有力的人，将你紧紧缠裹，竭力抛去。
{Isa 22:18} and whirl you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a wide land. There you shall die, and there shall be your glorious chariots, you shame of your master's house.
{Isa 22:18} 他必将你滚成一团，抛在宽阔之地，好像抛球一样。你这主人家的羞辱，必在那里坐你荣耀的车，也必在那里死亡。
{Isa 22:19} I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your station.
{Isa 22:19} 我必赶逐你离开官职；你必从你的原位撤下。’
{Isa 22:20} In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
{Isa 22:20} “到那日，我必召我仆人希勒家的儿子以利亚敬来，
{Isa 22:21} and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
{Isa 22:21} 将你的外袍给他穿上，将你的腰带给他系紧，将你的政权交在他手中。他必作耶路撒冷居民和犹大家的父。
{Isa 22:22} And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David. He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
{Isa 22:22} 我必将大卫家的钥匙放在他肩头上。他开，无人能关；他关，无人能开。
{Isa 22:23} And I will fasten him like a peg in a secure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house.
{Isa 22:23} 我必将他安稳，像钉子钉在坚固处；他必作为他父家荣耀的宝座。
{Isa 22:24} And they will hang on him the whole honor of his father's house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons.
{Isa 22:24} 他父家所有的荣耀，连儿女带子孙，都挂在他身上，好像一切小器皿，从杯子到酒瓶挂上一样。
{Isa 22:25} In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, the peg that was fastened in a secure place will give way, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that was on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken."
{Isa 22:25} 万军之耶和华说：当那日，钉在坚固处的钉子必压斜，被砍断落地；挂在其上的重担必被剪断。因为这是耶和华说的。”
{Isa 23:1}  The oracle concerning Tyre. Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbor! From the land of Cyprus it is revealed to them.
{Isa 23:1}  论推罗的默示：他施的船只都要哀号；因为推罗变为荒场，甚至没有房屋，没有可进之路。这消息是从基提地得来的。
{Isa 23:2}  Be still, O inhabitants of the coast; the merchants of Sidon, who cross the sea, have filled you.
{Isa 23:2}  沿海的居民，就是素来靠航海西顿的商家得丰盛的，你们当静默无言。
{Isa 23:3}  And on many waters your revenue was the grain of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile; you were the merchant of the nations.
{Isa 23:3}  在大水之上，西曷的粮食、尼罗河的庄稼是推罗的进项；他作列国的大码头。
{Isa 23:4}  Be ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying: "I have neither labored nor given birth, I have neither reared young men nor brought up young women."
{Isa 23:4}  西顿哪，你当惭愧；因为大海说，就是海中的保障说：我没有劬劳，也没有生产，没有养育男子，也没有抚养童女。
{Isa 23:5}  When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish over the report about Tyre.
{Isa 23:5}  这风声传到埃及；埃及人为推罗的风声极其疼痛。
{Isa 23:6}  Cross over to Tarshish; wail, O inhabitants of the coast!
{Isa 23:6}  推罗人哪，你们当过到他施去；沿海的居民哪，你们都当哀号。
{Isa 23:7}  Is this your exultant city whose origin is from days of old, whose feet carried her to settle far away?
{Isa 23:7}  这是你们欢乐的城，从上古而有的吗？其中的居民往远方寄居。
{Isa 23:8}  Who has purposed this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth?
{Isa 23:8}  推罗本是赐冠冕的。他的商家是王子；他的买卖人是世上的尊贵人。遭遇如此是谁定的呢？
{Isa 23:9}  The LORD of hosts has purposed it, to defile the pompous pride of all glory, to dishonor all the honored of the earth.
{Isa 23:9}  是万军之耶和华所定的！为要污辱一切高傲的荣耀，使地上一切的尊贵人被藐视。
{Isa 23:10} Cross over your land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no restraint anymore.
{Isa 23:10} 他施的民（原文作女）哪，可以流行你的地，好像尼罗河；不再有腰带拘紧你。
{Isa 23:11} He has stretched out his hand over the sea; he has shaken the kingdoms; the LORD has given command concerning Canaan to destroy its strongholds.
{Isa 23:11} 耶和华已经向海伸手，震动列国。至于迦南，他已经吩咐拆毁其中的保障。
{Isa 23:12} And he said: "You will no more exult, O oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon; arise, cross over to Cyprus, even there you will have no rest."
{Isa 23:12} 他又说：受欺压西顿的居民（原文作处女）哪，你必不得再欢乐。起来！过到基提去；就是在那里也不得安歇。
{Isa 23:13} Behold the land of the Chaldeans! This is the people that was not; Assyria destined it for wild beasts. They erected their siege towers, they stripped her palaces bare, they made her a ruin.
{Isa 23:13} （看哪，迦勒底人之地向来没有这民，这国是亚述人为住旷野的人所立的。现在他们建筑戍楼，拆毁推罗的宫殿，使他成为荒凉。）
{Isa 23:14} Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste.
{Isa 23:14} 他施的船只都要哀号，因为你们的保障变为荒场。
{Isa 23:15} In that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:
{Isa 23:15} 到那时，推罗必被忘记七十年，照着一王的年日。七十年后，推罗的景况必像妓女所唱的歌：
{Isa 23:16} "Take a harp; go about the city, O forgotten prostitute! Make sweet melody; sing many songs, that you may be remembered."
{Isa 23:16} 你这被忘记的妓女啊，拿琴周流城内，巧弹多唱，使人再想念你。
{Isa 23:17} At the end of seventy years, the LORD will visit Tyre, and she will return to her wages and will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
{Isa 23:17} 七十年后，耶和华必眷顾推罗，他就仍得利息（原文作雇价；下同），与地上的万国交易（原文作行淫）。
{Isa 23:18} Her merchandise and her wages will be holy to the LORD. It will not be stored or hoarded, but her merchandise will supply abundant food and fine clothing for those who dwell before the LORD.
{Isa 23:18} 他的货财和利息要归耶和华为圣，必不积攒存留；因为他的货财必为住在耶和华面前的人所得，使他们吃饱，穿耐久的衣服。
{Isa 24:1}  Behold, the LORD will empty the earth and make it desolate, and he will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants.
{Isa 24:1}  看哪，耶和华使地空虚，变为荒凉；又翻转大地，将居民分散。
{Isa 24:2}  And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the slave, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.
{Isa 24:2}  那时百姓怎样，祭司也怎样；仆人怎样，主人也怎样；婢女怎样，主母也怎样；买物的怎样，卖物的也怎样；放债的怎样，借债的也怎样；取利的怎样，出利的也怎样。
{Isa 24:3}  The earth shall be utterly empty and utterly plundered; for the LORD has spoken this word.
{Isa 24:3}  地必全然空虚，尽都荒凉；因为这话是耶和华说的。
{Isa 24:4}  The earth mourns and withers; the world languishes and withers; the highest people of the earth languish.
{Isa 24:4}  地上悲哀衰残，世界败落衰残；地上居高位的人也败落了。
{Isa 24:5}  The earth lies defiled under its inhabitants; for they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.
{Isa 24:5}  地被其上的居民污秽；因为他们犯了律法，废了律例，背了永约。
{Isa 24:6}  Therefore a curse devours the earth, and its inhabitants suffer for their guilt; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are scorched, and few men are left.
{Isa 24:6}  所以，地被咒诅吞灭；住在其上的显为有罪。地上的居民被火焚烧，剩下的人稀少。
{Isa 24:7}  The wine mourns, the vine languishes, all the merry-hearted sigh.
{Isa 24:7}  新酒悲哀，葡萄树衰残；心中欢乐的俱都叹息。
{Isa 24:8}  The mirth of the tambourines is stilled, the noise of the jubilant has ceased, the mirth of the lyre is stilled.
{Isa 24:8}  击鼓之乐止息；宴乐人的声音完毕，弹琴之乐也止息了。
{Isa 24:9}  No more do they drink wine with singing; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
{Isa 24:9}  人必不得饮酒唱歌；喝浓酒的，必以为苦。
{Isa 24:10} The wasted city is broken down; every house is shut up so that none can enter.
{Isa 24:10} 荒凉的城拆毁了；各家关门闭户，使人都不得进去。
{Isa 24:11} There is an outcry in the streets for lack of wine; all joy has grown dark; the gladness of the earth is banished.
{Isa 24:11} 在街上因酒有悲叹的声音；一切喜乐变为昏暗；地上的欢乐归于无有。
{Isa 24:12} Desolation is left in the city; the gates are battered into ruins.
{Isa 24:12} 城中只有荒凉；城门拆毁净尽。
{Isa 24:13} For thus it shall be in the midst of the earth among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, as at the gleaning when the grape harvest is done.
{Isa 24:13} 在地上的万民中，必像打过的橄榄树，又像已摘的葡萄所剩无几。
{Isa 24:14} They lift up their voices, they sing for joy; over the majesty of the LORD they shout from the west.
{Isa 24:14} 这些人要高声欢呼；他们为耶和华的威严，从海那里扬起声来。
{Isa 24:15} Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD; in the coastlands of the sea, give glory to the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
{Isa 24:15} 因此，你们要在东方荣耀耶和华；在众海岛荣耀耶和华以色列神的名。
{Isa 24:16} From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise, of glory to the Righteous One. But I say, "I waste away, I waste away. Woe is me! For the traitors have betrayed, with betrayal the traitors have betrayed."
{Isa 24:16} 我们听见从地极有人歌唱，说：荣耀归于义人。我却说：我消灭了！我消灭了，我有祸了！诡诈的行诡诈；诡诈的大行诡诈。
{Isa 24:17} Terror and the pit and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!
{Isa 24:17} 地上的居民哪，恐惧、陷坑、网罗都临近你。
{Isa 24:18} He who flees at the sound of the terror shall fall into the pit, and he who climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For the windows of heaven are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.
{Isa 24:18} 躲避恐惧声音的必坠入陷坑；从陷坑上来的必被网罗缠住；因为天上的窗户都开了，地的根基也震动了。
{Isa 24:19} The earth is utterly broken, the earth is split apart, the earth is violently shaken.
{Isa 24:19} 地全然破坏，尽都崩裂，大大的震动了。
{Isa 24:20} The earth staggers like a drunken man; it sways like a hut; its transgression lies heavy upon it, and it falls, and will not rise again.
{Isa 24:20} 地要东倒西歪，好像醉酒的人；又摇来摇去，好像吊床。罪过在其上沉重，必然塌陷，不能复起。
{Isa 24:21} On that day the LORD will punish the host of heaven, in heaven, and the kings of the earth, on the earth.
{Isa 24:21} 到那日，耶和华在高处必惩罚高处的众军，在地上必惩罚地上的列王。
{Isa 24:22} They will be gathered together as prisoners in a pit; they will be shut up in a prison, and after many days they will be punished.
{Isa 24:22} 他们必被聚集，像囚犯被聚在牢狱中，并要囚在监牢里，多日之后便被讨罪（或作：眷顾）。
{Isa 24:23} Then the moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed, for the LORD of hosts reigns on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and his glory will be before his elders.
{Isa 24:23} 那时，月亮要蒙羞，日头要惭愧；因为万军之耶和华必在锡安山，在耶路撒冷作王；在敬畏他的长老面前，必有荣耀。
{Isa 25:1}  O LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you; I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, plans formed of old, faithful and sure.
{Isa 25:1}  耶和华啊，你是我的神；我要尊崇你，我要称赞你的名。因为你以忠信诚实行过奇妙的事，成就你古时所定的。
{Isa 25:2}  For you have made the city a heap, the fortified city a ruin; the foreigners' palace is a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.
{Isa 25:2}  你使城变为乱堆，使坚固城变为荒场，使外邦人宫殿的城不再为城，永远不再建造。
{Isa 25:3}  Therefore strong peoples will glorify you; cities of ruthless nations will fear you.
{Isa 25:3}  所以，刚强的民必荣耀你；强暴之国的城必敬畏你。
{Isa 25:4}  For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat; for the breath of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall,
{Isa 25:4}  因为当强暴人催逼人的时候，如同暴风直吹墙壁，你就作贫穷人的保障，作困乏人急难中的保障，作躲暴风之处，作避炎热的阴凉。
{Isa 25:5}  like heat in a dry place. You subdue the noise of the foreigners; as heat by the shade of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is put down.
{Isa 25:5}  你要压制外邦人的喧哗，好像干燥地的热气下落；禁止强暴人的凯歌，好像热气被云影消化。
{Isa 25:6}  On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wine, of rich food full of marrow, of aged wine well refined.
{Isa 25:6}  在这山上，万军之耶和华必为万民用肥甘设摆筵席，用陈酒和满髓的肥甘，并澄清的陈酒，设摆筵席。
{Isa 25:7}  And he will swallow up on this mountain the covering that is cast over all peoples, the veil that is spread over all nations.
{Isa 25:7}  他又必在这山上除灭遮盖万民之物和遮蔽万国蒙脸的帕子。
{Isa 25:8}  He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.
{Isa 25:8}  他已经吞灭死亡直到永远。主耶和华必擦去各人脸上的眼泪，又除掉普天下他百姓的羞辱，因为这是耶和华说的。
{Isa 25:9}  It will be said on that day, "Behold, this is our God; we have waited for him, that he might save us. This is the LORD; we have waited for him; let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation."
{Isa 25:9}  到那日，人必说：“看哪，这是我们的神；我们素来等候他，他必拯救我们。这是耶和华，我们素来等候他，我们必因他的救恩欢喜快乐。”
{Isa 25:10} For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, and Moab shall be trampled down in his place, as straw is trampled down in a dunghill.
{Isa 25:10} 耶和华的手必按在这山上；摩押人在所居之地必被践踏，好像干草被践踏在粪池的水中。
{Isa 25:11} And he will spread out his hands in the midst of it as a swimmer spreads his hands out to swim, but the LORD will lay low his pompous pride together with the skill of his hands.
{Isa 25:11} 他必在其中伸开手，好像洑水的伸开手洑水一样；但耶和华必使他的骄傲和他手所行的诡计一并败落。
{Isa 25:12} And the high fortifications of his walls he will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground, to the dust.
{Isa 25:12} 耶和华使你城上的坚固高台倾倒，拆平，直到尘埃。
{Isa 26:1}  In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; he sets up salvation as walls and bulwarks.
{Isa 26:1}  当那日，在犹大地人必唱这歌说：我们有坚固的城。耶和华要将救恩定为城墙，为外郭。
{Isa 26:2}  Open the gates, that the righteous nation that keeps faith may enter in.
{Isa 26:2}  敞开城门，使守信的义民得以进入。
{Isa 26:3}  You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.
{Isa 26:3}  坚心倚赖你的，你必保守他十分平安，因为他倚靠你。
{Isa 26:4}  Trust in the LORD forever, for the LORD GOD is an everlasting rock.
{Isa 26:4}  你们当倚靠耶和华直到永远，因为耶和华是永久的磐石。
{Isa 26:5}  For he has humbled the inhabitants of the height, the lofty city. He lays it low, lays it low to the ground, casts it to the dust.
{Isa 26:5}  他使住高处的与高城一并败落，将城拆毁，拆平，直到尘埃，
{Isa 26:6}  The foot tramples it, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy."
{Isa 26:6}  要被脚践踏，就是被困苦人的脚和穷乏人的脚践踏。
{Isa 26:7}  The path of the righteous is level; you make level the way of the righteous.
{Isa 26:7}  义人的道是正直的；你为正直的主，必修平义人的路。
{Isa 26:8}  In the path of your judgments, O LORD, we wait for you; your name and remembrance are the desire of our soul.
{Isa 26:8}  耶和华啊，我们在你行审判的路上等候你；我们心里所羡慕的是你的名，就是你那可记念的名。
{Isa 26:9}  My soul yearns for you in the night; my spirit within me earnestly seeks you. For when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
{Isa 26:9}  夜间，我心中羡慕你；我里面的灵切切寻求你。因为你在世上行审判的时候，地上的居民就学习公义。
{Isa 26:10} If favor is shown to the wicked, he does not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness he deals corruptly and does not see the majesty of the LORD.
{Isa 26:10} 以恩惠待恶人，他仍不学习公义；在正直的地上，他必行事不义，也不注意耶和华的威严。
{Isa 26:11} O LORD, your hand is lifted up, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people, and be ashamed. Let the fire for your adversaries consume them.
{Isa 26:11} 耶和华啊，你的手高举，他们仍然不看；却要看你为百姓发的热心，因而抱愧，并且有火烧灭你的敌人。
{Isa 26:12} O LORD, you will ordain peace for us, for you have indeed done for us all our works.
{Isa 26:12} 耶和华啊，你必派定我们得平安，因为我们所做的事都是你给我们成就的。
{Isa 26:13} O LORD our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone we bring to remembrance.
{Isa 26:13} 耶和华我们的神啊，在你以外曾有别的主管辖我们，但我们专要倚靠你，提你的名。
{Isa 26:14} They are dead, they will not live; they are shades, they will not arise; to that end you have visited them with destruction and wiped out all remembrance of them.
{Isa 26:14} 他们死了，必不能再活；他们去世，必不能再起；因为你刑罚他们，毁灭他们，他们的名号就全然消灭。
{Isa 26:15} But you have increased the nation, O LORD, you have increased the nation; you are glorified; you have enlarged all the borders of the land.
{Isa 26:15} 耶和华啊，你增添国民，你增添国民；你得了荣耀，又扩张地的四境。
{Isa 26:16} O LORD, in distress they sought you; they poured out a whispered prayer when your discipline was upon them.
{Isa 26:16} 耶和华啊，他们在急难中寻求你；你的惩罚临到他们身上，他们就倾心吐胆祷告你。
{Isa 26:17} Like a pregnant woman who writhes and cries out in her pangs when she is near to giving birth, so were we because of you, O LORD;
{Isa 26:17} 妇人怀孕，临产疼痛，在痛苦之中喊叫；耶和华啊，我们在你面前也是如此。
{Isa 26:18} we were pregnant, we writhed, but we have given birth to wind. We have accomplished no deliverance in the earth, and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.
{Isa 26:18} 我们也曾怀孕疼痛，所产的竟像风一样。我们在地上未曾行什么拯救的事；世上的居民也未曾败落。
{Isa 26:19} Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the dead.
{Isa 26:19} 死人（原文作你的死人）要复活，尸首（原文作我的尸首）要兴起。睡在尘埃的啊，要醒起歌唱！因你的甘露好像菜蔬上的甘露，地也要交出死人来。
{Isa 26:20} Come, my people, enter your chambers, and shut your doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until the fury has passed by.
{Isa 26:20} 我的百姓啊，你们要来进入内室，关上门，隐藏片时，等到忿怒过去。
{Isa 26:21} For behold, the LORD is coming out from his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, and the earth will disclose the blood shed on it, and will no more cover its slain.
{Isa 26:21} 因为耶和华从他的居所出来，要刑罚地上居民的罪孽。地也必露出其中的血，不再掩盖被杀的人。
{Isa 27:1}  In that day the LORD with his hard and great and strong sword will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting serpent, and he will slay the dragon that is in the sea.
{Isa 27:1}  到那日，耶和华必用他刚硬有力的大刀刑罚鳄鱼，就是那快行的蛇，刑罚鳄鱼，就是那曲行的蛇，并杀海中的大鱼。
{Isa 27:2}  In that day, "A pleasant vineyard, sing of it!
{Isa 27:2}  当那日，有出酒的葡萄园，你们要指这园唱歌说：
{Isa 27:3}  I, the LORD, am its keeper; every moment I water it. Lest anyone punish it, I keep it night and day;
{Isa 27:3}  我耶和华是看守葡萄园的；我必时刻浇灌，昼夜看守，免得有人损害。
{Isa 27:4}  I have no wrath. Would that I had thorns and briers to battle! I would march against them, I would burn them up together.
{Isa 27:4}  我心中不存忿怒。惟愿荆棘蒺藜与我交战，我就勇往直前，把他一同焚烧。
{Isa 27:5}  Or let them lay hold of my protection, let them make peace with me, let them make peace with me."
{Isa 27:5}  不然，让他持住我的能力，使他与我和好，愿他与我和好。
{Isa 27:6}  In days to come Jacob shall take root, Israel shall blossom and put forth shoots and fill the whole world with fruit.
{Isa 27:6}  将来雅各要扎根，以色列要发芽开花；他们的果实必充满世界。
{Isa 27:7}  Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or have they been slain as their slayers were slain?
{Isa 27:7}  主击打他们，岂像击打那些击打他们的人吗？他们被杀戮，岂像被他们所杀戮的吗？
{Isa 27:8}  Measure by measure, by exile you contended with them; he removed them with his fierce breath in the day of the east wind.
{Isa 27:8}  你打发他们去，是相机宜与他们相争；刮东风的日子，就用暴风将他们逐去。
{Isa 27:9}  Therefore by this the guilt of Jacob will be atoned for, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: when he makes all the stones of the altars like chalkstones crushed to pieces, no Asherim or incense altars will remain standing.
{Isa 27:9}  所以，雅各的罪孽得赦免，他的罪过得除掉的果效，全在乎此：就是他叫祭坛的石头变为打碎的灰石，以致木偶和日像不再立起。
{Isa 27:10} For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness; there the calf grazes; there it lies down and strips its branches.
{Isa 27:10} 因为坚固城变为凄凉，成了撇下离弃的居所，像旷野一样；牛犊必在那里吃草，在那里躺卧，并吃尽其中的树枝。
{Isa 27:11} When its boughs are dry, they are broken; women come and make a fire of them. For this is a people without discernment; therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them; he who formed them will show them no favor.
{Isa 27:11} 枝条枯干，必被折断；妇女要来点火烧着。因为这百姓蒙昧无知，所以，创造他们的必不怜恤他们；造成他们的也不施恩与他们。
{Isa 27:12} In that day from the river Euphrates to the Brook of Egypt the LORD will thresh out the grain, and you will be gleaned one by one, O people of Israel.
{Isa 27:12} 以色列人哪，到那日，耶和华必从大河，直到埃及小河，将你们一一的收集，如同人打树拾果一样。
{Isa 27:13} And in that day a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost in the land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
{Isa 27:13} 当那日，必大发角声，在亚述地将要灭亡的，并在埃及地被赶散的，都要来，他们就在耶路撒冷圣山上敬拜耶和华。
{Isa 28:1}  Ah, the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, and the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of the rich valley of those overcome with wine!
{Isa 28:1}  祸哉！以法莲的酒徒，住在肥美谷的山上，他们心里高傲，以所夸的为冠冕，犹如将残之花。
{Isa 28:2}  Behold, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong; like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, like a storm of mighty, overflowing waters, he casts down to the earth with his hand.
{Isa 28:2}  看哪，主有一大能大力者，像一阵冰雹，像毁灭的暴风，像涨溢的大水，他必用手将冠冕摔落于地。
{Isa 28:3}  The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden underfoot;
{Isa 28:3}  以法莲高傲的酒徒，他的冠冕必被踏在脚下。
{Isa 28:4}  and the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of the rich valley, will be like a first-ripe fig before the summer: when someone sees it, he swallows it as soon as it is in his hand.
{Isa 28:4}  那荣美将残之花，就是在肥美谷山上的，必像夏令以前初熟的无花果；看见这果的就注意，一到手中就吞吃了。
{Isa 28:5}  In that day the LORD of hosts will be a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people,
{Isa 28:5}  到那日，万军之耶和华必作他余剩之民的荣冠华冕，
{Isa 28:6}  and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
{Isa 28:6}  也作了在位上行审判者公平之灵，并城门口打退仇敌者的力量。
{Isa 28:7}  These also reel with wine and stagger with strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are swallowed by wine, they stagger with strong drink, they reel in vision, they stumble in giving judgment.
{Isa 28:7}  就是这地的人也因酒摇摇晃晃，因浓酒东倒西歪。祭司和先知因浓酒摇摇晃晃，被酒所困，因浓酒东倒西歪。他们错解默示，谬行审判。
{Isa 28:8}  For all tables are full of filthy vomit, with no space left.
{Isa 28:8}  因为各席上满了呕吐的污秽，无一处干净。
{Isa 28:9}  "To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, those taken from the breast?
{Isa 28:9}  讥诮先知的说：他要将知识指教谁呢？要使谁明白传言呢？是那刚断奶离怀的吗？
{Isa 28:10} For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little."
{Isa 28:10} 他竟命上加命，令上加令，律上加律，例上加例，这里一点，那里一点。
{Isa 28:11} For by people of strange lips and with a foreign tongue the LORD will speak to this people,
{Isa 28:11} 先知说：不然，主要藉异邦人的嘴唇和外邦人的舌头对这百姓说话。
{Isa 28:12} to whom he has said, "This is rest; give rest to the weary; and this is repose"; yet they would not hear.
{Isa 28:12} 他曾对他们说：你们要使疲乏人得安息，这样才得安息，才得舒畅，他们却不肯听。
{Isa 28:13} And the word of the LORD will be to them precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little, that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
{Isa 28:13} 所以，耶和华向他们说的话是命上加命，令上加令，律上加律，例上加例，这里一点，那里一点，以致他们前行仰面跌倒，而且跌碎，并陷入网罗被缠住。
{Isa 28:14} Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers, who rule this people in Jerusalem!
{Isa 28:14} 所以，你们这些亵慢的人，就是辖管住在耶路撒冷这百姓的，要听耶和华的话。
{Isa 28:15} Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol we have an agreement, when the overwhelming whip passes through it will not come to us, for we have made lies our refuge, and in falsehood we have taken shelter";
{Isa 28:15} 你们曾说：我们与死亡立约，与阴间结盟；敌军（原文作鞭子）如水涨漫经过的时候，必不临到我们；因我们以谎言为避所，在虚假以下藏身。
{Isa 28:16} therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am the one who has laid as a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation: 'Whoever believes will not be in haste.'
{Isa 28:16} 所以，主耶和华如此说：看哪，我在锡安放一块石头作为根基，是试验过的石头，是稳固根基，宝贵的房角石；信靠的人必不着急。
{Isa 28:17} And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plumb line; and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and waters will overwhelm the shelter."
{Isa 28:17} 我必以公平为准绳，以公义为线铊。冰雹必冲去谎言的避所；大水必漫过藏身之处。
{Isa 28:18} Then your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; when the overwhelming scourge passes through, you will be beaten down by it.
{Isa 28:18} 你们与死亡所立的约必然废掉，与阴间所结的盟必立不住。敌军（原文作鞭子）如水涨漫经过的时候，你们必被他践踏；
{Isa 28:19} As often as it passes through it will take you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.
{Isa 28:19} 每逢经过必将你们掳去。因为每早晨他必经过，白昼黑夜都必如此。明白传言的必受惊恐。
{Isa 28:20} For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on, and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in.
{Isa 28:20} 原来，床榻短，使人不能舒身；被窝窄，使人不能遮体。
{Isa 28:21} For the LORD will rise up as on Mount Perazim; as in the Valley of Gibeon he will be roused; to do his deed--strange is his deed! and to work his work--alien is his work!
{Isa 28:21} 耶和华必兴起，像在毗拉心山；他必发怒，像在基遍谷，好做成他的工，就是非常的工；成就他的事，就是奇异的事。
{Isa 28:22} Now therefore do not scoff, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord GOD of hosts against the whole land.
{Isa 28:22} 现在你们不可亵慢，恐怕捆你们的绑索更结实了；因为我从主万军之耶和华那里听见，已经决定在全地上施行灭绝的事。
{Isa 28:23} Give ear, and hear my voice; give attention, and hear my speech.
{Isa 28:23} 你们当侧耳听我的声音，留心听我的言语。
{Isa 28:24} Does he who plows for sowing plow continually? Does he continually open and harrow his ground?
{Isa 28:24} 那耕地为要撒种的，岂是常常耕地呢？岂是常常开垦耙地呢？
{Isa 28:25} When he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter dill, sow cumin, and put in wheat in rows and barley in its proper place, and emmer as the border?
{Isa 28:25} 他拉平了地面，岂不就撒种小茴香，播种大茴香，按行列种小麦，在定处种大麦，在田边种粗麦呢？
{Isa 28:26} For he is rightly instructed; his God teaches him.
{Isa 28:26} 因为他的神教导他务农相宜，并且指教他。
{Isa 28:27} Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is a cart wheel rolled over cumin, but dill is beaten out with a stick, and cumin with a rod.
{Isa 28:27} 原来打小茴香，不用尖利的器具，轧大茴香，也不用碌碡（原文作车轮；下同）；但用杖打小茴香，用棍打大茴香。
{Isa 28:28} Does one crush grain for bread? No, he does not thresh it forever; when he drives his cart wheel over it with his horses, he does not crush it.
{Isa 28:28} 做饼的粮食是用磨磨碎，因他不必常打；虽用碌碡和马打散，却不磨他。
{Isa 28:29} This also comes from the LORD of hosts; he is wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom.
{Isa 28:29} 这也是出于万军之耶和华他的谋略奇妙；他的智慧广大。
{Isa 29:1}  Ah, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts run their round.
{Isa 29:1}  唉！亚利伊勒，亚利伊勒，大卫安营的城，任凭你年上加年，节期照常周流。
{Isa 29:2}  Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be moaning and lamentation, and she shall be to me like an Ariel.
{Isa 29:2}  我终必使亚利伊勒困难；他必悲伤哀号，我却仍以他为亚利伊勒。
{Isa 29:3}  And I will encamp against you all around, and will besiege you with towers and I will raise siegeworks against you.
{Isa 29:3}  我必四围安营攻击你，屯兵围困你，筑垒攻击你。
{Isa 29:4}  And you will be brought low; from the earth you shall speak, and from the dust your speech will be bowed down; your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost, and from the dust your speech shall whisper.
{Isa 29:4}  你必败落，从地中说话；你的言语必微细出于尘埃。你的声音必像那交鬼者的声音出于地；你的言语低低微微出于尘埃。
{Isa 29:5}  But the multitude of your foreign foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the ruthless like passing chaff. And in an instant, suddenly,
{Isa 29:5}  你仇敌的群众，却要像细尘；强暴人的群众，也要像飞糠。这事必顷刻之间忽然临到。
{Isa 29:6}  you will be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
{Isa 29:6}  万军之耶和华必用雷轰、地震、大声、旋风、暴风，并吞灭的火焰，向他讨罪。
{Isa 29:7}  And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, all that fight against her and her stronghold and distress her, shall be like a dream, a vision of the night.
{Isa 29:7}  那时，攻击亚利伊勒列国的群众，就是一切攻击亚利伊勒和他的保障，并使他困难的，必如梦景，如夜间的异象；
{Isa 29:8}  As when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he is eating and awakes with his hunger not satisfied, or as when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he is drinking and awakes faint, with his thirst not quenched, so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.
{Isa 29:8}  又必像饥饿的人梦中吃饭，醒了仍觉腹空；或像口渴的人梦中喝水，醒了仍觉发昏，心里想喝。攻击锡安山列国的群众也必如此。
{Isa 29:9}  Astonish yourselves and be astonished; blind yourselves and be blind! Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with strong drink!
{Isa 29:9}  你们等候惊奇吧！你们宴乐昏迷吧！他们醉了，却非因酒；他们东倒西歪，却非因浓酒。
{Isa 29:10} For the LORD has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes (the prophets), and covered your heads (the seers).
{Isa 29:10} 因为耶和华将沉睡的灵浇灌你们，封闭你们的眼，蒙盖你们的头。你们的眼就是先知；你们的头就是先见。
{Isa 29:11} And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, "Read this," he says, "I cannot, for it is sealed."
{Isa 29:11} 所有的默示，你们看如封住的书卷，人将这书卷交给识字的，说：“请念吧！”他说：“我不能念，因为是封住了。”
{Isa 29:12} And when they give the book to one who cannot read, saying, "Read this," he says, "I cannot read."
{Isa 29:12} 又将这书卷交给不识字的人，说：“请念吧！”他说：“我不识字。”
{Isa 29:13} And the Lord said: "Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men,
{Isa 29:13} 主说：因为这百姓亲近我，用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我；他们敬畏我，不过是领受人的吩咐。
{Isa 29:14} therefore, behold, I will again do wonderful things with this people, with wonder upon wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hidden."
{Isa 29:14} 所以，我在这百姓中要行奇妙的事，就是奇妙又奇妙的事。他们智慧人的智慧必然消灭，聪明人的聪明必然隐藏。
{Isa 29:15} Ah, you who hide deep from the LORD your counsel, whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, "Who sees us? Who knows us?"
{Isa 29:15} 祸哉！那些向耶和华深藏谋略的，又在暗中行事，说：谁看见我们呢？谁知道我们呢？
{Isa 29:16} You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay, that the thing made should say of its maker, "He did not make me"; or the thing formed say of him who formed it, "He has no understanding"?
{Isa 29:16} 你们把事颠倒了，岂可看窑匠如泥吗？被制作的物岂可论制作物的说：他没有制作我？或是被创造的物论造物的说：他没有聪明？
{Isa 29:17} Is it not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest?
{Isa 29:17} 利巴嫩变为肥田，肥田看如树林，不是只有一点点时候吗？
{Isa 29:18} In that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.
{Isa 29:18} 那时，聋子必听见这书上的话；瞎子的眼必从迷蒙黑暗中得以看见。
{Isa 29:19} The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD, and the poor among mankind shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.
{Isa 29:19} 谦卑人必因耶和华增添欢喜；人间贫穷的必因以色列的圣者快乐。
{Isa 29:20} For the ruthless shall come to nothing and the scoffer cease, and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off,
{Isa 29:20} 因为，强暴人已归无有，亵慢人已经灭绝，一切找机会作孽的都被剪除。
{Isa 29:21} who by a word make a man out to be an offender, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and with an empty plea turn aside him who is in the right.
{Isa 29:21} 他们在争讼的事上定无罪的为有罪，为城门口责备人的设下网罗，用虚无的事屈枉义人。
{Isa 29:22} Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: "Jacob shall no more be ashamed, no more shall his face grow pale.
{Isa 29:22} 所以，救赎亚伯拉罕的耶和华论雅各家如此说：雅各必不再羞愧，面容也不至变色。
{Isa 29:23} For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will sanctify my name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
{Isa 29:23} 但他看见他的众子，就是我手的工作在他那里，他们必尊我的名为圣，必尊雅各的圣者为圣，必敬畏以色列的神。
{Isa 29:24} And those who go astray in spirit will come to understanding, and those who murmur will accept instruction."
{Isa 29:24} 心中迷糊的必得明白；发怨言的必受训诲。
{Isa 30:1}  "Ah, stubborn children," declares the LORD, "who carry out a plan, but not mine, and who make an alliance, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin;
{Isa 30:1}  耶和华说：祸哉！这悖逆的儿女。他们同谋，却不由于我，结盟，却不由于我的灵，以致罪上加罪；
{Isa 30:2}  who set out to go down to Egypt, without asking for my direction, to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
{Isa 30:2}  起身下埃及去，并没有求问我；要靠法老的力量加添自己的力量，并投在埃及的荫下。
{Isa 30:3}  Therefore shall the protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame, and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your humiliation.
{Isa 30:3}  所以，法老的力量必作你们的羞辱；投在埃及的荫下，要为你们的惭愧。
{Isa 30:4}  For though his officials are at Zoan and his envoys reach Hanes,
{Isa 30:4}  他们的首领已在琐安；他们的使臣到了哈内斯。
{Isa 30:5}  everyone comes to shame through a people that cannot profit them, that brings neither help nor profit, but shame and disgrace."
{Isa 30:5}  他们必因那不利于他们的民蒙羞。那民并非帮助，也非利益，只作羞耻凌辱。
{Isa 30:6}  An oracle on the beasts of the Negeb. Through a land of trouble and anguish, from where come the lioness and the lion, the adder and the flying fiery serpent, they carry their riches on the backs of donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people that cannot profit them.
{Isa 30:6}  论南方牲畜的默示：他们把财物驮在驴驹的脊背上，将宝物驮在骆驼的肉鞍上，经过艰难困苦之地，就是公狮、母狮、蝮蛇、火焰的飞龙之地，往那不利于他们的民那里去。
{Isa 30:7}  Egypt's help is worthless and empty; therefore I have called her "Rahab who sits still."
{Isa 30:7}  埃及的帮助是徒然无益的；所以我称他为“坐而不动的拉哈伯”。
{Isa 30:8}  And now, go, write it before them on a tablet and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come as a witness forever.
{Isa 30:8}  现今你去，在他们面前将这话刻在版上，写在书上，以便传留后世，直到永永远远。
{Isa 30:9}  For they are a rebellious people, lying children, children unwilling to hear the instruction of the LORD;
{Isa 30:9}  因为他们是悖逆的百姓、说谎的儿女，不肯听从耶和华训诲的儿女。
{Isa 30:10} who say to the seers, "Do not see," and to the prophets, "Do not prophesy to us what is right; speak to us smooth things, prophesy illusions,
{Isa 30:10} 他们对先见说：不要望见不吉利的事，对先知说：不要向我们讲正直的话；要向我们说柔和的话，言虚幻的事。
{Isa 30:11} leave the way, turn aside from the path, let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel."
{Isa 30:11} 你们要离弃正道，偏离直路，不要在我们面前再提说以色列的圣者。
{Isa 30:12} Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, "Because you despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and rely on them,
{Isa 30:12} 所以，以色列的圣者如此说：因为你们藐视这训诲的话，倚赖欺压和乖僻，以此为可靠的，
{Isa 30:13} therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach in a high wall, bulging out, and about to collapse, whose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant;
{Isa 30:13} 故此，这罪孽在你们身上，好像将要破裂凸出来的高墙，顷刻之间忽然坍塌；
{Isa 30:14} and its breaking is like that of a potter's vessel that is smashed so ruthlessly that among its fragments not a shard is found with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern."
{Isa 30:14} 要被打碎，好像把窑匠的瓦器打碎，毫不顾惜，甚至碎块中找不到一片可用以从炉内取火，从池中舀水。
{Isa 30:15} For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, "In returning and rest you shall be saved; in quietness and in trust shall be your strength." But you were unwilling,
{Isa 30:15} 主耶和华以色列的圣者曾如此说：你们得救在乎归回安息；你们得力在乎平静安稳；你们竟自不肯。
{Isa 30:16} and you said, "No! We will flee upon horses"; therefore you shall flee away; and, "We will ride upon swift steeds"; therefore your pursuers shall be swift.
{Isa 30:16} 你们却说：不然，我们要骑马奔走。所以你们必然奔走；又说：我们要骑飞快的牲口。所以追赶你们的，也必飞快。
{Isa 30:17} A thousand shall flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you shall flee, till you are left like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain, like a signal on a hill.
{Isa 30:17} 一人叱喝，必令千人逃跑；五人叱喝，你们都必逃跑；以致剩下的，好像山顶的旗杆，冈上的大旗。
{Isa 30:18} Therefore the LORD waits to be gracious to you, and therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you. For the LORD is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him.

{Isa 31:4}  For thus the LORD said to me, "As a lion or a young lion growls over his prey, and when a band of shepherds is called out against him he is not terrified by their shouting or daunted at their noise, so the LORD of hosts will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill.
{Isa 31:4}  耶和华对我如此说：狮子和少壮狮子护食咆哮，就是喊许多牧人来攻击他，他总不因他们的声音惊惶，也不因他们的喧哗缩伏。如此，万军之耶和华也必降临在锡安山冈上争战。

{Isa 32:5}  The fool will no more be called noble, nor the scoundrel said to be honorable.
{Isa 32:5}  愚顽人不再称为高明；吝啬人不再称为大方。
{Isa 32:6}  For the fool speaks folly, and his heart is busy with iniquity, to practice ungodliness, to utter error concerning the LORD, to leave the craving of the hungry unsatisfied, and to deprive the thirsty of drink.
{Isa 32:6}  因为愚顽人必说愚顽话，心里想作罪孽，惯行亵渎的事，说错谬的话攻击耶和华，使饥饿的人无食可吃，使口渴的人无水可喝。
{Isa 32:7}  As for the scoundrel--his devices are evil; he plans wicked schemes to ruin the poor with lying words, even when the plea of the needy is right.
{Isa 32:7}  吝啬人所用的法子是恶的；他图谋恶计，用谎言毁灭谦卑人；穷乏人讲公理的时候，他也是这样行。

{Isa 32:10} In little more than a year you will shudder, you complacent women; for the grape harvest fails, the fruit harvest will not come.

{Isa 33:13} 你们远方的人当听我所行的；你们近处的人当承认我的大能。
{Isa 33:14} The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless: "Who among us can dwell with the consuming fire? Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?"
{Isa 33:14} 锡安中的罪人都惧怕；不敬虔的人被战兢抓住。我们中间谁能与吞灭的火同住？我们中间谁能与永火同住呢？

{Isa 35:9}  在那里必没有狮子，猛兽也不登这路；在那里都遇不见，只有赎民在那里行走。
{Isa 35:10} And the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
{Isa 35:10} 并且耶和华救赎的民必归回，歌唱来到锡安；永乐必归到他们的头上；他们必得着欢喜快乐，忧愁叹息尽都逃避。
{Isa 36:1}  In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.
{Isa 36:1}  希西家王十四年，亚述王西拿基立上来攻击犹大的一切坚固城，将城攻取。
{Isa 36:2}  And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem, with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer's Field.
{Isa 36:2}  亚述王从拉吉差遣拉伯沙基率领大军往耶路撒冷，到希西家王那里去。他就站在上池的水沟旁，在漂布地的大路上。
{Isa 36:3}  And there came out to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.
{Isa 36:3}  于是希勒家的儿子家宰以利亚敬，并书记舍伯那和亚萨的儿子史官约亚，出来见拉伯沙基。
{Isa 36:4}  And the Rabshakeh said to them, "Say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours?
{Isa 36:4}  拉伯沙基对他们说：“你们去告诉希西家说，亚述大王如此说：‘你所倚靠的有什么可仗赖的呢？
{Isa 36:5}  Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? In whom do you now trust, that you have rebelled against me?
{Isa 36:5}  你说，有打仗的计谋和能力，我看不过是虚话。你到底倚靠谁才背叛我呢？
{Isa 36:6}  Behold, you are trusting in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
{Isa 36:6}  看哪，你所倚靠的埃及是那压伤的苇杖，人若靠这杖，就必刺透他的手。埃及王法老向一切倚靠他的人也是这样。
{Isa 36:7}  But if you say to me, "We trust in the LORD our God," is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, "You shall worship before this altar"?
{Isa 36:7}  你若对我说：我们倚靠耶和华我们的神。希西家岂不是将神的邱坛和祭坛废去，且对犹大和耶路撒冷的人说：你们当在这坛前敬拜吗？
{Isa 36:8}  Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
{Isa 36:8}  现在你把当头给我主亚述王，我给你二千匹马，看你这一面骑马的人够不够。
{Isa 36:9}  How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's servants, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
{Isa 36:9}  若不然，怎能打败我主臣仆中最小的军长呢？你竟倚靠埃及的战车马兵吗？
{Isa 36:10} Moreover, is it without the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.'"
{Isa 36:10} 现在我上来攻击毁灭这地，岂没有耶和华的意思吗？耶和华吩咐我说，你上去攻击毁灭这地吧！’”
{Isa 36:11} Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
{Isa 36:11} 以利亚敬、舍伯那、约亚对拉伯沙基说：“求你用亚兰言语和仆人说话，因为我们懂得；不要用犹大言语和我们说话，达到城上百姓的耳中。”
{Isa 36:12} But the Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?"
{Isa 36:12} 拉伯沙基说：“我主差遣我来，岂是单对你和你的主说这些话吗？不也是对这些坐在城上、要与你们一同吃自己粪喝自己尿的人说吗？”
{Isa 36:13} Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
{Isa 36:13} 于是，拉伯沙基站着，用犹大言语大声喊着说：“你们当听亚述大王的话。
{Isa 36:14} Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.
{Isa 36:14} 王如此说：‘你们不要被希西家欺哄了，因他不能拯救你们。
{Isa 36:15} Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD by saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
{Isa 36:15} 也不要听希西家使你们倚靠耶和华说：耶和华必要拯救我们，这城必不交在亚述王的手中。
{Isa 36:16} Do not listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern,
{Isa 36:16} 不要听希西家的话，因亚述王如此说：你们要与我和好。出来投降我，各人就可以吃自己葡萄树和无花果树的果子，喝自己井里的水。
{Isa 36:17} until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
{Isa 36:17} 等我来领你们到一个地方，与你们本地一样，就是有五谷和新酒之地，有粮食和葡萄园之地。
{Isa 36:18} Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, "The LORD will deliver us." Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
{Isa 36:18} 你们要谨防，恐怕希西家劝导你们说：耶和华必拯救我们。列国的神有那一个救他本国脱离亚述王的手呢？
{Isa 36:19} Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
{Isa 36:19} 哈马和亚珥拔的神在那里呢？西法瓦音的神在那里呢？他们曾救撒玛利亚脱离我的手吗？
{Isa 36:20} Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"
{Isa 36:20} 这些国的神有谁曾救自己的国脱离我的手呢？难道耶和华能救耶路撒冷脱离我的手吗？’”
{Isa 36:21} But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."
{Isa 36:21} 百姓静默不言，并不回答一句，因为王曾吩咐说：“不要回答他。”
{Isa 36:22} Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.
{Isa 36:22} 当下希勒家的儿子家宰以利亚敬和书记舍伯那，并亚萨的儿子史官约亚，都撕裂衣服，来到希西家那里，将拉伯沙基的话告诉了他。
{Isa 37:1}  As soon as King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the LORD.
{Isa 37:1}  希西家王听见就撕裂衣服，披上麻布，进了耶和华的殿，
{Isa 37:2}  And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz.
{Isa 37:2}  使家宰以利亚敬和书记舍伯那，并祭司中的长老，都披上麻布，去见亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚，
{Isa 37:3}  They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.
{Isa 37:3}  对他说：“希西家如此说：‘今日是急难、责罚、凌辱的日子，就如妇人将要生产婴孩，却没有力量生产。
{Isa 37:4}  It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.'"
{Isa 37:4}  或者耶和华你的神听见拉伯沙基的话，就是他主人亚述王打发他来辱骂永生神的话；耶和华你的神听见这话就发斥责。故此，求你为余剩的民扬声祷告。’”
{Isa 37:5}  When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,
{Isa 37:5}  希西家王的臣仆就去见以赛亚。
{Isa 37:6}  Isaiah said to them, "Say to your master, 'Thus says the LORD: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the young men of the king of Assyria have reviled me.
{Isa 37:6}  以赛亚对他们说：“要这样对你们的主人说，耶和华如此说：‘你听见亚述王的仆人亵渎我的话，不要惧怕。
{Isa 37:7}  Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.'"
{Isa 37:7}  我必惊动（原文作使灵进入）他的心；他要听见风声就归回本地，我必使他在那里倒在刀下。’”
{Isa 37:8}  The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
{Isa 37:8}  拉伯沙基回去，正遇见亚述王攻打立拿；原来他早听见亚述王拔营离开拉吉。
{Isa 37:9}  Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, "He has set out to fight against you." And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
{Isa 37:9}  亚述王听见人论古实王特哈加说：“他出来要与你争战。”亚述王一听见，就打发使者去见希西家，吩咐他们说：
{Isa 37:10} "Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
{Isa 37:10} “你们对犹大王希西家如此说：‘不要听你所倚靠的神欺哄你说：耶路撒冷必不交在亚述王的手中。
{Isa 37:11} Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, devoting them to destruction. And shall you be delivered?
{Isa 37:11} 你总听说亚述诸王向列国所行的乃是尽行灭绝，难道你还能得救吗？
{Isa 37:12} Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?
{Isa 37:12} 我列祖所毁灭的，就是歌散、哈兰、利色，和属提拉撒的伊甸人；这些国的神何曾拯救这些国呢？
{Isa 37:13} Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?'"
{Isa 37:13} 哈马的王，亚珥拔的王，西法瓦音城的王，希拿和以瓦的王，都在那里呢？’”
{Isa 37:14} Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
{Isa 37:14} 希西家从使者手里接过书信来，看完了，就上耶和华的殿，将书信在耶和华面前展开。
{Isa 37:15} And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
{Isa 37:15} 希西家向耶和华祷告说：
{Isa 37:16} "O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
{Isa 37:16} “坐在二基路伯上万军之耶和华以色列的神啊，你惟有你是天下万国的神，你曾创造天地。
{Isa 37:17} Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.
{Isa 37:17} 耶和华啊，求你侧耳而听；耶和华啊，求你睁眼而看，要听西拿基立的一切话，他是打发使者来辱骂永生神的。
{Isa 37:18} Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,
{Isa 37:18} 耶和华啊，亚述诸王果然使列国和列国之地变为荒凉，
{Isa 37:19} and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed.
{Isa 37:19} 将列国的神像都扔在火里；因为他本不是神，乃是人手所造的，是木头、石头的，所以灭绝他。
{Isa 37:20} So now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the LORD."
{Isa 37:20} 耶和华我们的神啊，现在求你救我们脱离亚述王的手，使天下万国都知道惟有你是耶和华。”
{Isa 37:21} Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
{Isa 37:21} 亚摩斯的儿子以赛亚就打发人去见希西家，说：“耶和华以色列的神如此说，你既然求我攻击亚述王西拿基立，
{Isa 37:22} this is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him: "'She despises you, she scorns you-- the virgin daughter of Zion; she wags her head behind you-- the daughter of Jerusalem.
{Isa 37:22} 所以耶和华论他这样说：锡安的处女藐视你，嗤笑你；耶路撒冷的女子向你摇头。
{Isa 37:23} "'Whom have you mocked and reviled? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes to the heights? Against the Holy One of Israel!
{Isa 37:23} 你辱骂谁，亵渎谁？扬起声来，高举眼目攻击谁呢？乃是攻击以色列的圣者。
{Isa 37:24} By your servants you have mocked the Lord, and you have said, With my many chariots I have gone up the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon, to cut down its tallest cedars, its choicest cypresses, to come to its remotest height, its most fruitful forest.
{Isa 37:24} 你藉你的臣仆辱骂主说：我率领许多战车上山顶，到利巴嫩极深之处；我要砍伐其中高大的香柏树和佳美的松树。我必上极高之处，进入肥田的树林。
{Isa 37:25} I dug wells and drank waters, to dry up with the sole of my foot all the streams of Egypt.
{Isa 37:25} 我已经挖井喝水；我必用脚掌踏干埃及的一切河。
{Isa 37:26} "'Have you not heard that I determined it long ago? I planned from days of old what now I bring to pass, that you should make fortified cities crash into heaps of ruins,
{Isa 37:26} 耶和华说：你岂没有听见我早先所做的、古时所立的吗？现在藉你使坚固城荒废，变为乱堆。
{Isa 37:27} while their inhabitants, shorn of strength, are dismayed and confounded, and have become like plants of the field and like tender grass, like grass on the housetops, blighted before it is grown.
{Isa 37:27} 所以其中的居民力量甚小，惊惶羞愧。他们像野草，像青菜，如房顶上的草，又如田间未长成的禾稼。
{Isa 37:28} "'I know your sitting down and your going out and coming in, and your raging against me.
{Isa 37:28} 你坐下，你出去，你进来，你向我发烈怒，我都知道。
{Isa 37:29} Because you have raged against me and your complacency has come to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will turn you back on the way by which you came.'
{Isa 37:29} 因你向我发烈怒，又因你狂傲的话达到我耳中，我就要用钩子钩上你的鼻子，把嚼环放在你口里，使你从原路转回去。
{Isa 37:30} "And this shall be the sign for you: this year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from that. Then in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
{Isa 37:30} “以色列人哪，我赐你们一个证据：你们今年要吃自生的，明年也要吃自长的，至于后年，你们要耕种收割，栽植葡萄园，吃其中的果子。
{Isa 37:31} And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
{Isa 37:31} 犹大家所逃脱余剩的，仍要往下扎根，向上结果。
{Isa 37:32} For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
{Isa 37:32} 必有余剩的民从耶路撒冷而出；必有逃脱的人从锡安山而来。万军之耶和华的热心必成就这事。
{Isa 37:33} "Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or cast up a siege mound against it.
{Isa 37:33} “所以耶和华论亚述王如此说：他必不得来到这城，也不在这里射箭，不得拿盾牌到城前，也不筑垒攻城。
{Isa 37:34} By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, declares the LORD.
{Isa 37:34} 他从哪条路来，必从那条路回去，必不得来到这城。这是耶和华说的。
{Isa 37:35} For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."
{Isa 37:35} 因我为自己的缘故，又为我仆人大卫的缘故，必保护拯救这城。”
{Isa 37:36} And the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. And when people arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
{Isa 37:36} 耶和华的使者出去，在亚述营中杀了十八万五千人。清早有人起来一看，都是死尸了。
{Isa 37:37} Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh.
{Isa 37:37} 亚述王西拿基立就拔营回去，住在尼尼微。
{Isa 37:38} And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword. And after they escaped into the land of Ararat, Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
{Isa 37:38} 一日在他的神尼斯洛庙里叩拜，他儿子亚得米勒和沙利色用刀杀了他，就逃到亚拉腊地。他儿子以撒哈顿接续他作王。
{Isa 38:1}  In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, "Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order, for you shall die, you shall not recover."
{Isa 38:1}  那时希西家病得要死，亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚去见他，对他说：“耶和华如此说：你当留遗命与你的家，因为你必死不能活了。”
{Isa 38:2}  Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
{Isa 38:2}  希西家就转脸朝墙，祷告耶和华说：
{Isa 38:3}  and said, "Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
{Isa 38:3}  “耶和华啊，求你记念我在你面前怎样存完全的心，按诚实行事，又做你眼中所看为善的。”希西家就痛哭了。
{Isa 38:4}  Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:
{Isa 38:4}  耶和华的话临到以赛亚说：
{Isa 38:5}  "Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
{Isa 38:5}  “你去告诉希西家说，耶和华你祖大卫的神如此说：我听见了你的祷告，看见了你的眼泪。我必加增你十五年的寿数；
{Isa 38:6}  I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and will defend this city.
{Isa 38:6}  并且我要救你和这城脱离亚述王的手，也要保护这城。
{Isa 38:7}  "This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has promised:
{Isa 38:7}  “我耶和华必成就我所说的。我先给你一个兆头，
{Isa 38:8}  Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps." So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined.
{Isa 38:8}  就是叫亚哈斯的日晷，向前进的日影往后退十度。”于是，前进的日影果然在日晷上往后退了十度。
{Isa 38:9}  A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
{Isa 38:9}  犹大王希西家患病已经痊愈，就作诗说：
{Isa 38:10} I said, In the middle of my days I must depart; I am consigned to the gates of Sheol for the rest of my years.
{Isa 38:10} 我说：正在我中年（或作：晌午）之日必进入阴间的门；我余剩的年岁不得享受。
{Isa 38:11} I said, I shall not see the LORD, the LORD in the land of the living; I shall look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world.
{Isa 38:11} 我说：我必不得见耶和华，就是在活人之地不见耶和华；我与世上的居民不再见面。
{Isa 38:12} My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherd's tent; like a weaver I have rolled up my life; he cuts me off from the loom; from day to night you bring me to an end;
{Isa 38:12} 我的住处被迁去离开我，好像牧人的帐棚一样；我将性命卷起，像织布的卷布一样。耶和华必将我从机头剪断，从早到晚，他要使我完结。
{Isa 38:13} I calmed myself until morning; like a lion he breaks all my bones; from day to night you bring me to an end.
{Isa 38:13} 我使自己安静直到天亮；他像狮子折断我一切的骨头，从早到晚，他要使我完结。
{Isa 38:14} Like a swallow or a crane I chirp; I moan like a dove. My eyes are weary with looking upward. O Lord, I am oppressed; be my pledge of safety!
{Isa 38:14} 我像燕子呢喃，像白鹤鸣叫，又像鸽子哀鸣；我因仰观，眼睛困倦。耶和华啊，我受欺压，求你为我作保。
{Isa 38:15} What shall I say? For he has spoken to me, and he himself has done it. I walk slowly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
{Isa 38:15} 我可说什么呢？他应许我的，也给我成就了。我因心里的苦楚，在一生的年日必悄悄而行。
{Isa 38:16} O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these is the life of my spirit. Oh restore me to health and make me live!
{Isa 38:16} 主啊，人得存活乃在乎此。我灵存活也全在此。所以求你使我痊愈，仍然存活。
{Isa 38:17} Behold, it was for my welfare that I had great bitterness; but in love you have delivered my life from the pit of destruction, for you have cast all my sins behind your back.
{Isa 38:17} 看哪，我受大苦，本为使我得平安；你因爱我的灵魂（或作：生命）便救我脱离败坏的坑，因为你将我一切的罪扔在你的背后。
{Isa 38:18} For Sheol does not thank you; death does not praise you; those who go down to the pit do not hope for your faithfulness.
{Isa 38:18} 原来，阴间不能称谢你，死亡不能颂扬你；下坑的人不能盼望你的诚实。
{Isa 38:19} The living, the living, he thanks you, as I do this day; the father makes known to the children your faithfulness.
{Isa 38:19} 只有活人，活人必称谢你，像我今日称谢你一样。为父的，必使儿女知道你的诚实。
{Isa 38:20} The LORD will save me, and we will play my music on stringed instruments all the days of our lives, at the house of the LORD.
{Isa 38:20} 耶和华肯救我，所以，我们要一生一世在耶和华殿中用丝弦的乐器唱我的诗歌。
{Isa 38:21} Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover."
{Isa 38:21} 以赛亚说：“当取一块无花果饼来，贴在疮上，王必痊愈。”
{Isa 38:22} Hezekiah also had said, "What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?"
{Isa 38:22} 希西家问说：“我能上耶和华的殿，有什么兆头呢？”
{Isa 39:1}  At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
{Isa 39:1}  那时，巴比伦王巴拉但的儿子米罗达巴拉但听见希西家病而痊愈，就送书信和礼物给他。
{Isa 39:2}  And Hezekiah welcomed them gladly. And he showed them his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his whole armory, all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
{Isa 39:2}  希西家喜欢见使者，就把自己宝库的金子、银子、香料、贵重的膏油，和他武库的一切军器，并所有的财宝都给他们看；他家中和全国之内，希西家没有一样不给他们看的。
{Isa 39:3}  Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, "What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?" Hezekiah said, "They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon."
{Isa 39:3}  于是先知以赛亚来见希西家王，问他说：“这些人说什么？他们从那里来见你？”希西家说：“他们从远方的巴比伦来见我。”
{Isa 39:4}  He said, "What have they seen in your house?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them."
{Isa 39:4}  以赛亚说：“他们在你家里看见了什么？”希西家说：“凡我家中所有的，他们都看见了；我财宝中没有一样不给他们看的。”
{Isa 39:5}  Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
{Isa 39:5}  以赛亚对希西家说：“你要听万军之耶和华的话：
{Isa 39:6}  Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the LORD.

{Isa 47:6}  我向我的百姓发怒，使我的产业被亵渎，将他们交在你手中，你毫不怜悯他们，把极重的轭加在老年人身上。
{Isa 47:7}  You said, "I shall be mistress forever," so that you did not lay these things to heart or remember their end.
{Isa 47:7}  你自己说：我必永为主母，所以你不将这事放在心上，也不思想这事的结局。
{Isa 47:8}  Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me; I shall not sit as a widow or know the loss of children":
{Isa 47:8}  你这专好宴乐、安然居住的，现在当听这话。你心中说：惟有我，除我以外再没有别的。我必不至寡居，也不遭丧子之事。
{Isa 47:9}  These two things shall come to you in a moment, in one day; the loss of children and widowhood shall come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the great power of your enchantments.
{Isa 47:9}  哪知，丧子、寡居这两件事在一日转眼之间必临到你；正在你多行邪术、广施符咒的时候，这两件事必全然临到你身上。
{Isa 47:10} You felt secure in your wickedness, you said, "No one sees me"; your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me."
{Isa 47:10} 你素来倚仗自己的恶行，说：无人看见我。你的智慧聪明使你偏邪，并且你心里说：惟有我，除我以外再没有别的。
{Isa 47:11} But evil shall come upon you, which you will not know how to charm away; disaster shall fall upon you, for which you will not be able to atone; and ruin shall come upon you suddenly, of which you know nothing.
{Isa 47:11} 因此，祸患要临到你身；你不知何时发现（或作：如何驱逐）灾害落在你身上，你也不能除掉；所不知道的毁灭也必忽然临到你身。
{Isa 47:12} Stand fast in your enchantments and your many sorceries, with which you have labored from your youth; perhaps you may be able to succeed; perhaps you may inspire terror.
{Isa 47:12} 站起来吧！用你从幼年劳神施行的符咒和你许多的邪术；或者可得益处，或者可得强胜。
{Isa 47:13} You are wearied with your many counsels; let them stand forth and save you, those who divide the heavens, who gaze at the stars, who at the new moons make known what shall come upon you.
{Isa 47:13} 你筹划太多，以致疲倦。让那些观天象的，看星宿的，在月朔说预言的，都站起来，救你脱离所要临到你的事。
{Isa 47:14} Behold, they are like stubble; the fire consumes them; they cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. No coal for warming oneself is this, no fire to sit before!
{Isa 47:14} 他们要像碎秸被火焚烧，不能救自己脱离火焰之力；这火并非可烤的炭火，也不是可以坐在其前的火。
{Isa 47:15} Such to you are those with whom you have labored, who have done business with you from your youth; they wander about, each in his own direction; there is no one to save you.
{Isa 47:15} 你所劳神的事都要这样与你无益；从幼年与你贸易的也都各奔各乡，无人救你。
{Isa 48:1}  Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and who came from the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD and confess the God of Israel, but not in truth or right.
{Isa 48:1}  雅各家，称为以色列名下，从犹大水源出来的，当听我言！你们指着耶和华的名起誓，提说以色列的神，却不凭诚实，不凭公义。
{Isa 48:2}  For they call themselves after the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; the LORD of hosts is his name.
{Isa 48:2}  他们自称为圣城的人，所倚靠的是名为万军之耶和华以色列的神。
{Isa 48:3}  "The former things I declared of old; they went out from my mouth, and I announced them; then suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.
{Isa 48:3}  主说：早先的事，我从古时说明，已经出了我的口，也是我所指示的；我忽然行做，事便成就。
{Isa 48:4}  Because I know that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead brass,
{Isa 48:4}  因为我素来知道你是顽梗的，你的颈项是铁的；你的额是铜的。
{Isa 48:5}  I declared them to you from of old, before they came to pass I announced them to you, lest you should say, 'My idol did them, my carved image and my metal image commanded them.'
{Isa 48:5}  所以，我从古时将这事给你说明，在未成以先指示你，免得你说：这些事是我的偶像所行的，是我雕刻的偶像和我铸造的偶像所命定的。
{Isa 48:6}  "You have heard; now see all this; and will you not declare it? From this time forth I announce to you new things, hidden things that you have not known.
{Isa 48:6}  你已经听见，现在要看见这一切；你不说明吗？从今以后，我将新事，就是你所不知道的隐密事指示你。
{Isa 48:7}  They are created now, not long ago; before today you have never heard of them, lest you should say, 'Behold, I knew them.'
{Isa 48:7}  这事是现今造的，并非从古就有；在今日以先，你也未曾听见，免得你说：这事我早已知道了。
{Isa 48:8}  You have never heard, you have never known, from of old your ear has not been opened. For I knew that you would surely deal treacherously, and that from before birth you were called a rebel.
{Isa 48:8}  你未曾听见，未曾知道；你的耳朵从来未曾开通。我原知道你行事极其诡诈，你自从出胎以来，便称为悖逆的。
{Isa 48:9}  "For my name's sake I defer my anger, for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off.
{Isa 48:9}  我为我的名暂且忍怒，为我的颂赞向你容忍，不将你剪除。
{Isa 48:10} Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.
{Isa 48:10} 我熬炼你，却不像熬炼银子；你在苦难的炉中，我拣选你。
{Isa 48:11} For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.
{Isa 48:11} 我为自己的缘故必行这事，我焉能使我的名被亵渎？我必不将我的荣耀归给假神。
{Isa 48:12} "Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am he; I am the first, and I am the last.
{Isa 48:12} 雅各我所选召的以色列啊，当听我言：我是耶和华，我是首先的，也是末后的。
{Isa 48:13} My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand forth together.
{Isa 48:13} 我手立了地的根基；我右手铺张诸天；我一招呼便都立住。
{Isa 48:14} "Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he shall perform his purpose on Babylon, and his arm shall be against the Chaldeans.
{Isa 48:14} 你们都当聚集而听，他们（或作：偶像）内中谁说过这些事？耶和华所爱的人必向巴比伦行他所喜悦的事；他的膀臂也要加在迦勒底人身上。
{Isa 48:15} I, even I, have spoken and called him; I have brought him, and he will prosper in his way.
{Isa 48:15} 惟有我曾说过，我又选召他，领他来，他的道路就必亨通。
{Isa 48:16} Draw near to me, hear this: from the beginning I have not spoken in secret, from the time it came to be I have been there." And now the Lord GOD has sent me, and his Spirit.
{Isa 48:16} 你们要就近我来听这话：我从起头并未曾在隐密处说话；自从有这事，我就在那里。现在，主耶和华差遣我和他的灵来（或作：耶和华和他的灵差遣我来）。
{Isa 48:17} Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "I am the LORD your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you in the way you should go.
{Isa 48:17} 耶和华你的救赎主，以色列的圣者如此说：我是耶和华你的神，教训你，使你得益处，引导你所当行的路。
{Isa 48:18} Oh that you had paid attention to my commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea;
{Isa 48:18} 甚愿你素来听从我的命令！你的平安就如河水；你的公义就如海浪。
{Isa 48:19} your offspring would have been like the sand, and your descendants like its grains; their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before me."
{Isa 48:19} 你的后裔也必多如海沙；你腹中所生的也必多如沙粒。他的名在我面前必不剪除，也不灭绝。
{Isa 48:20} Go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea, declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it, send it out to the end of the earth; say, "The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!"
{Isa 48:20} 你们要从巴比伦出来，从迦勒底人中逃脱，以欢呼的声音传扬说：耶和华救赎了他的仆人雅各！你们要将这事宣扬到地极。
{Isa 48:21} They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split the rock and the water gushed out.
{Isa 48:21} 耶和华引导他们经过沙漠。他们并不干渴；他为他们使水从磐石而流，分裂磐石，水就涌出。
{Isa 48:22} "There is no peace," says the LORD, "for the wicked."
{Isa 48:22} 耶和华说：恶人必不得平安！
{Isa 49:1}  Listen to me, O coastlands, and give attention, you peoples from afar. The LORD called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name.
{Isa 49:1}  众海岛啊，当听我言！远方的众民哪，留心而听！自我出胎，耶和华就选召我；自出母腹，他就提我的名。
{Isa 49:2}  He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow; in his quiver he hid me away.
{Isa 49:2}  他使我的口如快刀，将我藏在他手荫之下；又使我成为磨亮的箭，将我藏在他箭袋之中；
{Isa 49:3}  And he said to me, "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified."
{Isa 49:3}  对我说：你是我的仆人以色列；我必因你得荣耀。
{Isa 49:4}  But I said, "I have labored in vain; I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely my right is with the LORD, and my recompense with my God."
{Isa 49:4}  我却说：我劳碌是徒然；我尽力是虚无虚空。然而，我当得的理必在耶和华那里；我的赏赐必在我神那里。
{Isa 49:5}  And now the LORD says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him; and that Israel might be gathered to him-- for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD, and my God has become my strength--
{Isa 49:5}  耶和华从我出胎，造就我作他的仆人，要使雅各归向他，使以色列到他那里聚集。原来耶和华看我为尊贵；我的神也成为我的力量。
{Isa 49:6}  he says: "It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel; I will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth."
{Isa 49:6}  现在他说：你作我的仆人，使雅各众支派复兴，使以色列中得保全的归回尚为小事，我还要使你作外邦人的光，叫你施行我的救恩，直到地极。
{Isa 49:7}  Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One, to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nation, the servant of rulers: "Kings shall see and arise; princes, and they shall prostrate themselves; because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you."
{Isa 49:7}  救赎主以色列的圣者耶和华对那被人所藐视、本国所憎恶、官长所虐待的如此说：君王要看见就站起，首领也要下拜；都因信实的耶和华，就是拣选你以色列的圣者。
{Isa 49:8}  Thus says the LORD: "In a time of favor I have answered you; in a day of salvation I have helped you; I will keep you and give you as a covenant to the people, to establish the land, to apportion the desolate heritages,
{Isa 49:8}  耶和华如此说：在悦纳的时候，我应允了你；在拯救的日子，我济助了你。我要保护你，使你作众民的中保（中保：原文作约）；复兴遍地，使人承受荒凉之地为业。
{Isa 49:9}  saying to the prisoners, 'Come out,' to those who are in darkness, 'Appear.' They shall feed along the ways; on all bare heights shall be their pasture;
{Isa 49:9}  对那被捆绑的人说：出来吧！对那在黑暗的人说：显露吧！他们在路上必得饮食，在一切净光的高处必有食物。
{Isa 49:10} they shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them, for he who has pity on them will lead them, and by springs of water will guide them.
{Isa 49:10} 不饥不渴，炎热和烈日必不伤害他们；因为怜恤他们的必引导他们，领他们到水泉旁边。
{Isa 49:11} And I will make all my mountains a road, and my highways shall be raised up.
{Isa 49:11} 我必使我的众山成为大道；我的大路也被修高。
{Isa 49:12} Behold, these shall come from afar, and behold, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Syene."
{Isa 49:12} 看哪，这些从远方来；这些从北方、从西方来；这些从秦（原文作希尼）国来。
{Isa 49:13} Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth; break forth, O mountains, into singing! For the LORD has comforted his people and will have compassion on his afflicted.
{Isa 49:13} 诸天哪，应当欢呼！大地啊，应当快乐！众山哪，应当发声歌唱！因为耶和华已经安慰他的百姓，也要怜恤他困苦之民。
{Isa 49:14} But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me; my Lord has forgotten me."
{Isa 49:14} 锡安说：耶和华离弃了我；主忘记了我。
{Isa 49:15} "Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.
{Isa 49:15} 妇人焉能忘记他吃奶的婴孩，不怜恤他所生的儿子？即或有忘记的，我却不忘记你。
{Isa 49:16} Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.
{Isa 49:16} 看哪，我将你铭刻在我掌上；你的墙垣常在我眼前。
{Isa 49:17} Your builders make haste; your destroyers and those who laid you waste go out from you.
{Isa 49:17} 你的儿女必急速归回；毁坏你的，使你荒废的，必都离你出去，
{Isa 49:18} Lift up your eyes around and see; they all gather, they come to you. As I live, declares the LORD, you shall put them all on as an ornament; you shall bind them on as a bride does.
{Isa 49:18} 你举目向四方观看；他们都聚集来到你这里。耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓：你必要以他们为妆饰佩戴，以他们为华带束腰，像新妇一样。
{Isa 49:19} "Surely your waste and your desolate places and your devastated land-- surely now you will be too narrow for your inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away.
{Isa 49:19} 至于你荒废凄凉之处，并你被毁坏之地，现今众民居住必显为太窄；吞灭你的必离你遥远。
{Isa 49:20} The children of your bereavement will yet say in your ears: 'The place is too narrow for me; make room for me to dwell in.'
{Isa 49:20} 你必听见丧子之后所生的儿女说：这地方我居住太窄，求你给我地方居住。
{Isa 49:21} Then you will say in your heart: 'Who has borne me these? I was bereaved and barren, exiled and put away, but who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; from where have these come?'"
{Isa 49:21} 那时你心里必说：我既丧子独居，是被掳的，漂流在外。谁给我生这些？谁将这些养大呢？撇下我一人独居的时候，这些在那里呢？
{Isa 49:22} Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and raise my signal to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
{Isa 49:22} 主耶和华如此说：我必向列国举手，向万民竖立大旗；他们必将你的众子怀中抱来，将你的众女肩上扛来。
{Isa 49:23} Kings shall be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. With their faces to the ground they shall bow down to you, and lick the dust of your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who wait for me shall not be put to shame."
{Isa 49:23} 列王必作你的养父；王后必作你的乳母。他们必将脸伏地，向你下拜，并舔你脚上的尘土。你便知道我是耶和华；等候我的必不至羞愧。
{Isa 49:24} Can the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?
{Isa 49:24} 勇士抢去的岂能夺回？该掳掠的岂能解救吗？
{Isa 49:25} For thus says the LORD: "Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken, and the prey of the tyrant be rescued, for I will contend with those who contend with you, and I will save your children.
{Isa 49:25} 但耶和华如此说：就是勇士所掳掠的，也可以夺回；强暴人所抢的，也可以解救。与你相争的，我必与他相争；我要拯救你的儿女。
{Isa 49:26} I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh, and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine. Then all flesh shall know that I am the LORD your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."
{Isa 49:26} 并且我必使那欺压你的吃自己的肉，也要以自己的血喝醉，好像喝甜酒一样。凡有血气的必都知道我耶和华是你的救主，是你的救赎主，是雅各的大能者。
{Isa 50:1}  Thus says the LORD: "Where is your mother's certificate of divorce, with which I sent her away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.
{Isa 50:1}  耶和华如此说：我休你们的母亲，休书在那里呢？我将你们卖给我那一个债主呢？你们被卖，是因你们的罪孽；你们的母亲被休，是因你们的过犯。
{Isa 50:2}  Why, when I came, was there no man; why, when I called, was there no one to answer? Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, by my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink for lack of water and die of thirst.
{Isa 50:2}  我来的时候，为何无人等候呢？我呼唤的时候，为何无人答应呢？我的膀臂岂是缩短、不能救赎吗？我岂无拯救之力吗？看哪，我一斥责，海就干了；我使江河变为旷野；其中的鱼因无水腥臭，干渴而死。
{Isa 50:3}  I clothe the heavens with blackness and make sackcloth their covering."
{Isa 50:3}  我使诸天以黑暗为衣服，以麻布为遮盖。
{Isa 50:4}  The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with a word him who is weary. Morning by morning he awakens; he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.

{Isa 50:5}  主耶和华开通我的耳朵；我并没有违背，也没有退后。
{Isa 50:6}  I gave my back to those who strike, and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard; I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting.
{Isa 50:6}  人打我的背，我任他打；人拔我腮颊的胡须，我由他拔；人辱我，吐我，我并不掩面。
{Isa 50:7}  But the Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced; therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.
{Isa 50:7}  主耶和华必帮助我，所以我不抱愧。我硬着脸面好像坚石；我也知道我必不至蒙羞。
{Isa 50:8}  He who vindicates me is near. Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together. Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.
{Isa 50:8}  称我为义的与我相近；谁与我争论，可以与我一同站立；谁与我作对，可以就近我来。
{Isa 50:9}  Behold, the Lord GOD helps me; who will declare me guilty? Behold, all of them will wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up.
{Isa 50:9}  主耶和华要帮助我；谁能定我有罪呢？他们都像衣服渐渐旧了，为蛀虫所咬。
{Isa 50:10} Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of his servant? Let him who walks in darkness and has no light trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.
{Isa 50:10} 你们中间谁是敬畏耶和华、听从他仆人之话的？这人行在暗中，没有亮光。当倚靠耶和华的名，仗赖自己的神。

{Isa 50:11} 凡你们点火，用火把围绕自己的可以行在你们的火焰里，并你们所点的火把中。这是我手所定的；你们必躺在悲惨之中，
{Isa 51:1}  "Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the LORD: look to the rock from which you were hewn, and to the quarry from which you were dug.
{Isa 51:1}  你们这追求公义、寻求耶和华的，当听我言！你们要追想被凿而出的磐石，被挖而出的岩穴。
{Isa 51:2}  Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you; for he was but one when I called him, that I might bless him and multiply him.
{Isa 51:2}  要追想你们的祖宗亚伯拉罕和生养你们的撒拉；因为亚伯拉罕独自一人的时候，我选召他，赐福与他，使他人数增多。
{Isa 51:3}  For the LORD comforts Zion; he comforts all her waste places and makes her wilderness like Eden, her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the voice of song.
{Isa 51:3}  耶和华已经安慰锡安和锡安一切的荒场，使旷野像伊甸，使沙漠像耶和华的园囿；在其中必有欢喜、快乐、感谢，和歌唱的声音。
{Isa 51:4}  "Give attention to me, my people, and give ear to me, my nation; for a law will go out from me, and I will set my justice for a light to the peoples.
{Isa 51:4}  我的百姓啊，要向我留心；我的国民哪，要向我侧耳；因为训诲必从我而出；我必坚定我的公理为万民之光。
{Isa 51:5}  My righteousness draws near, my salvation has gone out, and my arms will judge the peoples; the coastlands hope for me, and for my arm they wait.
{Isa 51:5}  我的公义临近；我的救恩发出。我的膀臂要审判万民；海岛都要等候我，倚赖我的膀臂。
{Isa 51:6}  Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth beneath; for the heavens vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and they who dwell in it will die in like manner; but my salvation will be forever, and my righteousness will never be dismayed.
{Isa 51:6}  你们要向天举目，观看下地；因为天必像烟云消散，地必如衣服渐渐旧了；其上的居民也要如此死亡（如此死亡：或作像蠓虫死亡）。惟有我的救恩永远长存；我的公义也不废掉。
{Isa 51:7}  "Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear not the reproach of man, nor be dismayed at their revilings.
{Isa 51:7}  知道公义、将我训诲存在心中的民，要听我言！不要怕人的辱骂，也不要因人的毁谤惊惶。
{Isa 51:8}  For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool; but my righteousness will be forever, and my salvation to all generations."
{Isa 51:8}  因为蛀虫必咬他们，好像咬衣服；虫子必咬他们，如同咬羊绒。惟有我的公义永远长存，我的救恩直到万代。
{Isa 51:9}  Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in days of old, the generations of long ago. Was it not you who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the dragon?
{Isa 51:9}  耶和华的膀臂啊，兴起！兴起！以能力为衣穿上，像古时的年日、上古的世代兴起一样。从前砍碎拉哈伯、刺透大鱼的，不是你吗？
{Isa 51:10} Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
{Isa 51:10} 使海与深渊的水干涸、使海的深处变为赎民经过之路的，不是你吗？
{Isa 51:11} And the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
{Isa 51:11} 耶和华救赎的民必归回，歌唱来到锡安；永乐必归到他们的头上。他们必得着欢喜快乐；忧愁叹息尽都逃避。
{Isa 51:12} "I, I am he who comforts you; who are you that you are afraid of man who dies, of the son of man who is made like grass,
{Isa 51:12} 惟有我，是安慰你们的。你是谁，竟怕那必死的人？怕那要变如草的世人？
{Isa 51:13} and have forgotten the LORD, your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, and you fear continually all the day because of the wrath of the oppressor, when he sets himself to destroy? And where is the wrath of the oppressor?
{Isa 51:13} 却忘记铺张诸天、立定地基、创造你的耶和华？又因欺压者图谋毁灭要发的暴怒，整天害怕，其实那欺压者的暴怒在那里呢？
{Isa 51:14} He who is bowed down shall speedily be released; he shall not die and go down to the pit, neither shall his bread be lacking.
{Isa 51:14} 被掳去的快得释放，必不死而下坑；他的食物也不至缺乏。

{Isa 51:15} 我是耶和华你的神搅动大海，使海中的波浪砰訇万军之耶和华是我的名。
{Isa 51:16} And I have put my words in your mouth and covered you in the shadow of my hand, establishing the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth, and saying to Zion, 'You are my people.'"
{Isa 51:16} 我将我的话传给你，用我的手影遮蔽你，为要栽定诸天，立定地基，又对锡安说：你是我的百姓。
{Isa 51:17} Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of his wrath, who have drunk to the dregs the bowl, the cup of staggering.
{Isa 51:17} 耶路撒冷啊，兴起！兴起！站起来！你从耶和华手中喝了他忿怒之杯，喝了那使人东倒西歪的爵，以致喝尽。
{Isa 51:18} There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne; there is none to take her by the hand among all the sons she has brought up.
{Isa 51:18} 他所生育的诸子中，没有一个引导他的；他所养大的诸子中，没有一个搀扶他的。
{Isa 51:19} These two things have happened to you-- who will console you?-- devastation and destruction, famine and sword; who will comfort you?
{Isa 51:19} 荒凉、毁灭、饥荒、刀兵，这几样临到你，谁为你举哀？我如何能安慰你呢？
{Isa 51:20} Your sons have fainted; they lie at the head of every street like an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.
{Isa 51:20} 你的众子发昏，在各市口上躺卧，好像黄羊在网罗之中，都满了耶和华的忿怒，你神的斥责。
{Isa 51:21} Therefore hear this, you who are afflicted, who are drunk, but not with wine:
{Isa 51:21} 因此，你这困苦却非因酒而醉的，要听我言。
{Isa 51:22} Thus says your Lord, the LORD, your God who pleads the cause of his people: "Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering; the bowl of my wrath you shall drink no more;
{Isa 51:22} 你的主耶和华就是为他百姓辨屈的神如此说：看哪，我已将那使人东倒西歪的杯，就是我忿怒的爵，从你手中接过来；你必不至再喝。
{Isa 51:23} and I will put it into the hand of your tormentors, who have said to you, 'Bow down, that we may pass over'; and you have made your back like the ground and like the street for them to pass over."
{Isa 51:23} 我必将这杯递在苦待你的人手中；他们曾对你说：你屈身，由我们践踏过去吧！你便以背为地，好像街市，任人经过。
{Isa 52:1}  Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.
{Isa 52:1}  锡安哪，兴起！兴起！披上你的能力！圣城耶路撒冷啊，穿上你华美的衣服！因为从今以后，未受割礼、不洁净的必不再进入你中间。
{Isa 52:2}  Shake yourself from the dust and arise; be seated, O Jerusalem; loose the bonds from your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
{Isa 52:2}  耶路撒冷啊，要抖下尘土！起来坐在位上！锡安被掳的居民（原文作女子）哪，要解开你颈项的锁链！
{Isa 52:3}  For thus says the LORD: "You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money."
{Isa 52:3}  耶和华如此说：“你们是无价被卖的，也必无银被赎。
{Isa 52:4}  For thus says the Lord GOD: "My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there, and the Assyrian oppressed them for nothing.
{Isa 52:4}  主耶和华如此说：起先我的百姓下到埃及，在那里寄居，又有亚述人无故欺压他们。
{Isa 52:5}  Now therefore what have I here," declares the LORD, "seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Their rulers wail," declares the LORD, "and continually all the day my name is despised.
{Isa 52:5}  耶和华说：我的百姓既是无价被掳去，如今我在这里做什么呢？耶和华说：辖制他们的人呼叫，我的名整天受亵渎。
{Isa 52:6}  Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak; here I am."
{Isa 52:6}  所以，我的百姓必知道我的名；到那日他们必知道说这话的就是我。看哪，是我！”
{Isa 52:7}  How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, "Your God reigns."
{Isa 52:7}  那报佳音，传平安，报好信，传救恩的，对锡安说：你的神作王了！这人的脚登山何等佳美！
{Isa 52:8}  The voice of your watchmen--they lift up their voice; together they sing for joy; for eye to eye they see the return of the LORD to Zion.
{Isa 52:8}  听啊，你守望之人的声音，他们扬起声来，一同歌唱；因为耶和华归回锡安的时候，他们必亲眼看见。
{Isa 52:9}  Break forth together into singing, you waste places of Jerusalem, for the LORD has comforted his people; he has redeemed Jerusalem.
{Isa 52:9}  耶路撒冷的荒场啊，要发起欢声，一同歌唱；因为耶和华安慰了他的百姓，救赎了耶路撒冷。
{Isa 52:10} The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
{Isa 52:10} 耶和华在万国眼前露出圣臂；地极的人都看见我们神的救恩了。
{Isa 52:11} Depart, depart, go out from there; touch no unclean thing; go out from the midst of her; purify yourselves, you who bear the vessels of the LORD.
{Isa 52:11} 你们离开吧！离开吧！从巴比伦出来。不要沾不洁净的物；要从其中出来。你们扛抬耶和华器皿的人哪，务要自洁。
{Isa 52:12} For you shall not go out in haste, and you shall not go in flight, for the LORD will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
{Isa 52:12} 你们出来必不至急忙，也不至奔逃。因为，耶和华必在你们前头行；以色列的神必作你们的后盾。
{Isa 52:13} Behold, my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up, and shall be exalted.
{Isa 52:13} 我的仆人行事必有智慧（或作：行事通达），必被高举上升，且成为至高。
{Isa 52:14} As many were astonished at you-- his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of the children of mankind--
{Isa 52:14} 许多人因他（原文作你）惊奇；（他的面貌比别人憔悴；他的形容比世人枯槁。）
{Isa 52:15} so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which has not been told them they see, and that which they have not heard they understand.
{Isa 52:15} 这样，他必洗净（或作：鼓动）许多国民；君王要向他闭口。因所未曾传与他们的，他们必看见；未曾听见的，他们要明白。
{Isa 53:1}  Who has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
{Isa 53:1}  我们所传的（或作：所传与我们的）有谁信呢？耶和华的膀臂向谁显露呢？
{Isa 53:2}  For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.
{Isa 53:2}  他在耶和华面前生长如嫩芽，像根出于干地。他无佳形美容；我们看见他的时候，也无美貌使我们羡慕他。
{Isa 53:3}  He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
{Isa 53:3}  他被藐视，被人厌弃；多受痛苦，常经忧患。他被藐视，好像被人掩面不看的一样；我们也不尊重他。
{Isa 53:4}  Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.
{Isa 53:4}  他诚然担当我们的忧患，背负我们的痛苦；我们却以为他受责罚，被神击打苦待了。
{Isa 53:5}  But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.
{Isa 53:5}  哪知他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤。因他受的刑罚，我们得平安；因他受的鞭伤，我们得医治。
{Isa 53:6}  All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned--every one--to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
{Isa 53:6}  我们都如羊走迷；各人偏行己路；耶和华使我们众人的罪孽都归在他身上。
{Isa 53:7}  He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.
{Isa 53:7}  他被欺压，在受苦的时候却不开口（或作：他受欺压，却自卑不开口）；他像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊在剪毛的人手下无声，他也是这样不开口。
{Isa 53:8}  By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people?
{Isa 53:8}  因受欺压和审判，他被夺去，至于他同世的人，谁想他受鞭打、从活人之地被剪除，是因我百姓的罪过呢？
{Isa 53:9}  And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.
{Isa 53:9}  他虽然未行强暴，口中也没有诡诈，人还使他与恶人同埋；谁知死的时候与财主同葬。
{Isa 53:10} Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.
{Isa 53:10} 耶和华却定意（或作：喜悦）将他压伤，使他受痛苦。耶和华以他为赎罪祭（或作：他献本身为赎罪祭）。他必看见后裔，并且延长年日。耶和华所喜悦的事必在他手中亨通。
{Isa 53:11} Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.
{Isa 53:11} 他必看见自己劳苦的功效，便心满意足。有许多人因认识我的义仆得称为义；并且他要担当他们的罪孽。
{Isa 53:12} Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors.
{Isa 53:12} 所以，我要使他与位大的同分，与强盛的均分掳物。因为他将命倾倒，以致于死；他也被列在罪犯之中。他却担当多人的罪，又为罪犯代求。
{Isa 54:1}  "Sing, O barren one, who did not bear; break forth into singing and cry aloud, you who have not been in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than the children of her who is married," says the LORD.
{Isa 54:1}  你这不怀孕、不生养的要歌唱；你这未曾经过产难的要发声歌唱，扬声欢呼；因为没有丈夫的比有丈夫的儿女更多。这是耶和华说的。
{Isa 54:2}  "Enlarge the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out; do not hold back; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes.
{Isa 54:2}  要扩张你帐幕之地，张大你居所的幔子，不要限止；要放长你的绳子，坚固你的橛子。
{Isa 54:3}  For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left, and your offspring will possess the nations and will people the desolate cities.
{Isa 54:3}  因为你要向左向右开展；你的后裔必得多国为业，又使荒凉的城邑有人居住。
{Isa 54:4}  "Fear not, for you will not be ashamed; be not confounded, for you will not be disgraced; for you will forget the shame of your youth, and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.
{Isa 54:4}  不要惧怕，因你必不至蒙羞；也不要抱愧，因你必不至受辱。你必忘记幼年的羞愧，不再记念你寡居的羞辱。
{Isa 54:5}  For your Maker is your husband, the LORD of hosts is his name; and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer, the God of the whole earth he is called.
{Isa 54:5}  因为造你的是你的丈夫；万军之耶和华是他的名。救赎你的是以色列的圣者；他必称为全地之神。
{Isa 54:6}  For the LORD has called you like a wife deserted and grieved in spirit, like a wife of youth when she is cast off, says your God.
{Isa 54:6}  耶和华召你，如召被离弃心中忧伤的妻，就是幼年所娶被弃的妻。这是你神所说的。
{Isa 54:7}  For a brief moment I deserted you, but with great compassion I will gather you.
{Isa 54:7}  我离弃你不过片时，却要施大恩将你收回。
{Isa 54:8}  In overflowing anger for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you," says the LORD, your Redeemer.
{Isa 54:8}  我的怒气涨溢，顷刻之间向你掩面，却要以永远的慈爱怜恤你。这是耶和华你的救赎主说的。
{Isa 54:9}  "This is like the days of Noah to me: as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, and will not rebuke you.
{Isa 54:9}  这事在我好像挪亚的洪水。我怎样起誓不再使挪亚的洪水漫过遍地，我也照样起誓不再向你发怒，也不斥责你。
{Isa 54:10} For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed," says the LORD, who has compassion on you.
{Isa 54:10} 大山可以挪开，小山可以迁移；但我的慈爱必不离开你；我平安的约也不迁移。这是怜恤你的耶和华说的。
{Isa 54:11} "O afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in antimony, and lay your foundations with sapphires.
{Isa 54:11} 你这受困苦、被风飘荡不得安慰的人哪，我必以彩色安置你的石头，以蓝宝石立定你的根基；
{Isa 54:12} I will make your pinnacles of agate, your gates of carbuncles, and all your wall of precious stones.
{Isa 54:12} 又以红宝石造你的女墙，以红玉造你的城门，以宝石造你四围的边界（或作：外郭）。
{Isa 54:13} All your children shall be taught by the LORD, and great shall be the peace of your children.
{Isa 54:13} 你的儿女都要受耶和华的教训；你的儿女必大享平安。
{Isa 54:14} In righteousness you shall be established; you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.
{Isa 54:14} 你必因公义得坚立，必远离欺压，不至害怕；你必远离惊吓，惊吓必不临近你。
{Isa 54:15} If anyone stirs up strife, it is not from me; whoever stirs up strife with you shall fall because of you.
{Isa 54:15} 即或有人聚集，却不由于我；凡聚集攻击你的，必因你仆倒（或作：投降你）。
{Isa 54:16} Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals and produces a weapon for its purpose. I have also created the ravager to destroy;
{Isa 54:16} 吹嘘炭火、打造合用器械的铁匠是我所造；残害人、行毁灭的也是我所造。
{Isa 54:17} no weapon that is fashioned against you shall succeed, and you shall refute every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD and their vindication from me, declares the LORD."
{Isa 54:17} 凡为攻击你造成的器械必不利用；凡在审判时兴起用舌攻击你的，你必定他为有罪。这是耶和华仆人的产业，是他们从我所得的义。这是耶和华说的。
{Isa 55:1}  "Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
{Isa 55:1}  你们一切干渴的都当就近水来；没有银钱的也可以来。你们都来，买了吃；不用银钱，不用价值，也来买酒和奶。
{Isa 55:2}  Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which does not satisfy? Listen diligently to me, and eat what is good, and delight yourselves in rich food.
{Isa 55:2}  你们为何花钱（原文作平银）买那不足为食物的？用劳碌得来的买那不使人饱足的呢？你们要留意听我的话就能吃那美物，得享肥甘，心中喜乐。
{Isa 55:3}  Incline your ear, and come to me; hear, that your soul may live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, my steadfast, sure love for David.
{Isa 55:3}  你们当就近我来；侧耳而听，就必得活。我必与你们立永约，就是应许大卫那可靠的恩典。
{Isa 55:4}  Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the peoples.
{Isa 55:4}  我已立他作万民的见证，为万民的君王和司令。
{Isa 55:5}  Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know, and a nation that did not know you shall run to you, because of the LORD your God, and of the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you.
{Isa 55:5}  你素不认识的国民，你也必召来；素不认识你的国民也必向你奔跑，都因耶和华你的神以色列的圣者，因为他已经荣耀你。
{Isa 55:6}  "Seek the LORD while he may be found; call upon him while he is near;
{Isa 55:6}  当趁耶和华可寻找的时候寻找他，相近的时候求告他。
{Isa 55:7}  let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
{Isa 55:7}  恶人当离弃自己的道路；不义的人当除掉自己的意念。归向耶和华，耶和华就必怜恤他；当归向我们的神，因为神必广行赦免。
{Isa 55:8}  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.
{Isa 55:8}  耶和华说：我的意念非同你们的意念；我的道路非同你们的道路。
{Isa 55:9}  For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
{Isa 55:9}  天怎样高过地，照样，我的道路高过你们的道路；我的意念高过你们的意念。
{Isa 55:10} "For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
{Isa 55:10} 雨雪从天而降，并不返回，却滋润地土，使地上发芽结实，使撒种的有种，使要吃的有粮。
{Isa 55:11} so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
{Isa 55:11} 我口所出的话也必如此，决不徒然返回，却要成就我所喜悦的，在我发他去成就（发他去成就：或作所命定）的事上必然亨通。
{Isa 55:12} "For you shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and the hills before you shall break forth into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
{Isa 55:12} 你们必欢欢喜喜而出来，平平安安蒙引导。大山小山必在你们面前发声歌唱；田野的树木也都拍掌。
{Isa 55:13} Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress; instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle; and it shall make a name for the LORD, an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off."
{Isa 55:13} 松树长出，代替荆棘；番石榴长出，代替蒺藜。这要为耶和华留名，作为永远的证据，不能剪除。
{Isa 56:1}  Thus says the LORD: "Keep justice, and do righteousness, for soon my salvation will come, and my righteousness be revealed.
{Isa 56:1}  耶和华如此说：你们当守公平，行公义；因我的救恩临近，我的公义将要显现。
{Isa 56:2}  Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath, not profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil."
{Isa 56:2}  谨守安息日而不干犯，禁止己手而不作恶；如此行、如此持守的人便为有福。
{Isa 56:3}  Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, "The LORD will surely separate me from his people"; and let not the eunuch say, "Behold, I am a dry tree."
{Isa 56:3}  与耶和华联合的外邦人不要说：耶和华必定将我从他民中分别出来。太监也不要说：我是枯树。
{Isa 56:4}  For thus says the LORD: "To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant,
{Isa 56:4}  因为耶和华如此说：那些谨守我的安息日，拣选我所喜悦的事，持守我约的太监，
{Isa 56:5}  I will give in my house and within my walls a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.
{Isa 56:5}  我必使他们在我殿中，在我墙内，有记念，有名号，比有儿女的更美。我必赐他们永远的名，不能剪除。
{Isa 56:6}  "And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD, to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it, and holds fast my covenant--
{Isa 56:6}  还有那些与耶和华联合的外邦人，要事奉他，要爱耶和华的名，要作他的仆人，就是凡守安息日不干犯，又持守他（原文作我）约的人。
{Isa 56:7}  these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples."
{Isa 56:7}  我必领他们到我的圣山，使他们在祷告我的殿中喜乐。他们的燔祭和平安祭，在我坛上必蒙悦纳，因我的殿必称为万民祷告的殿。
{Isa 56:8}  The Lord GOD, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares, "I will gather yet others to him besides those already gathered."
{Isa 56:8}  主耶和华，就是招聚以色列被赶散的，说：在这被招聚的人以外，我还要招聚别人归并他们。
{Isa 56:9}  All you beasts of the field, come to devour-- all you beasts in the forest.
{Isa 56:9}  田野的诸兽都来吞吃吧！林中的诸兽也要如此。
{Isa 56:10} His watchmen are blind; they are all without knowledge; they are all silent dogs; they cannot bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
{Isa 56:10} 他看守的人是瞎眼的，都没有知识，都是哑巴狗，不能叫唤；但知做梦，躺卧，贪睡，
{Isa 56:11} The dogs have a mighty appetite; they never have enough. But they are shepherds who have no understanding; they have all turned to their own way, each to his own gain, one and all.
{Isa 56:11} 这些狗贪食，不知饱足。这些牧人不能明白，各人偏行己路，各从各方求自己的利益。
{Isa 56:12} "Come," they say, "let me get wine; let us fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow will be like this day, great beyond measure."
{Isa 56:12} 他们说：来吧！我去拿酒，我们饱饮浓酒；明日必和今日一样，就是宴乐无量极大之日。
{Isa 57:1}  The righteous man perishes, and no one lays it to heart; devout men are taken away, while no one understands. For the righteous man is taken away from calamity;
{Isa 57:1}  义人死亡，无人放在心上；虔诚人被收去，无人思念。这义人被收去是免了将来的祸患；
{Isa 57:2}  he enters into peace; they rest in their beds who walk in their uprightness.
{Isa 57:2}  他们得享（原文作进入）平安。素行正直的，各人在坟里（原文作床上）安歇。
{Isa 57:3}  But you, draw near, sons of the sorceress, offspring of the adulterer and the loose woman.
{Isa 57:3}  你们这些巫婆的儿子，奸夫和妓女的种子，都要前来！
{Isa 57:4}  Whom are you mocking? Against whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, the offspring of deceit,
{Isa 57:4}  你们向谁戏笑？向谁张口吐舌呢？你们岂不是悖逆的儿女，虚谎的种类呢？
{Isa 57:5}  you who burn with lust among the oaks, under every green tree, who slaughter your children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
{Isa 57:5}  你们在橡树中间，在各青翠树下欲火攻心；在山谷间，在石穴下杀了儿女；
{Isa 57:6}  Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they, are your lot; to them you have poured out a drink offering, you have brought a grain offering. Shall I relent for these things?
{Isa 57:6}  在谷中光滑石头里有你的分。这些就是你所得的分；你也向他浇了奠祭，献了供物，因这事我岂能容忍吗？
{Isa 57:7}  On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed, and there you went up to offer sacrifice.
{Isa 57:7}  你在高而又高的山上安设床榻，也上那里去献祭。
{Isa 57:8}  Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your memorial; for, deserting me, you have uncovered your bed, you have gone up to it, you have made it wide; and you have made a covenant for yourself with them, you have loved their bed, you have looked on nakedness.
{Isa 57:8}  你在门后，在门框后，立起你的纪念；向外人赤露，又上去扩张床榻，与他们立约；你在那里看见他们的床就甚喜爱。
{Isa 57:9}  You journeyed to the king with oil and multiplied your perfumes; you sent your envoys far off, and sent down even to Sheol.
{Isa 57:9}  你把油带到王那里，又多加香料，打发使者往远方去，自卑自贱直到阴间，
{Isa 57:10} You were wearied with the length of your way, but you did not say, "It is hopeless"; you found new life for your strength, and so you were not faint.
{Isa 57:10} 你因路远疲倦，却不说这是枉然；你以为有复兴之力，所以不觉疲惫。
{Isa 57:11} Whom did you dread and fear, so that you lied, and did not remember me, did not lay it to heart? Have I not held my peace, even for a long time, and you do not fear me?
{Isa 57:11} 你怕谁？因谁恐惧？竟说谎，不记念我，又不将这事放在心上。我不是许久闭口不言，你仍不怕我吗？
{Isa 57:12} I will declare your righteousness and your deeds, but they will not profit you.
{Isa 57:12} 我要指明你的公义；至于你所行的都必与你无益。
{Isa 57:13} When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you! The wind will carry them all off, a breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain.
{Isa 57:13} 你哀求的时候，让你所聚集的拯救你吧！风要把他们刮散，一口气要把他们都吹去。但那投靠我的必得地土，必承受我的圣山为业。
{Isa 57:14} And it shall be said, "Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove every obstruction from my people's way."
{Isa 57:14} 耶和华要说：你们修筑修筑，预备道路，将绊脚石从我百姓的路中除掉。
{Isa 57:15} For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: "I dwell in the high and holy place, and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
{Isa 57:15} 因为那至高至上、永远长存（原文作住在永远）名为圣者的如此说：我住在至高至圣的所在，也与心灵痛悔谦卑的人同居；要使谦卑人的灵苏醒，也使痛悔人的心苏醒。
{Isa 57:16} For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry; for the spirit would grow faint before me, and the breath of life that I made.
{Isa 57:16} 我必不永远相争，也不长久发怒，恐怕我所造的人与灵性都必发昏。
{Isa 57:17} Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry, I struck him; I hid my face and was angry, but he went on backsliding in the way of his own heart.
{Isa 57:17} 因他贪婪的罪孽，我就发怒击打他；我向他掩面发怒，他却仍然随心背道。
{Isa 57:18} I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners,
{Isa 57:18} 我看见他所行的道，也要医治他；又要引导他，使他和那一同伤心的人再得安慰。
{Isa 57:19} creating the fruit of the lips. Peace, peace, to the far and to the near," says the LORD, "and I will heal him.
{Isa 57:19} 我造就嘴唇的果子；愿平安康泰归与远处的人，也归与近处的人；并且我要医治他。这是耶和华说的。
{Isa 57:20} But the wicked are like the tossing sea; for it cannot be quiet, and its waters toss up mire and dirt.
{Isa 57:20} 惟独恶人，好像翻腾的海，不得平静；其中的水常涌出污秽和淤泥来。
{Isa 57:21} There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."
{Isa 57:21} 我的神说：恶人必不得平安！
{Isa 58:1}  "Cry aloud; do not hold back; lift up your voice like a trumpet; declare to my people their transgression, to the house of Jacob their sins.
{Isa 58:1}  你要大声喊叫，不可止息；扬起声来，好像吹角。向我百姓说明他们的过犯；向雅各家说明他们的罪恶。
{Isa 58:2}  Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways, as if they were a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the judgment of their God; they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.
{Isa 58:2}  他们天天寻求我，乐意明白我的道，好像行义的国民，不离弃他们神的典章，向我求问公义的判语，喜悦亲近神。
{Isa 58:3}  'Why have we fasted, and you see it not? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?' Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, and oppress all your workers.
{Isa 58:3}  他们说：我们禁食，你为何不看见呢？我们刻苦己心，你为何不理会呢？看哪，你们禁食的日子仍求利益，勒逼人为你们做苦工。
{Isa 58:4}  Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with a wicked fist. Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high.
{Isa 58:4}  你们禁食，却互相争竞，以凶恶的拳头打人。你们今日禁食，不得使你们的声音听闻于上。
{Isa 58:5}  Is such the fast that I choose, a day for a person to humble himself? Is it to bow down his head like a reed, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and a day acceptable to the LORD?
{Isa 58:5}  这样禁食岂是我所拣选、使人刻苦己心的日子吗？岂是叫人垂头像苇子，用麻布和炉灰铺在他以下吗？你这可称为禁食、为耶和华所悦纳的日子吗？
{Isa 58:6}  "Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?
{Isa 58:6}  我所拣选的禁食不是要松开凶恶的绳，解下轭上的索，使被欺压的得自由，折断一切的轭吗？
{Isa 58:7}  Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover him, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?
{Isa 58:7}  不是要把你的饼分给饥饿的人，将飘流的穷人接到你家中，见赤身的给他衣服遮体，顾恤自己的骨肉而不掩藏吗？
{Isa 58:8}  Then shall your light break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up speedily; your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.
{Isa 58:8}  这样，你的光就必发现如早晨的光；你所得的医治要速速发明。你的公义必在你前面行；耶和华的荣光必作你的后盾。
{Isa 58:9}  Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, 'Here I am.' If you take away the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,
{Isa 58:9}  那时你求告，耶和华必应允；你呼求，他必说：我在这里。你若从你中间除掉重轭和指摘人的指头，并发恶言的事，
{Isa 58:10} if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.
{Isa 58:10} 你心若向饥饿的人发怜悯，使困苦的人得满足，你的光就必在黑暗中发现；你的幽暗必变如正午。
{Isa 58:11} And the LORD will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scorched places and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.
{Isa 58:11} 耶和华也必时常引导你，在干旱之地使你心满意足，骨头强壮。你必像浇灌的园子，又像水流不绝的泉源。
{Isa 58:12} And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to dwell in.
{Isa 58:12} 那些出于你的人必修造久已荒废之处；你要建立拆毁累代的根基。你必称为补破口的，和重修路径与人居住的。
{Isa 58:13} "If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight and the holy day of the LORD honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly;
{Isa 58:13} 你若在安息日掉转（或作：谨慎）你的脚步，在我圣日不以操作为喜乐，称安息日为可喜乐的，称耶和华的圣日为可尊重的；而且尊敬这日，不办自己的私事，不随自己的私意，不说自己的私话，
{Isa 58:14} then you shall take delight in the LORD, and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
{Isa 58:14} 你就以耶和华为乐。耶和华要使你乘驾地的高处，又以你祖雅各的产业养育你。这是耶和华亲口说的。
{Isa 59:1}  Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;
{Isa 59:1}  耶和华的膀臂并非缩短，不能拯救，耳朵并非发沉，不能听见，
{Isa 59:2}  but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.
{Isa 59:2}  但你们的罪孽使你们与神隔绝；你们的罪恶使他掩面不听你们。
{Isa 59:3}  For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies; your tongue mutters wickedness.
{Isa 59:3}  因你们的手被血沾染，你们的指头被罪孽沾污，你们的嘴唇说谎言，你们的舌头出恶语。
{Isa 59:4}  No one enters suit justly; no one goes to law honestly; they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity.
{Isa 59:4}  无一人按公义告状，无一人凭诚实辨白；都倚靠虚妄，说谎言。所怀的是毒害；所生的是罪孽。
{Isa 59:5}  They hatch adders' eggs; they weave the spider's web; he who eats their eggs dies, and from one that is crushed a viper is hatched.
{Isa 59:5}  他们抱毒蛇蛋，结蜘蛛网；人吃这蛋必死。这蛋被踏，必出蝮蛇。
{Isa 59:6}  Their webs will not serve as clothing; men will not cover themselves with what they make. Their works are works of iniquity, and deeds of violence are in their hands.
{Isa 59:6}  所结的网不能成为衣服；所做的也不能遮盖自己。他们的行为都是罪孽；手所做的都是强暴。
{Isa 59:7}  Their feet run to evil, and they are swift to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their highways.
{Isa 59:7}  他们的脚奔跑行恶；他们急速流无辜人的血；意念都是罪孽，所经过的路都荒凉毁灭。
{Isa 59:8}  The way of peace they do not know, and there is no justice in their paths; they have made their roads crooked; no one who treads on them knows peace.
{Isa 59:8}  平安的路，他们不知道；所行的事没有公平。他们为自己修弯曲的路；凡行此路的都不知道平安。
{Isa 59:9}  Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us; we hope for light, and behold, darkness, and for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
{Isa 59:9}  因此，公平离我们远，公义追不上我们。我们指望光亮，却是黑暗，指望光明，却行幽暗。
{Isa 59:10} We grope for the wall like the blind; we grope like those who have no eyes; we stumble at noon as in the twilight, among those in full vigor we are like dead men.
{Isa 59:10} 我们摸索墙壁，好像瞎子；我们摸索，如同无目之人。我们晌午绊脚，如在黄昏一样；我们在肥壮人中，像死人一般。
{Isa 59:11} We all growl like bears; we moan and moan like doves; we hope for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us.
{Isa 59:11} 我们咆哮如熊，哀鸣如鸽；指望公平，却是没有；指望救恩，却远离我们。
{Isa 59:12} For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities:
{Isa 59:12} 我们的过犯在你面前增多，罪恶作见证告我们；过犯与我们同在。至于我们的罪孽，我们都知道：
{Isa 59:13} transgressing, and denying the LORD, and turning back from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart lying words.
{Isa 59:13} 就是悖逆、不认识耶和华，转去不跟从我们的神，说欺压和叛逆的话，心怀谎言，随即说出。
{Isa 59:14} Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far away; for truth has stumbled in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter.
{Isa 59:14} 并且公平转而退后，公义站在远处；诚实在街上仆倒，正直也不得进入。
{Isa 59:15} Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. The LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.
{Isa 59:15} 诚实少见；离恶的人反成掠物。那时，耶和华看见没有公平，甚不喜悦。
{Isa 59:16} He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intercede; then his own arm brought him salvation, and his righteousness upheld him.
{Isa 59:16} 他见无人拯救，无人代求，甚为诧异，就用自己的膀臂施行拯救，以公义扶持自己。
{Isa 59:17} He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak.
{Isa 59:17} 他以公义为铠甲（或作：护心镜），以拯救为头盔，以报仇为衣服，以热心为外袍。
{Isa 59:18} According to their deeds, so will he repay, wrath to his adversaries, repayment to his enemies; to the coastlands he will render repayment.
{Isa 59:18} 他必按人的行为施报，恼怒他的敌人，报复他的仇敌向众海岛施行报应。
{Isa 59:19} So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come like a rushing stream, which the wind of the LORD drives.
{Isa 59:19} 如此，人从日落之处必敬畏耶和华的名，从日出之地也必敬畏他的荣耀；因为仇敌好像急流的河水冲来，是耶和华之气所驱逐的。
{Isa 59:20} "And a Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression," declares the LORD.
{Isa 59:20} 必有一位救赎主来到锡安雅各族中转离过犯的人那里。这是耶和华说的。
{Isa 59:21} "And as for me, this is my covenant with them," says the LORD: "My Spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your offspring, or out of the mouth of your children's offspring," says the LORD, "from this time forth and forevermore."
{Isa 59:21} 耶和华说：“至于我与他们所立的约乃是这样：我加给你的灵，传给你的话，必不离你的口，也不离你后裔与你后裔之后裔的口，从今直到永远；这是耶和华说的。”
{Isa 60:1}  Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.
{Isa 60:1}  兴起，发光！因为你的光已经来到！耶和华的荣耀发现照耀你。
{Isa 60:2}  For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.
{Isa 60:2}  看哪，黑暗遮盖大地，幽暗遮盖万民，耶和华却要显现照耀你；他的荣耀要现在你身上。
{Isa 60:3}  And nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.
{Isa 60:3}  万国要来就你的光；君王要来就你发现的光辉。
{Isa 60:4}  Lift up your eyes all around, and see; they all gather together, they come to you; your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried on the hip.
{Isa 60:4}  你举目向四方观看；众人都聚集来到你这里。你的众子从远方而来；你的众女也被怀抱而来。
{Isa 60:5}  Then you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and exult, because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you.
{Isa 60:5}  那时，你看见就有光荣；你心又跳动又宽畅；因为大海丰盛的货物必转来归你；列国的财宝也必来归你。
{Isa 60:6}  A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD.
{Isa 60:6}  成群的骆驼，并米甸和以法的独峰驼必遮满你；示巴的众人都必来到；要奉上黄金乳香，又要传说耶和华的赞美。
{Isa 60:7}  All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you; the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will beautify my beautiful house.
{Isa 60:7}  基达的羊群都必聚集到你这里，尼拜约的公羊要供你使用，在我坛上必蒙悦纳；我必荣耀我荣耀的殿。
{Isa 60:8}  Who are these that fly like a cloud, and like doves to their windows?
{Isa 60:8}  那些飞来如云、又如鸽子向窗户飞回的是谁呢？
{Isa 60:9}  For the coastlands shall hope for me, the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your children from afar, their silver and gold with them, for the name of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has made you beautiful.
{Isa 60:9}  众海岛必等候我，首先是他施的船只，将你的众子连他们的金银从远方一同带来，都为耶和华你神的名，又为以色列的圣者，因为他已经荣耀了你。
{Isa 60:10} Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you; for in my wrath I struck you, but in my favor I have had mercy on you.
{Isa 60:10} 外邦人必建筑你的城墙；他们的王必服事你。我曾发怒击打你，现今却施恩怜恤你。
{Isa 60:11} Your gates shall be open continually; day and night they shall not be shut, that people may bring to you the wealth of the nations, with their kings led in procession.
{Isa 60:11} 你的城门必时常开放，昼夜不关；使人把列国的财物带来归你，并将他们的君王牵引而来。
{Isa 60:12} For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; those nations shall be utterly laid waste.
{Isa 60:12} 哪一邦哪一国不事奉你，就必灭亡，也必全然荒废。
{Isa 60:13} The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress, the plane, and the pine, to beautify the place of my sanctuary, and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
{Isa 60:13} 利巴嫩的荣耀，就是松树、杉树、黄杨树，都必一同归你，为要修饰我圣所之地；我也要使我脚踏之处得荣耀。
{Isa 60:14} The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending low to you, and all who despised you shall bow down at your feet; they shall call you the City of the LORD, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
{Isa 60:14} 素来苦待你的，他的子孙都必屈身来就你；藐视你的，都要在你脚下跪拜。他们要称你为“耶和华的城”，为“以色列圣者的锡安”。
{Isa 60:15} Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, with no one passing through, I will make you majestic forever, a joy from age to age.
{Isa 60:15} 你虽然被撇弃被厌恶，甚至无人经过，我却使你变为永远的荣华，成为累代的喜乐。
{Isa 60:16} You shall suck the milk of nations; you shall nurse at the breast of kings; and you shall know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
{Isa 60:16} 你也必吃万国的奶，又吃君王的奶。你便知道我耶和华是你的救主，是你的救赎主，雅各的大能者。
{Isa 60:17} Instead of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver; instead of wood, bronze, instead of stones, iron. I will make your overseers peace and your taskmasters righteousness.
{Isa 60:17} 我要拿金子代替铜，拿银子代替铁，拿铜代替木头，拿铁代替石头；并要以和平为你的官长，以公义为你的监督。
{Isa 60:18} Violence shall no more be heard in your land, devastation or destruction within your borders; you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.
{Isa 60:18} 你地上不再听见强暴的事，境内不再听见荒凉毁灭的事。你必称你的墙为“拯救”，称你的门为“赞美”。
{Isa 60:19} The sun shall be no more your light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give you light; but the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.
{Isa 60:19} 日头不再作你白昼的光；月亮也不再发光照耀你。耶和华却要作你永远的光；你神要为你的荣耀。
{Isa 60:20} Your sun shall no more go down, nor your moon withdraw itself; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of mourning shall be ended.
{Isa 60:20} 你的日头不再下落；你的月亮也不退缩；因为耶和华必作你永远的光。你悲哀的日子也完毕了。
{Isa 60:21} Your people shall all be righteous; they shall possess the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I might be glorified.
{Isa 60:21} 你的居民都成为义人，永远得地为业；是我种的栽子，我手的工作，使我得荣耀。
{Isa 60:22} The least one shall become a clan, and the smallest one a mighty nation; I am the LORD; in its time I will hasten it.
{Isa 60:22} 至小的族要加增千倍；微弱的国必成为强盛。我耶和华要按定期速成这事。
{Isa 61:1}  The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
{Isa 61:1}  主耶和华的灵在我身上；因为耶和华用膏膏我，叫我传好信息给谦卑的人（或作：传福音给贫穷的人），差遣我医好伤心的人，报告被掳的得释放，被囚的出监牢；
{Isa 61:2}  to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
{Isa 61:2}  报告耶和华的恩年，和我们神报仇的日子；安慰一切悲哀的人，
{Isa 61:3}  to grant to those who mourn in Zion-- to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.
{Isa 61:3}  赐华冠与锡安悲哀的人，代替灰尘；喜乐油代替悲哀；赞美衣代替忧伤之灵；使他们称为“公义树”，是耶和华所栽的，叫他得荣耀。
{Isa 61:4}  They shall build up the ancient ruins; they shall raise up the former devastations; they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.
{Isa 61:4}  他们必修造已久的荒场，建立先前凄凉之处，重修历代荒凉之城。
{Isa 61:5}  Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks; foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;
{Isa 61:5}  那时，外人必起来牧放你们的羊群；外邦人必作你们耕种田地的，修理葡萄园的。
{Isa 61:6}  but you shall be called the priests of the LORD; they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God; you shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory you shall boast.
{Isa 61:6}  你们倒要称为耶和华的祭司；人必称你们为我们神的仆役。你们必吃用列国的财物，因得他们的荣耀自夸。
{Isa 61:7}  Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion; instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot; therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion; they shall have everlasting joy.
{Isa 61:7}  你们必得加倍的好处，代替所受的羞辱；分中所得的喜乐，必代替所受的凌辱。在境内必得加倍的产业；永远之乐必归与你们（原文作他们）。
{Isa 61:8}  For I the LORD love justice; I hate robbery and wrong; I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
{Isa 61:8}  因为我耶和华喜爱公平，恨恶抢夺和罪孽；我要凭诚实施行报应，并要与我的百姓立永约。
{Isa 61:9}  Their offspring shall be known among the nations, and their descendants in the midst of the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.
{Isa 61:9}  他们的后裔必在列国中被人认识；他们的子孙在众民中也是如此。凡看见他们的必认他们是耶和华赐福的后裔。
{Isa 61:10} I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
{Isa 61:10} 我因耶和华大大欢喜；我的心靠神快乐。因他以拯救为衣给我穿上，以公义为袍给我披上，好像新郎戴上华冠，又像新妇佩戴妆饰。
{Isa 61:11} For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up before all the nations.
{Isa 61:11} 田地怎样使百谷发芽，园子怎样使所种的发生，主耶和华必照样使公义和赞美在万民中发出。
{Isa 62:1}  For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning torch.
{Isa 62:1}  我因锡安必不静默，为耶路撒冷必不息声，直到他的公义如光辉发出，他的救恩如明灯发亮。
{Isa 62:2}  The nations shall see your righteousness, and all the kings your glory, and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will give.
{Isa 62:2}  列国必见你的公义；列王必见你的荣耀。你必得新名的称呼，是耶和华亲口所起的。
{Isa 62:3}  You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
{Isa 62:3}  你在耶和华的手中要作为华冠，在你神的掌上必作为冕旒。
{Isa 62:4}  You shall no more be termed Forsaken, and your land shall no more be termed Desolate, but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married; for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.
{Isa 62:4}  你必不再称为“撇弃的”；你的地也不再称为“荒凉的”。你却要称为“我所喜悦的”；你的地也必称为“有夫之妇”。因为耶和华喜悦你，你的地也必归他。
{Isa 62:5}  For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your sons marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.
{Isa 62:5}  少年人怎样娶处女，你的众民（民：原文作子）也要照样娶你；新郎怎样喜悦新妇，你的神也要照样喜悦你。
{Isa 62:6}  On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen; all the day and all the night they shall never be silent. You who put the LORD in remembrance, take no rest,
{Isa 62:6}  耶路撒冷啊，我在你城上设立守望的，他们昼夜必不静默。呼吁耶和华的，你们不要歇息，
{Isa 62:7}  and give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes it a praise in the earth.
{Isa 62:7}  也不要使他歇息，直等他建立耶路撒冷，使耶路撒冷在地上成为可赞美的。
{Isa 62:8}  The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: "I will not again give your grain to be food for your enemies, and foreigners shall not drink your wine for which you have labored;
{Isa 62:8}  耶和华指着自己的右手和大能的膀臂起誓说：我必不再将你的五谷给你仇敌作食物；外邦人也不再喝你劳碌得来的新酒。
{Isa 62:9}  but those who garner it shall eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary."
{Isa 62:9}  惟有那收割的要吃，并赞美耶和华；那聚敛的要在我圣所的院内喝。
{Isa 62:10} Go through, go through the gates; prepare the way for the people; build up, build up the highway; clear it of stones; lift up a signal over the peoples.
{Isa 62:10} 你们当从门经过经过，预备百姓的路；修筑修筑大道，捡去石头，为万民竖立大旗，
{Isa 62:11} Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him."
{Isa 62:11} 看哪，耶和华曾宣告到地极，对锡安的居民（原文作女子）说：你的拯救者来到。他的赏赐在他那里；他的报应在他面前。
{Isa 62:12} And they shall be called The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD; and you shall be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.
{Isa 62:12} 人必称他们为“圣民”，为“耶和华的赎民”；你也必称为“被眷顾、不撇弃的城”。

{Isa 63:1}  这从以东的波斯拉来，穿红衣服，装扮华美，能力广大，大步行走的是谁呢？就是我，是凭公义说话，以大能施行拯救。
{Isa 63:2}  Why is your apparel red, and your garments like his who treads in the winepress?
{Isa 63:2}  你的装扮为何有红色？你的衣服为何像踹酒榨的呢？

{Isa 63:11} 那时，他们（原文作他）想起古时的日子，摩西和他百姓，说：将百姓和牧养他全群的人从海里领上来的在那里呢？将他的圣灵降在他们中间的在那里呢？
{Isa 63:12} who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them to make for himself an everlasting name,
{Isa 63:12} 使他荣耀的膀臂在摩西的右手边行动，在他们前面将水分开，要建立自己永远的名，

{Isa 63:13} 带领他们经过深处，如马行走旷野，使他们不至绊跌的在那里呢？

{Isa 63:17} O LORD, why do you make us wander from your ways and harden our heart, so that we fear you not? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your heritage.
{Isa 63:17} 耶和华啊，你为何使我们走差离开你的道，使我们心里刚硬、不敬畏你呢？求你为你仆人，为你产业支派的缘故，转回来。
{Isa 63:18} Your holy people held possession for a little while; our adversaries have trampled down your sanctuary.
{Isa 63:18} 你的圣民不过暂时得这产业；我们的敌人已经践踏你的圣所。
{Isa 63:19} We have become like those over whom you have never ruled, like those who are not called by your name.
{Isa 63:19} 我们好像你未曾治理的人，又像未曾得称你名下的人。

{Isa 64:7}  并且无人求告你的名；无人奋力抓住你。原来你掩面不顾我们，使我们因罪孽消化。
{Isa 64:8}  But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.
{Isa 64:8}  耶和华啊，现在你仍是我们的父！我们是泥，你是窑匠；我们都是你手的工作。

{Isa 65:4}  在坟墓间坐着，在隐密处住宿，吃猪肉；他们器皿中有可憎之物做的汤；
{Isa 65:5}  who say, "Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am too holy for you." These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all the day.
{Isa 65:5}  且对人说：你站开吧！不要挨近我，因为我比你圣洁。主说：这些人是我鼻中的烟，是整天烧着的火。
{Isa 65:6}  Behold, it is written before me: "I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will indeed repay into their lap
{Isa 65:6}  看哪，这都写在我面前。我必不静默，必施行报应，必将你们的罪孽和你们列祖的罪孽，就是在山上烧香，在冈上亵渎我的罪孽，一同报应在他们后人怀中，我先要把他们所行的量给他们；这是耶和华说的。
{Isa 65:7}  both your iniquities and your fathers' iniquities together, says the LORD; because they made offerings on the mountains and insulted me on the hills, I will measure into their lap payment for their former deeds."
{Isa 65:7}  (SEE 65:6)

{Isa 65:22} 他们建造的，别人不得住；他们栽种的，别人不得吃；因为我民的日子必像树木的日子；我选民亲手劳碌得来的必长久享用。
{Isa 65:23} They shall not labor in vain or bear children for calamity, for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD, and their descendants with them.

{Isa 66:2}  All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the LORD. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.
{Isa 66:2}  耶和华说：这一切都是我手所造的，所以就都有了。但我所看顾的，就是虚心（原文作贫穷）痛悔、因我话而战兢的人。
{Isa 66:3}  "He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck; he who presents a grain offering, like one who offers pig's blood; he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like one who blesses an idol. These have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations;
{Isa 66:3}  假冒为善的宰牛，好像杀人，献羊羔，好像打折狗项，献供物，好像献猪血，烧乳香，好像称颂偶像。这等人拣选自己的道路，心里喜悦行可憎恶的事。

{Isa 66:5}  Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: "Your brothers who hate you and cast you out for my name's sake have said, 'Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy'; but it is they who shall be put to shame.
{Isa 66:5}  你们因耶和华言语战兢的人当听他的话：你们的弟兄，就是恨恶你们，因我名赶出你们的，曾说：愿耶和华得荣耀，使我们得见你们的喜乐；但蒙羞的究竟是他们！
{Isa 66:6}  "The sound of an uproar from the city! A sound from the temple! The sound of the LORD, rendering recompense to his enemies!

{Isa 66:11} that you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breast; that you may drink deeply with delight from her glorious abundance."
{Isa 66:11} 使你们在他安慰的怀中吃奶得饱，使他们得他丰盛的荣耀，犹如挤奶，满心喜乐。

{Isa 66:12} 耶和华如此说：我要使平安延及他，好像江河，使列国的荣耀延及他，如同涨溢的河。你们要从中享受（原文作咂）；你们必蒙抱在肋旁，摇弄在膝上。
{Isa 66:13} As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

{Isa 66:18} “我知道他们的行为和他们的意念。时候将到，我必将万民万族（族：原文作舌）聚来，看见我的荣耀，
{Isa 66:19} and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations.
{Isa 66:19} 我要显神迹（或作：记号）在他们中间。逃脱的，我要差到列国去，就是到他施、普勒、拉弓的路德和土巴、雅完，并素来没有听见我名声、没有看见我荣耀辽远的海岛；他们必将我的荣耀传扬在列国中。
{Isa 66:20} And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.
{Isa 66:20} 他们必将你们的弟兄从列国中送回，使他们或骑马，或坐车，坐轿，骑骡子，骑独峰驼，到我的圣山耶路撒冷，作为供物献给耶和华，好像以色列人用洁净的器皿盛供物奉到耶和华的殿中；这是耶和华说的。
{Isa 66:21} And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.
{Isa 66:21} 耶和华说：我也必从他们中间取人为祭司，为利未人。”
{Isa 66:22} "For as the new heavens and the new earth that I make shall remain before me, says the LORD, so shall your offspring and your name remain.
