{Deu 1:1}   These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
{Deu 1:1}   以下所记的是摩西在约但河东的旷野、疏弗对面的亚拉巴，就是巴兰、陀弗、拉班、哈洗录、底撒哈中间向以色列众人所说的话。
{Deu 1:2}   It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.
{Deu 1:2}   （从何烈山经过西珥山到加低斯巴尼亚有十一天的路程。）
{Deu 1:3}   In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them,
{Deu 1:3}   出埃及第四十年十一月初一日，摩西照耶和华藉着他所吩咐以色列人的话都晓谕他们。
{Deu 1:4}   after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in Edrei.
{Deu 1:4}   那时，他已经击杀了住希实本的亚摩利王西宏和住以得来、亚斯他录的巴珊王噩。
{Deu 1:5}   Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law, saying,
{Deu 1:5}   摩西在约但河东的摩押地讲律法说：
{Deu 1:6}   "The LORD our God said to us in Horeb, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain.
{Deu 1:6}   “耶和华我们的神在何烈山晓谕我们说：你们在这山上住的日子够了；
{Deu 1:7}   Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negeb and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
{Deu 1:7}   要起行转到亚摩利人的山地和靠近这山地的各处，就是亚拉巴、山地、高原、南地，沿海一带迦南人的地，并利巴嫩山又到伯拉大河。
{Deu 1:8}   See, I have set the land before you. Go in and take possession of the land that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their offspring after them.'
{Deu 1:8}   如今我将这地摆在你们面前；你们要进去得这地，就是耶和华向你们列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓应许赐给他们和他们后裔为业之地。”
{Deu 1:9}   "At that time I said to you, 'I am not able to bear you by myself.
{Deu 1:9}   “那时，我对你们说：‘管理你们的重任，我独自担当不起。
{Deu 1:10}  The LORD your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as numerous as the stars of heaven.
{Deu 1:10}  耶和华你们的神使你们多起来。看哪，你们今日像天上的星那样多。
{Deu 1:11}  May the LORD, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has promised you!
{Deu 1:11}  惟愿耶和华你们列祖的神使你们比如今更多千倍，照他所应许你们的话赐福与你们。
{Deu 1:12}  How can I bear by myself the weight and burden of you and your strife?
{Deu 1:12}  但你们的麻烦，和管理你们的重任，并你们的争讼，我独自一人怎能担当得起呢？
{Deu 1:13}  Choose for your tribes wise, understanding, and experienced men, and I will appoint them as your heads.'
{Deu 1:13}  你们要按着各支派选举有智慧、有见识、为众人所认识的，我立他们为你们的首领。’
{Deu 1:14}  And you answered me, 'The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.'
{Deu 1:14}  你们回答我说：‘照你所说的行了为妙。’
{Deu 1:15}  So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and set them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officers, throughout your tribes.
{Deu 1:15}  我便将你们各支派的首领，有智慧、为众人所认识的，照你们的支派，立他们为官长、千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长，管理你们。
{Deu 1:16}  And I charged your judges at that time, 'Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him.
{Deu 1:16}  “当时，我嘱咐你们的审判官说：‘你们听讼，无论是弟兄彼此争讼，是与同居的外人争讼，都要按公义判断。
{Deu 1:17}  You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God's. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.'
{Deu 1:17}  审判的时候，不可看人的外貌；听讼不可分贵贱，不可惧怕人，因为审判是属乎神的。若有难断的案件，可以呈到我这里，我就判断。’
{Deu 1:18}  And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
{Deu 1:18}  那时，我将你们所当行的事都吩咐你们了。”
{Deu 1:19}  "Then we set out from Horeb and went through all that great and terrifying wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us. And we came to Kadesh-barnea.
{Deu 1:19}  “我们照着耶和华我们神所吩咐的从何烈山起行，经过你们所看见那大而可怕的旷野，往亚摩利人的山地去，到了加低斯巴尼亚。
{Deu 1:20}  And I said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.
{Deu 1:20}  我对你们说：‘你们已经到了耶和华我们神所赐给我们的亚摩利人之山地。
{Deu 1:21}  See, the LORD your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not fear or be dismayed.'
{Deu 1:21}  看哪，耶和华你的神已将那地摆在你面前，你要照耶和华你列祖的神所说的上去得那地为业；不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。’
{Deu 1:22}  Then all of you came near me and said, 'Let us send men before us, that they may explore the land for us and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come.'
{Deu 1:22}  你们都就近我来说：‘我们要先打发人去，为我们窥探那地，将我们上去该走何道，必进何城，都回报我们。’
{Deu 1:23}  The thing seemed good to me, and I took twelve men from you, one man from each tribe.
{Deu 1:23}  这话我以为美，就从你们中间选了十二个人，每支派一人。
{Deu 1:24}  And they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out.
{Deu 1:24}  于是他们起身上山地去，到以实各谷，窥探那地。
{Deu 1:25}  And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and brought us word again and said, 'It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us.'
{Deu 1:25}  他们手里拿着那地的果子下来，到我们那里，回报说：‘耶和华我们的神所赐给我们的是美地。’
{Deu 1:26}  "Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.
{Deu 1:26}  “你们却不肯上去，竟违背了耶和华你们神的命令，
{Deu 1:27}  And you murmured in your tents and said, 'Because the LORD hated us he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
{Deu 1:27}  在帐棚内发怨言说：‘耶和华因为恨我们，所以将我们从埃及地领出来，要交在亚摩利人手中，除灭我们。
{Deu 1:28}  Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, "The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to heaven. And besides, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there."'
{Deu 1:28}  我们上那里去呢？我们的弟兄使我们的心消化，说那地的民比我们又大又高，城邑又广大又坚固，高得顶天，并且我们在那里看见亚衲族的人。’
{Deu 1:29}  Then I said to you, 'Do not be in dread or afraid of them.
{Deu 1:29}  我就对你们说：‘不要惊恐，也不要怕他们。
{Deu 1:30}  The LORD your God who goes before you will himself fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
{Deu 1:30}  在你们前面行的耶和华你们的神必为你们争战，正如他在埃及和旷野，在你们眼前所行的一样。
{Deu 1:31}  and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the LORD your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way that you went until you came to this place.'
{Deu 1:31}  你们在旷野所行的路上，也曾见耶和华你们的神抚养你们，如同人抚养儿子一般，直等你们来到这地方。’
{Deu 1:32}  Yet in spite of this word you did not believe the LORD your God,
{Deu 1:32}  你们在这事上却不信耶和华你们的神。
{Deu 1:33}  who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night and in the cloud by day, to show you by what way you should go.
{Deu 1:33}  他在路上，在你们前面行，为你们找安营的地方；夜间在火柱里，日间在云柱里，指示你们所当行的路。”
{Deu 1:34}  "And the LORD heard your words and was angered, and he swore,
{Deu 1:34}  “耶和华听见你们这话，就发怒，起誓说：
{Deu 1:35}  'Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers,
{Deu 1:35}  ‘这恶世代的人，连一个也不得见我起誓应许赐给你们列祖的美地；
{Deu 1:36}  except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land on which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the LORD!'
{Deu 1:36}  惟有耶孚尼的儿子迦勒必得看见，并且我要将他所踏过的地赐给他和他的子孙，因为他专心跟从我。’
{Deu 1:37}  Even with me the LORD was angry on your account and said, 'You also shall not go in there.
{Deu 1:37}  耶和华为你们的缘故也向我发怒，说：‘你必不得进入那地。
{Deu 1:38}  Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
{Deu 1:38}  伺候你、嫩的儿子约书亚，他必得进入那地；你要勉励他，因为他要使以色列人承受那地为业。
{Deu 1:39}  And as for your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there. And to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.
{Deu 1:39}  并且你们的妇人孩子，就是你们所说、必被掳掠的，和今日不知善恶的儿女，必进入那地。我要将那地赐给他们，他们必得为业。
{Deu 1:40}  But as for you, turn, and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.'
{Deu 1:40}  至于你们，要转回，从红海的路往旷野去。’
{Deu 1:41}  "Then you answered me, 'We have sinned against the LORD. We ourselves will go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.' And every one of you fastened on his weapons of war and thought it easy to go up into the hill country.
{Deu 1:41}  “那时，你们回答我说：‘我们得罪了耶和华，情愿照耶和华我们神一切所吩咐的上去争战。’于是你们各人带着兵器，争先上山地去了。
{Deu 1:42}  And the LORD said to me, 'Say to them, Do not go up or fight, for I am not in your midst, lest you be defeated before your enemies.'
{Deu 1:42}  耶和华吩咐我说：‘你对他们说：不要上去，也不要争战；因我不在你们中间，恐怕你们被仇敌杀败了。’
{Deu 1:43}  So I spoke to you, and you would not listen; but you rebelled against the command of the LORD and presumptuously went up into the hill country.
{Deu 1:43}  我就告诉了你们，你们却不听从，竟违背耶和华的命令，擅自上山地去了。
{Deu 1:44}  Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah.
{Deu 1:44}  住那山地的亚摩利人就出来攻击你们，追赶你们，如蜂拥一般，在西珥杀退你们，直到何珥玛。
{Deu 1:45}  And you returned and wept before the LORD, but the LORD did not listen to your voice or give ear to you.
{Deu 1:45}  你们便回来，在耶和华面前哭号；耶和华却不听你们的声音，也不向你们侧耳。
{Deu 1:46}  So you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained there.
{Deu 1:46}  于是你们在加低斯住了许多日子。”
{Deu 2:1}   "Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, as the LORD told me. And for many days we traveled around Mount Seir.
{Deu 2:1}   “此后，我们转回，从红海的路往旷野去，是照耶和华所吩咐我的。我们在西珥山绕行了许多日子。
{Deu 2:2}   Then the LORD said to me,
{Deu 2:2}   耶和华对我说：
{Deu 2:3}   'You have been traveling around this mountain country long enough. Turn northward
{Deu 2:3}   ‘你们绕行这山的日子够了，要转向北去。
{Deu 2:4}   and command the people, "You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful.
{Deu 2:4}   你吩咐百姓说：你们弟兄以扫的子孙住在西珥，你们要经过他们的境界。他们必惧怕你们，所以你们要分外谨慎。
{Deu 2:5}   Do not contend with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.
{Deu 2:5}   不可与他们争战；他们的地，连脚掌可踏之处，我都不给你们，因我已将西珥山赐给以扫为业。
{Deu 2:6}   You shall purchase food from them with money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink.
{Deu 2:6}   你们要用钱向他们买粮吃，也要用钱向他们买水喝。
{Deu 2:7}   For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He knows your going through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing."'
{Deu 2:7}   因为耶和华你的神在你手里所办的一切事上已赐福与你。你走这大旷野，他都知道了。这四十年，耶和华你的神常与你同在，故此你一无所缺。’
{Deu 2:8}   So we went on, away from our brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber. "And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab.
{Deu 2:8}   “于是，我们离了我们弟兄以扫子孙所住的西珥，从亚拉巴的路，经过以拉他、以旬迦别，转向摩押旷野的路去。
{Deu 2:9}   And the LORD said to me, 'Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the people of Lot for a possession.'
{Deu 2:9}   耶和华吩咐我说：‘不可扰害摩押人，也不可与他们争战。他们的地，我不赐给你为业，因我已将亚珥赐给罗得的子孙为业。’
{Deu 2:10}  (The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim.
{Deu 2:10}  （先前，有以米人住在那里，民数众多，身体高大，像亚衲人一样。
{Deu 2:11}  Like the Anakim they are also counted as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim.
{Deu 2:11}  这以米人像亚衲人；也算为利乏音人；摩押人称他们为以米人。
{Deu 2:12}  The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the LORD gave to them.)
{Deu 2:12}  先前，何利人也住在西珥，但以扫的子孙将他们除灭，得了他们的地，接着居住，就如以色列在耶和华赐给他为业之地所行的一样。）
{Deu 2:13}  'Now rise up and go over the brook Zered.' So we went over the brook Zered.
{Deu 2:13}  现在，起来过撒烈溪！于是我们过了撒烈溪。
{Deu 2:14}  And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.
{Deu 2:14}  自从离开加低斯巴尼亚，到过了撒烈溪的时候，共有三十八年，等那世代的兵丁都从营中灭尽，正如耶和华向他们所起的誓。
{Deu 2:15}  For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the camp, until they had perished.
{Deu 2:15}  耶和华的手也攻击他们，将他们从营中除灭，直到灭尽。
{Deu 2:16}  "So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people,
{Deu 2:16}  “兵丁从民中都灭尽死亡以后，
{Deu 2:17}  the LORD said to me,
{Deu 2:17}  耶和华吩咐我说：
{Deu 2:18}  'Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar.
{Deu 2:18}  ‘你今天要从摩押的境界亚珥经过，
{Deu 2:19}  And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon, do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.'
{Deu 2:19}  走近亚扪人之地，不可扰害他们，也不可与他们争战。亚扪人的地，我不赐给你们为业，因我已将那地赐给罗得的子孙为业。’
{Deu 2:20}  (It is also counted as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there--but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim--
{Deu 2:20}  （那地也算为利乏音人之地，先前利乏音人住在那里，亚扪人称他们为散送冥。
{Deu 2:21}  a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before the Ammonites, and they dispossessed them and settled in their place,
{Deu 2:21}  那民众多，身体高大，像亚衲人一样，但耶和华从亚扪人面前除灭他们，亚扪人就得了他们的地，接着居住。
{Deu 2:22}  as he did for the people of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day.
{Deu 2:22}  正如耶和华从前为住西珥的以扫子孙将何利人从他们面前除灭、他们得了何利人的地、接着居住一样，直到今日。
{Deu 2:23}  As for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)
{Deu 2:23}  从迦斐托出来的迦斐托人将先前住在乡村直到迦萨的亚卫人除灭，接着居住。）
{Deu 2:24}  'Rise up, set out on your journey and go over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession, and contend with him in battle.
{Deu 2:24}  你们起来前往，过亚嫩谷；我已将亚摩利人希实本王西宏和他的地交在你手中，你要与他争战，得他的地为业。
{Deu 2:25}  This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.'
{Deu 2:25}  从今日起，我要使天下万民听见你的名声都惊恐惧怕，且因你发颤伤恸。”
{Deu 2:26}  "So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,
{Deu 2:26}  “我从基底莫的旷野差遣使者去见希实本王西宏，用和睦的话说：
{Deu 2:27}  'Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left.
{Deu 2:27}  ‘求你容我从你的地经过，只走大道，不偏左右。
{Deu 2:28}  You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink. Only let me pass through on foot,
{Deu 2:28}  你可以卖粮给我吃，也可以卖水给我喝，只要容我步行过去，
{Deu 2:29}  as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving to us.'
{Deu 2:29}  就如住西珥的以扫子孙和住亚珥的摩押人待我一样，等我过了约但河，好进入耶和华我们神所赐给我们的地。’
{Deu 2:30}  But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might give him into your hand, as he is this day.
{Deu 2:30}  但希实本王西宏不容我们从他那里经过；因为耶和华你的神使他心中刚硬，性情顽梗，为要将他交在你手中，像今日一样。
{Deu 2:31}  And the LORD said to me, 'Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession, that you may occupy his land.'
{Deu 2:31}  耶和华对我说：‘从此起首，我要将西宏和他的地交给你；你要得他的地为业。’
{Deu 2:32}  Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.
{Deu 2:32}  那时，西宏和他的众民出来攻击我们，在雅杂与我们交战。
{Deu 2:33}  And the LORD our God gave him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and all his people.
{Deu 2:33}  耶和华我们的神将他交给我们，我们就把他和他的儿子，并他的众民，都击杀了。
{Deu 2:34}  And we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction every city, men, women, and children. We left no survivors.
{Deu 2:34}  我们夺了他的一切城邑，将有人烟的各城，连女人带孩子，尽都毁灭，没有留下一个。
{Deu 2:35}  Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities that we captured.
{Deu 2:35}  惟有牲畜和所夺的各城，并其中的财物，都取为自己的掠物。
{Deu 2:36}  From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. The LORD our God gave all into our hands.
{Deu 2:36}  从亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥和谷中的城，直到基列，耶和华我们的神都交给我们了，没有一座城高得使我们不能攻取的。
{Deu 2:37}  Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, whatever the LORD our God had forbidden us.
{Deu 2:37}  惟有亚扪人之地，凡靠近雅博河的地，并山地的城邑，与耶和华我们神所禁止我们去的地方，都没有挨近。”
{Deu 3:1}   "Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
{Deu 3:1}   “以后，我们转回，向巴珊去。巴珊王噩和他的众民都出来，在以得来与我们交战。
{Deu 3:2}   But the LORD said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.'
{Deu 3:2}   耶和华对我说：‘不要怕他！因我已将他和他的众民，并他的地，都交在你手中；你要待他像从前待住希实本的亚摩利王西宏一样。’
{Deu 3:3}   So the LORD our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we struck him down until he had no survivor left.
{Deu 3:3}   于是耶和华我们的神也将巴珊王噩和他的众民都交在我们手中；我们杀了他们，没有留下一个。
{Deu 3:4}   And we took all his cities at that time--there was not a city that we did not take from them--sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
{Deu 3:4}   那时，我们夺了他所有的城，共有六十座，没有一座城不被我们所夺。这为亚珥歌伯的全境，就是巴珊地噩王的国。
{Deu 3:5}   All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages.
{Deu 3:5}   这些城都有坚固的高墙，有门有闩。此外还有许多无城墙的乡村。
{Deu 3:6}   And we devoted them to destruction, as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every city, men, women, and children.
{Deu 3:6}   我们将这些都毁灭了，像从前待希实本王西宏一样，把有人烟的各城，连女人带孩子，尽都毁灭；
{Deu 3:7}   But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder.
{Deu 3:7}   惟有一切牲畜和城中的财物都取为自己的掠物。
{Deu 3:8}   So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon
{Deu 3:8}   那时，我们从约但河东两个亚摩利王的手将亚嫩谷直到黑门山之地夺过来
{Deu 3:9}   (the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir),
{Deu 3:9}   （这黑门山，西顿人称为西连，亚摩利人称为示尼珥），
{Deu 3:10}  all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
{Deu 3:10}  就是夺了平原的各城、基列全地、巴珊全地，直到撒迦和以得来，都是巴珊王噩国内的城邑。
{Deu 3:11}  (For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bed was a bed of iron. Is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the common cubit.)
{Deu 3:11}  （利乏音人所剩下的只有巴珊王噩。他的床是铁的，长九肘，宽四肘，都是以人肘为度。现今岂不是在亚扪人的拉巴吗？）”
{Deu 3:12}  "When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning at Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities.
{Deu 3:12}  “那时，我们得了这地。从亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥起，我将基列山地的一半，并其中的城邑，都给了流便人和迦得人。
{Deu 3:13}  The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All that portion of Bashan is called the land of Rephaim.
{Deu 3:13}  其余的基列地和巴珊全地，就是噩王的国，我给了玛拿西半支派。亚珥歌伯全地乃是巴珊全地；这叫做利乏音人之地。
{Deu 3:14}  Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called the villages after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)
{Deu 3:14}  玛拿西的子孙睚珥占了亚珥歌伯全境，直到基述人和玛迦人的交界，就按自己的名称这巴珊地为哈倭特睚珥，直到今日。
{Deu 3:15}  To Machir I gave Gilead,
{Deu 3:15}  我又将基列给了玛吉。
{Deu 3:16}  and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a border, as far over as the river Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites;
{Deu 3:16}  从基列到亚嫩谷，以谷中为界，直到亚扪人交界的雅博河，我给了流便人和迦得人，
{Deu 3:17}  the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.
{Deu 3:17}  又将亚拉巴和靠近约但河之地，从基尼烈直到亚拉巴海，就是盐海，并毗斯迦山根东边之地，都给了他们。
{Deu 3:18}  "And I commanded you at that time, saying, 'The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of valor shall cross over armed before your brothers, the people of Israel.
{Deu 3:18}  “那时，我吩咐你们说：‘耶和华你们的神已将这地赐给你们为业；你们所有的勇士都要带着兵器，在你们的弟兄以色列人前面过去。
{Deu 3:19}  Only your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in the cities that I have given you,
{Deu 3:19}  但你们的妻子、孩子、牲畜（我知道你们有许多的牲畜）可以住在我所赐给你们的各城里。
{Deu 3:20}  until the LORD gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also occupy the land that the LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.'
{Deu 3:20}  等到你们弟兄在约但河那边，也得耶和华你们神所赐给他们的地，又使他们得享平安，与你们一样，你们才可以回到我所赐给你们为业之地。’
{Deu 3:21}  And I commanded Joshua at that time, 'Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. So will the LORD do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing.
{Deu 3:21}  那时我吩咐约书亚说：‘你亲眼看见了耶和华你神向这二王所行的；耶和华也必向你所要去的各国照样行。
{Deu 3:22}  You shall not fear them, for it is the LORD your God who fights for you.'
{Deu 3:22}  你不要怕他们，因那为你争战的是耶和华你的神。’”
{Deu 3:23}  "And I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying,
{Deu 3:23}  “那时，我恳求耶和华说：
{Deu 3:24}  'O Lord GOD, you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours?
{Deu 3:24}  ‘主耶和华啊，你已将你的大力大能显给仆人看。在天上，在地下，有什么神能像你行事、像你有大能的作为呢？
{Deu 3:25}  Please let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.'
{Deu 3:25}  求你容我过去，看约但河那边的美地，就是那佳美的山地和利巴嫩。’
{Deu 3:26}  But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. And the LORD said to me, 'Enough from you; do not speak to me of this matter again.
{Deu 3:26}  但耶和华因你们的缘故向我发怒，不应允我，对我说：‘罢了！你不要向我再提这事。
{Deu 3:27}  Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and look at it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan.
{Deu 3:27}  你且上毗斯迦山顶去，向东、西、南、北举目观望，因为你必不能过这约但河。
{Deu 3:28}  But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see.'
{Deu 3:28}  你却要嘱咐约书亚，勉励他，使他胆壮；因为他必在这百姓前面过去，使他们承受你所要观看之地。’
{Deu 3:29}  So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
{Deu 3:29}  于是我们住在伯毗珥对面的谷中。”
{Deu 4:1}   "And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the rules that I am teaching you, and do them, that you may live, and go in and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.
{Deu 4:1}   “以色列人哪，现在我所教训你们的律例典章，你们要听从遵行，好叫你们存活，得以进入耶和华你们列祖之神所赐给你们的地，承受为业。
{Deu 4:2}   You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.
{Deu 4:2}   所吩咐你们的话，你们不可加添，也不可删减，好叫你们遵守我所吩咐的，就是耶和华你们神的命令。
{Deu 4:3}   Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed from among you all the men who followed the Baal of Peor.
{Deu 4:3}   耶和华因巴力毗珥的事所行的，你们亲眼看见了。凡随从巴力毗珥的人，耶和华你们的神都从你们中间除灭了。
{Deu 4:4}   But you who held fast to the LORD your God are all alive today.
{Deu 4:4}   惟有你们专靠耶和华你们神的人，今日全都存活。
{Deu 4:5}   See, I have taught you statutes and rules, as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do them in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.
{Deu 4:5}   我照着耶和华我神所吩咐的将律例典章教训你们，使你们在所要进去得为业的地上遵行。
{Deu 4:6}   Keep them and do them, for that will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'
{Deu 4:6}   所以你们要谨守遵行；这就是你们在万民眼前的智慧、聪明。他们听见这一切律例，必说：‘这大国的人真是有智慧，有聪明！’
{Deu 4:7}   For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the LORD our God is to us, whenever we call upon him?
{Deu 4:7}   那一大国的人有神与他们相近，像耶和华我们的神、在我们求告他的时候与我们相近呢？
{Deu 4:8}   And what great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law that I set before you today?
{Deu 4:8}   又那一大国有这样公义的律例典章、像我今日在你们面前所陈明的这一切律法呢？
{Deu 4:9}   "Only take care, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. Make them known to your children and your children's children--
{Deu 4:9}   “你只要谨慎，殷勤保守你的心灵，免得忘记你亲眼所看见的事，又免得你一生、这事离开你的心；总要传给你的子子孙孙。
{Deu 4:10}  how on the day that you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, the LORD said to me, 'Gather the people to me, that I may let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children so.'
{Deu 4:10}  你在何烈山站在耶和华你神面前的那日，耶和华对我说：‘你为我招聚百姓，我要叫他们听见我的话，使他们存活在世的日子，可以学习敬畏我，又可以教训儿女这样行。’
{Deu 4:11}  And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, wrapped in darkness, cloud, and gloom.
{Deu 4:11}  那时你们近前来，站在山下；山上有火焰冲天，并有昏黑、密云、幽暗。
{Deu 4:12}  Then the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of words, but saw no form; there was only a voice.
{Deu 4:12}  耶和华从火焰中对你们说话，你们只听见声音，却没有看见形像。
{Deu 4:13}  And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments, and he wrote them on two tablets of stone.
{Deu 4:13}  他将所吩咐你们当守的约指示你们，就是十条诫，并将这诫写在两块石版上。
{Deu 4:14}  And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and rules, that you might do them in the land that you are going over to possess.
{Deu 4:14}  那时耶和华又吩咐我将律例典章教训你们，使你们在所要过去得为业的地上遵行。”
{Deu 4:15}  "Therefore watch yourselves very carefully. Since you saw no form on the day that the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire,
{Deu 4:15}  “所以，你们要分外谨慎；因为耶和华在何烈山、从火中对你们说话的那日，你们没有看见什么形像。
{Deu 4:16}  beware lest you act corruptly by making a carved image for yourselves, in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
{Deu 4:16}  惟恐你们败坏自己，雕刻偶像，彷佛什么男像女像，
{Deu 4:17}  the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,
{Deu 4:17}  或地上走兽的像，或空中飞鸟的像，
{Deu 4:18}  the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.
{Deu 4:18}  或地上爬物的像，或地底下水中鱼的像。
{Deu 4:19}  And beware lest you raise your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, you be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them, things that the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.
{Deu 4:19}  又恐怕你向天举目观看，见耶和华你的神为天下万民所摆列的日月星，就是天上的万象，自己便被勾引敬拜事奉他。
{Deu 4:20}  But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be a people of his own inheritance, as you are this day.
{Deu 4:20}  耶和华将你们从埃及领出来，脱离铁炉，要特作自己产业的子民，像今日一样。
{Deu 4:21}  Furthermore, the LORD was angry with me because of you, and he swore that I should not cross the Jordan, and that I should not enter the good land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance.
{Deu 4:21}  耶和华又因你们的缘故向我发怒，起誓必不容我过约但河，也不容我进入耶和华你神所赐你为业的那美地。
{Deu 4:22}  For I must die in this land; I must not go over the Jordan. But you shall go over and take possession of that good land.
{Deu 4:22}  我只得死在这地，不能过约但河；但你们必过去得那美地。
{Deu 4:23}  Take care, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make a carved image, the form of anything that the LORD your God has forbidden you.
{Deu 4:23}  你们要谨慎，免得忘记耶和华你们神与你们所立的约，为自己雕刻偶像，就是耶和华你神所禁止你做的偶像；
{Deu 4:24}  For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
{Deu 4:24}  因为耶和华你的神乃是烈火，是忌邪的神。
{Deu 4:25}  "When you father children and children's children, and have grown old in the land, if you act corruptly by making a carved image in the form of anything, and by doing what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, so as to provoke him to anger,
{Deu 4:25}  “你们在那地住久了，生子生孙，就雕刻偶像，彷佛什么形像，败坏自己，行耶和华你神眼中看为恶的事，惹他发怒。
{Deu 4:26}  I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess. You will not live long in it, but will be utterly destroyed.
{Deu 4:26}  我今日呼天唤地向你们作见证，你们必在过约但河得为业的地上速速灭尽！你们不能在那地上长久，必尽行除灭。
{Deu 4:27}  And the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD will drive you.
{Deu 4:27}  耶和华必使你们分散在万民中；在他所领你们到的万国里，你们剩下的人数稀少。
{Deu 4:28}  And there you will serve gods of wood and stone, the work of human hands, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
{Deu 4:28}  在那里，你们必事奉人手所造的神，就是用木石造成、不能看、不能听、不能吃、不能闻的神。
{Deu 4:29}  But from there you will seek the LORD your God and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.
{Deu 4:29}  但你们在那里必寻求耶和华你的神。你尽心尽性寻求他的时候，就必寻见。
{Deu 4:30}  When you are in tribulation, and all these things come upon you in the latter days, you will return to the LORD your God and obey his voice.
{Deu 4:30}  日后你遭遇一切患难的时候，你必归回耶和华你的神，听从他的话。
{Deu 4:31}  For the LORD your God is a merciful God. He will not leave you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers that he swore to them.
{Deu 4:31}  耶和华你神原是有怜悯的神；他总不撇下你，不灭绝你，也不忘记他起誓与你列祖所立的约。
{Deu 4:32}  "For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of.
{Deu 4:32}  “你且考察在你以前的世代，自神造人在世以来，从天这边到天那边，曾有何民听见神在火中说话的声音，像你听见还能存活呢？
{Deu 4:33}  Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live?
{Deu 4:33}  这样的大事何曾有、何曾听见呢？
{Deu 4:34}  Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great deeds of terror, all of which the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
{Deu 4:34}  神何曾从别的国中将一国的人民领出来，用试验、神迹、奇事、争战、大能的手，和伸出来的膀臂，并大可畏的事，像耶和华你们的神在埃及，在你们眼前为你们所行的一切事呢？
{Deu 4:35}  To you it was shown, that you might know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides him.
{Deu 4:35}  这是显给你看，要使你知道，惟有耶和华他是神，除他以外，再无别神。
{Deu 4:36}  Out of heaven he let you hear his voice, that he might discipline you. And on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.
{Deu 4:36}  他从天上使你听见他的声音，为要教训你，又在地上使你看见他的烈火，并且听见他从火中所说的话。
{Deu 4:37}  And because he loved your fathers and chose their offspring after them and brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power,
{Deu 4:37}  因他爱你的列祖，所以拣选他们的后裔，用大能亲自领你出了埃及，
{Deu 4:38}  driving out before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day,
{Deu 4:38}  要将比你强大的国民从你面前赶出，领你进去，将他们的地赐你为业，像今日一样。
{Deu 4:39}  know therefore today, and lay it to your heart, that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.
{Deu 4:39}  所以，今日你要知道，也要记在心上，天上地下惟有耶和华他是神，除他以外，再无别神。
{Deu 4:40}  Therefore you shall keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for all time."
{Deu 4:40}  我今日将他的律例诫命晓谕你，你要遵守，使你和你的子孙可以得福，并使你的日子在耶和华你神所赐的地上得以长久。”
{Deu 4:41}  Then Moses set apart three cities in the east beyond the Jordan,
{Deu 4:41}  “那时，摩西在约但河东，向日出之地，分定三座城，
{Deu 4:42}  that the manslayer might flee there, anyone who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without being at enmity with him in time past; he may flee to one of these cities and save his life:
{Deu 4:42}  使那素无仇恨、无心杀了人的，可以逃到这三城之中的一座城，就得存活：
{Deu 4:43}  Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
{Deu 4:43}  为流便人分定旷野平原的比悉；为迦得人分定基列的拉末；为玛拿西人分定巴珊的哥兰。”
{Deu 4:44}  This is the law that Moses set before the people of Israel.
{Deu 4:44}  摩西在以色列人面前所陈明的律法，
{Deu 4:45}  These are the testimonies, the statutes, and the rules, which Moses spoke to the people of Israel when they came out of Egypt,
{Deu 4:45}  就是摩西在以色列人出埃及后所传给他们的法度、律例、典章；
{Deu 4:46}  beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the people of Israel defeated when they came out of Egypt.
{Deu 4:46}  在约但河东伯毗珥对面的谷中，在住希实本、亚摩利王西宏之地；这西宏是摩西和以色列人出埃及后所击杀的。
{Deu 4:47}  And they took possession of his land and the land of Og, the king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who lived to the east beyond the Jordan;
{Deu 4:47}  他们得了他的地，又得了巴珊王噩的地，就是两个亚摩利王，在约但河东向日出之地。
{Deu 4:48}  from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, as far as Mount Sirion (that is, Hermon),
{Deu 4:48}  从亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥，直到西云山，就是黑门山。
{Deu 4:49}  together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
{Deu 4:49}  还有约但河东的全亚拉巴，直到亚拉巴海，靠近毗斯迦山根。
{Deu 5:1}   And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the rules that I speak in your hearing today, and you shall learn them and be careful to do them.
{Deu 5:1}   摩西将以色列众人召了来，对他们说：“以色列人哪，我今日晓谕你们的律例典章，你们要听，可以学习，谨守遵行。
{Deu 5:2}   The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
{Deu 5:2}   耶和华我们的神在何烈山与我们立约。
{Deu 5:3}   Not with our fathers did the LORD make this covenant, but with us, who are all of us here alive today.
{Deu 5:3}   这约不是与我们列祖立的，乃是与我们今日在这里存活之人立的。
{Deu 5:4}   The LORD spoke with you face to face at the mountain, out of the midst of the fire,
{Deu 5:4}   耶和华在山上，从火中，面对面与你们说话，
{Deu 5:5}   while I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD. For you were afraid because of the fire, and you did not go up into the mountain. He said:
{Deu 5:5}   （那时我站在耶和华和你们中间，要将耶和华的话传给你们；因为你们惧怕那火，没有上山）
{Deu 5:6}   "'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
{Deu 5:6}   说：“‘我是耶和华你的神，曾将你从埃及地为奴之家领出来。
{Deu 5:7}   "'You shall have no other gods before me.
{Deu 5:7}   “‘除了我以外，你不可有别的神。
{Deu 5:8}   "'You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
{Deu 5:8}   “‘不可为自己雕刻偶像，也不可做什么形像，彷佛上天、下地和地底下、水中的百物。
{Deu 5:9}   You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
{Deu 5:9}   不可跪拜那些像，也不可事奉他，因为我耶和华你的神是忌邪的神。恨我的，我必追讨他的罪，自父及子，直到三、四代；
{Deu 5:10}  but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
{Deu 5:10}  爱我、守我诫命的，我必向他们发慈爱，直到千代。
{Deu 5:11}  "'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
{Deu 5:11}  “‘不可妄称耶和华你神的名；因为妄称耶和华名的，耶和华必不以他为无罪。
{Deu 5:12}  "'Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the LORD your God commanded you.
{Deu 5:12}  “‘当照耶和华你神所吩咐的守安息日为圣日。
{Deu 5:13}  Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
{Deu 5:13}  六日要劳碌做你一切的工，
{Deu 5:14}  but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant, or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
{Deu 5:14}  但第七日是向耶和华你神当守的安息日。这一日，你和你的儿女、仆婢、牛、驴、牲畜，并在你城里寄居的客旅，无论何工都不可做，使你的仆婢可以和你一样安息。
{Deu 5:15}  You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
{Deu 5:15}  你也要记念你在埃及地作过奴仆；耶和华你神用大能的手和伸出来的膀臂将你从那里领出来。因此，耶和华你的神吩咐你守安息日。
{Deu 5:16}  "'Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God commanded you, that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
{Deu 5:16}  “‘当照耶和华你神所吩咐的孝敬父母，使你得福，并使你的日子在耶和华你神所赐你的地上得以长久。
{Deu 5:17}  "'You shall not murder.
{Deu 5:17}  “‘不可杀人。
{Deu 5:18}  "'And you shall not commit adultery.
{Deu 5:18}  “‘不可奸淫。
{Deu 5:19}  "'And you shall not steal.
{Deu 5:19}  “‘不可偷盗。
{Deu 5:20}  "'And you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
{Deu 5:20}  “‘不可作假见证陷害人。
{Deu 5:21}  "'And you shall not covet your neighbor's wife. And you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.'
{Deu 5:21}  “‘不可贪恋人的妻子；也不可贪图人的房屋、田地、仆婢、牛、驴，并他一切所有的。’
{Deu 5:22}  "These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and he added no more. And he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
{Deu 5:22}  “这些话是耶和华在山上，从火中、云中、幽暗中，大声晓谕你们全会众的；此外并没有添别的话。他就把这话写在两块石版上，交给我了。”
{Deu 5:23}  And as soon as you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders.
{Deu 5:23}  “那时，火焰烧山，你们听见从黑暗中出来的声音；你们支派中所有的首领和长老都来就近我，
{Deu 5:24}  And you said, 'Behold, the LORD our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire. This day we have seen God speak with man, and man still live.
{Deu 5:24}  说：‘看哪，耶和华我们神将他的荣光和他的大能显给我们看，我们又听见他的声音从火中出来。今日我们得见神与人说话，人还存活。
{Deu 5:25}  Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, we shall die.
{Deu 5:25}  现在这大火将要烧灭我们，我们何必冒死呢？若再听见耶和华我们神的声音就必死亡。
{Deu 5:26}  For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of fire as we have, and has still lived?
{Deu 5:26}  凡属血气的，曾有何人听见永生神的声音从火中出来，像我们听见还能存活呢？
{Deu 5:27}  Go near and hear all that the LORD our God will say, and speak to us all that the LORD our God will speak to you, and we will hear and do it.'
{Deu 5:27}  求你近前去，听耶和华我们神所要说的一切话，将他对你说的话都传给我们，我们就听从遵行。’
{Deu 5:28}  "And the LORD heard your words, when you spoke to me. And the LORD said to me, 'I have heard the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They are right in all that they have spoken.
{Deu 5:28}  “你们对我说的话，耶和华都听见了。耶和华对我说：‘这百姓的话，我听见了；他们所说的都是。
{Deu 5:29}  Oh that they had such a heart as this always, to fear me and to keep all my commandments, that it might go well with them and with their descendants forever!
{Deu 5:29}  惟愿他们存这样的心敬畏我，常遵守我的一切诫命，使他们和他们的子孙永远得福。
{Deu 5:30}  Go and say to them, "Return to your tents."
{Deu 5:30}  你去对他们说：你们回帐棚去吧！
{Deu 5:31}  But you, stand here by me, and I will tell you the whole commandment and the statutes and the rules that you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land that I am giving them to possess.'
{Deu 5:31}  至于你，可以站在我这里，我要将一切诫命、律例、典章传给你；你要教训他们，使他们在我赐他们为业的地上遵行。’
{Deu 5:32}  You shall be careful therefore to do as the LORD your God has commanded you. You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
{Deu 5:32}  所以，你们要照耶和华你们神所吩咐的谨守遵行，不可偏离左右。
{Deu 5:33}  You shall walk in all the way that the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may go well with you, and that you may live long in the land that you shall possess.
{Deu 5:33}  耶和华你们神所吩咐你们行的，你们都要去行，使你们可以存活得福，并使你们的日子在所要承受的地上得以长久。”
{Deu 6:1}   "Now this is the commandment--the statutes and the rules--that the LORD your God commanded me to teach you, that you may do them in the land to which you are going over, to possess it,
{Deu 6:1}   “这是耶和华你们神所吩咐教训你们的诫命、律例、典章，使你们在所要过去得为业的地上遵行，
{Deu 6:2}   that you may fear the LORD your God, you and your son and your son's son, by keeping all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be long.
{Deu 6:2}   好叫你和你子子孙孙一生敬畏耶和华你的神，谨守他的一切律例诫命，就是我所吩咐你的，使你的日子得以长久。
{Deu 6:3}   Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
{Deu 6:3}   以色列啊，你要听，要谨守遵行，使你可以在那流奶与蜜之地得以享福，人数极其增多，正如耶和华你列祖的神所应许你的。
{Deu 6:4}   "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.
{Deu 6:4}   “以色列啊，你要听！耶和华我们神是独一的主。
{Deu 6:5}   You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.
{Deu 6:5}   你要尽心、尽性、尽力爱耶和华你的神。
{Deu 6:6}   And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.
{Deu 6:6}   我今日所吩咐你的话都要记在心上，
{Deu 6:7}   You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.
{Deu 6:7}   也要殷勤教训你的儿女。无论你坐在家里，行在路上，躺下，起来，都要谈论。
{Deu 6:8}   You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
{Deu 6:8}   也要系在手上为记号，戴在额上为经文；
{Deu 6:9}   You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
{Deu 6:9}   又要写在你房屋的门框上，并你的城门上。”
{Deu 6:10}  "And when the LORD your God brings you into the land that he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you--with great and good cities that you did not build,
{Deu 6:10}  “耶和华你的神领你进他向你列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓应许给你的地。那里有城邑，又大又美，非你所建造的；
{Deu 6:11}  and houses full of all good things that you did not fill, and cisterns that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant--and when you eat and are full,
{Deu 6:11}  有房屋，装满各样美物，非你所装满的；有凿成的水井，非你所凿成的；还有葡萄园、橄榄园，非你所栽种的；你吃了而且饱足。
{Deu 6:12}  then take care lest you forget the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
{Deu 6:12}  那时你要谨慎，免得你忘记将你从埃及地、为奴之家领出来的耶和华。
{Deu 6:13}  It is the LORD your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear.
{Deu 6:13}  你要敬畏耶和华你的神，事奉他，指着他的名起誓。
{Deu 6:14}  You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are around you--
{Deu 6:14}  不可随从别神，就是你们四围国民的神；
{Deu 6:15}  for the LORD your God in your midst is a jealous God--lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.
{Deu 6:15}  因为在你们中间的耶和华你神是忌邪的神，惟恐耶和华你神的怒气向你发作，就把你从地上除灭。
{Deu 6:16}  "You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah.
{Deu 6:16}  “你们不可试探耶和华你们的神，像你们在玛撒那样试探他。
{Deu 6:17}  You shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies and his statutes, which he has commanded you.
{Deu 6:17}  要留意遵守耶和华你们神所吩咐的诫命、法度、律例。
{Deu 6:18}  And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, that it may go well with you, and that you may go in and take possession of the good land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers
{Deu 6:18}  耶和华眼中看为正、看为善的，你都要遵行，使你可以享福，并可以进去得耶和华向你列祖起誓应许的那美地，
{Deu 6:19}  by thrusting out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has promised.
{Deu 6:19}  照耶和华所说的，从你面前撵出你的一切仇敌。
{Deu 6:20}  "When your son asks you in time to come, 'What is the meaning of the testimonies and the statutes and the rules that the LORD our God has commanded you?'
{Deu 6:20}  “日后，你的儿子问你说：‘耶和华我们神吩咐你们的这些法度、律例、典章是什么意思呢？’
{Deu 6:21}  then you shall say to your son, 'We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt. And the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
{Deu 6:21}  你就告诉你的儿子说：‘我们在埃及作过法老的奴仆；耶和华用大能的手将我们从埃及领出来，
{Deu 6:22}  And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and grievous, against Egypt and against Pharaoh and all his household, before our eyes.
{Deu 6:22}  在我们眼前，将重大可怕的神迹奇事施行在埃及地和法老并他全家的身上，
{Deu 6:23}  And he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in and give us the land that he swore to give to our fathers.
{Deu 6:23}  将我们从那里领出来，要领我们进入他向我们列祖起誓应许之地，把这地赐给我们。
{Deu 6:24}  And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as we are this day.
{Deu 6:24}  耶和华又吩咐我们遵行这一切律例，要敬畏耶和华我们的神，使我们常得好处，蒙他保全我们的生命，像今日一样。
{Deu 6:25}  And it will be righteousness for us, if we are careful to do all this commandment before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us.'
{Deu 6:25}  我们若照耶和华我们神所吩咐的一切诫命谨守遵行，这就是我们的义了。’”
{Deu 7:1}   "When the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations more numerous and mightier than you,
{Deu 7:1}   “耶和华你神领你进入要得为业之地，从你面前赶出许多国民，就是赫人、革迦撒人、亚摩利人、迦南人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人，共七国的民，都比你强大。
{Deu 7:2}   and when the LORD your God gives them over to you, and you defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction. You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them.
{Deu 7:2}   耶和华你神将他们交给你击杀，那时你要把他们灭绝净尽，不可与他们立约，也不可怜恤他们。
{Deu 7:3}   You shall not intermarry with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons,
{Deu 7:3}   不可与他们结亲。不可将你的女儿嫁他们的儿子，也不可叫你的儿子娶他们的女儿；
{Deu 7:4}   for they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods. Then the anger of the LORD would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.
{Deu 7:4}   因为他必使你儿子转离不跟从主，去事奉别神，以致耶和华的怒气向你们发作，就速速地将你们灭绝。
{Deu 7:5}   But thus shall you deal with them: you shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and chop down their Asherim and burn their carved images with fire.
{Deu 7:5}   你们却要这样待他们：拆毁他们的祭坛，打碎他们的柱像，砍下他们的木偶，用火焚烧他们雕刻的偶像。
{Deu 7:6}   "For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
{Deu 7:6}   因为你归耶和华你神为圣洁的民；耶和华你神从地上的万民中拣选你，特作自己的子民。
{Deu 7:7}   It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples,
{Deu 7:7}   “耶和华专爱你们，拣选你们，并非因你们的人数多于别民，原来你们的人数在万民中是最少的。
{Deu 7:8}   but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
{Deu 7:8}   只因耶和华爱你们，又因要守他向你们列祖所起的誓，就用大能的手领你们出来，从为奴之家救赎你们脱离埃及王法老的手。
{Deu 7:9}   Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,
{Deu 7:9}   所以，你要知道耶和华你的神，他是神，是信实的神；向爱他、守他诫命的人守约，施慈爱，直到千代；
{Deu 7:10}  and repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them. He will not be slack with one who hates him. He will repay him to his face.
{Deu 7:10}  向恨他的人当面报应他们，将他们灭绝。凡恨他的人必报应他们，决不迟延。
{Deu 7:11}  You shall therefore be careful to do the commandment and the statutes and the rules that I command you today.
{Deu 7:11}  所以，你要谨守遵行我今日所吩咐你的诫命、律例、典章。”
{Deu 7:12}  "And because you listen to these rules and keep and do them, the LORD your God will keep with you the covenant and the steadfast love that he swore to your fathers.
{Deu 7:12}  “你们果然听从这些典章，谨守遵行，耶和华你神就必照他向你列祖所起的誓守约，施慈爱。
{Deu 7:13}  He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock, in the land that he swore to your fathers to give you.
{Deu 7:13}  他必爱你，赐福与你，使你人数增多，也必在他向你列祖起誓应许给你的地上赐福与你身所生的，地所产的，并你的五谷、新酒，和油，以及牛犊、羊羔。
{Deu 7:14}  You shall be blessed above all peoples. There shall not be male or female barren among you or among your livestock.
{Deu 7:14}  你必蒙福胜过万民；你们的男女没有不能生养的，牲畜也没有不能生育的。
{Deu 7:15}  And the LORD will take away from you all sickness, and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you knew, will he inflict on you, but he will lay them on all who hate you.
{Deu 7:15}  耶和华必使一切的病症离开你；你所知道埃及各样的恶疾，他不加在你身上，只加在一切恨你的人身上。
{Deu 7:16}  And you shall consume all the peoples that the LORD your God will give over to you. Your eye shall not pity them, neither shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.
{Deu 7:16}  耶和华你神所要交给你的一切人民，你要将他们除灭；你眼不可顾惜他们。你也不可事奉他们的神，因这必成为你的网罗。
{Deu 7:17}  "If you say in your heart, 'These nations are greater than I. How can I dispossess them?'
{Deu 7:17}  “你若心里说，这些国的民比我更多，我怎能赶出他们呢？
{Deu 7:18}  you shall not be afraid of them but you shall remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt,
{Deu 7:18}  你不要惧怕他们，要牢牢记念耶和华你神向法老和埃及全地所行的事，
{Deu 7:19}  the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the LORD your God brought you out. So will the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
{Deu 7:19}  就是你亲眼所看见的大试验、神迹、奇事，和大能的手，并伸出来的膀臂，都是耶和华你神领你出来所用的。耶和华你神必照样待你所惧怕的一切人民。
{Deu 7:20}  Moreover, the LORD your God will send hornets among them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you are destroyed.
{Deu 7:20}  并且耶和华你神必打发黄蜂飞到他们中间，直到那剩下而藏躲的人从你面前灭亡。
{Deu 7:21}  You shall not be in dread of them, for the LORD your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God.
{Deu 7:21}  你不要因他们惊恐，因为耶和华你神在你们中间是大而可畏的神。
{Deu 7:22}  The LORD your God will clear away these nations before you little by little. You may not make an end of them at once, lest the wild beasts grow too numerous for you.
{Deu 7:22}  耶和华你神必将这些国的民从你面前渐渐赶出；你不可把他们速速灭尽，恐怕野地的兽多起来害你。
{Deu 7:23}  But the LORD your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion, until they are destroyed.
{Deu 7:23}  耶和华你神必将他们交给你，大大的扰乱他们，直到他们灭绝了；
{Deu 7:24}  And he will give their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under heaven. No one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them.
{Deu 7:24}  又要将他们的君王交在你手中，你就使他们的名从天下消灭。必无一人能在你面前站立得住，直到你将他们灭绝了。
{Deu 7:25}  The carved images of their gods you shall burn with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them or take it for yourselves, lest you be ensnared by it, for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.
{Deu 7:25}  他们雕刻的神像，你们要用火焚烧；其上的金银，你不可贪图，也不可收取，免得你因此陷入网罗；这原是耶和华你神所憎恶的。
{Deu 7:26}  And you shall not bring an abominable thing into your house and become devoted to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest and abhor it, for it is devoted to destruction.
{Deu 7:26}  可憎的物，你不可带进家去；不然，你就成了当毁灭的，与那物一样。你要十分厌恶，十分憎嫌，因为这是当毁灭的物。”
{Deu 8:1}   "The whole commandment that I command you today you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers.
{Deu 8:1}   “我今日所吩咐的一切诫命，你们要谨守遵行，好叫你们存活，人数增多，且进去得耶和华向你们列祖起誓应许的那地。
{Deu 8:2}   And you shall remember the whole way that the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not.
{Deu 8:2}   你也要记念耶和华你的神在旷野引导你这四十年，是要苦炼你，试验你，要知道你心内如何，肯守他的诫命不肯。
{Deu 8:3}   And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.
{Deu 8:3}   他苦炼你，任你饥饿，将你和你列祖所不认识的吗哪赐给你吃，使你知道，人活着不是单靠食物，乃是靠耶和华口里所出的一切话。
{Deu 8:4}   Your clothing did not wear out on you and your foot did not swell these forty years.
{Deu 8:4}   这四十年，你的衣服没有穿破，你的脚也没有肿。
{Deu 8:5}   Know then in your heart that, as a man disciplines his son, the LORD your God disciplines you.
{Deu 8:5}   你当心里思想，耶和华你神管教你，好像人管教儿子一样。
{Deu 8:6}   So you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him.
{Deu 8:6}   你要谨守耶和华你神的诫命，遵行他的道，敬畏他。
{Deu 8:7}   For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing out in the valleys and hills,
{Deu 8:7}   因为耶和华你神领你进入美地，那地有河，有泉，有源，从山谷中流出水来。
{Deu 8:8}   a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey,
{Deu 8:8}   那地有小麦、大麦、葡萄树、无花果树、石榴树、橄榄树，和蜜。
{Deu 8:9}   a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper.
{Deu 8:9}   你在那地不缺食物，一无所缺。那地的石头是铁，山内可以挖铜。
{Deu 8:10}  And you shall eat and be full, and you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land he has given you.
{Deu 8:10}  你吃得饱足，就要称颂耶和华你的神，因他将那美地赐给你了。”
{Deu 8:11}  "Take care lest you forget the LORD your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules and his statutes, which I command you today,
{Deu 8:11}  “你要谨慎，免得忘记耶和华你的神，不守他的诫命、典章、律例，就是我今日所吩咐你的；
{Deu 8:12}  lest, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and live in them,
{Deu 8:12}  恐怕你吃得饱足，建造美好的房屋居住，
{Deu 8:13}  and when your herds and flocks multiply and your silver and gold is multiplied and all that you have is multiplied,
{Deu 8:13}  你的牛羊加多，你的金银增添，并你所有的全都加增，
{Deu 8:14}  then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,
{Deu 8:14}  你就心高气傲，忘记耶和华你的神，就是将你从埃及地为奴之家领出来的，
{Deu 8:15}  who led you through the great and terrifying wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water, who brought you water out of the flinty rock,
{Deu 8:15}  引你经过那大而可怕的旷野，那里有火蛇、蝎子、干旱无水之地。他曾为你使水从坚硬的磐石中流出来，
{Deu 8:16}  who fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers did not know, that he might humble you and test you, to do you good in the end.
{Deu 8:16}  又在旷野将你列祖所不认识的吗哪赐给你吃，是要苦炼你，试验你，叫你终久享福；
{Deu 8:17}  Beware lest you say in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth.'
{Deu 8:17}  恐怕你心里说：‘这货财是我力量、我能力得来的。’
{Deu 8:18}  You shall remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.
{Deu 8:18}  你要记念耶和华你的神，因为得货财的力量是他给你的，为要坚定他向你列祖起誓所立的约，像今日一样。
{Deu 8:19}  And if you forget the LORD your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish.
{Deu 8:19}  你若忘记耶和华你的神，随从别神，事奉敬拜，你们必定灭亡；这是我今日警戒你们的。
{Deu 8:20}  Like the nations that the LORD makes to perish before you, so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.
{Deu 8:20}  耶和华在你们面前怎样使列国的民灭亡，你们也必照样灭亡，因为你们不听从耶和华你们神的话。”
{Deu 9:1}   "Hear, O Israel: you are to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, cities great and fortified up to heaven,
{Deu 9:1}   “以色列啊，你当听！你今日要过约但河，进去赶出比你强大的国民，得着广大坚固、高得顶天的城邑。
{Deu 9:2}   a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, 'Who can stand before the sons of Anak?'
{Deu 9:2}   那民是亚衲族的人，又大又高，是你所知道的；也曾听见有人指着他们说：‘谁能在亚衲族人面前站立得住呢？’
{Deu 9:3}   Know therefore today that he who goes over before you as a consuming fire is the LORD your God. He will destroy them and subdue them before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as the LORD has promised you.
{Deu 9:3}   你今日当知道，耶和华你的神在你前面过去，如同烈火，要灭绝他们，将他们制伏在你面前。这样，你就要照耶和华所说的赶出他们，使他们速速灭亡。
{Deu 9:4}   "Do not say in your heart, after the LORD your God has thrust them out before you, 'It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has brought me in to possess this land,' whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out before you.
{Deu 9:4}   “耶和华你的神将这些国民从你面前撵出以后，你心里不可说：‘耶和华将我领进来得这地是因我的义。’其实，耶和华将他们从你面前赶出去是因他们的恶。
{Deu 9:5}   Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God is driving them out from before you, and that he may confirm the word that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
{Deu 9:5}   你进去得他们的地，并不是因你的义，也不是因你心里正直，乃是因这些国民的恶，耶和华你的神将他们从你面前赶出去，又因耶和华要坚定他向你列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓所应许的话。
{Deu 9:6}   "Know, therefore, that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stubborn people.
{Deu 9:6}   “你当知道，耶和华你神将这美地赐你为业，并不是因你的义；你本是硬着颈项的百姓。
{Deu 9:7}   Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD.
{Deu 9:7}   你当记念不忘，你在旷野怎样惹耶和华你神发怒。自从你出了埃及地的那日，直到你们来到这地方，你们时常悖逆耶和华。
{Deu 9:8}   Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you.
{Deu 9:8}   你们在何烈山又惹耶和华发怒；他恼怒你们，要灭绝你们。
{Deu 9:9}   When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.
{Deu 9:9}   我上了山，要领受两块石版，就是耶和华与你们立约的版。那时我在山上住了四十昼夜，没有吃饭，也没有喝水。
{Deu 9:10}  And the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words that the LORD had spoken with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.
{Deu 9:10}  耶和华把那两块石版交给我，是神用指头写的。版上所写的是照耶和华在大会的日子、在山上、从火中对你们所说的一切话。
{Deu 9:11}  And at the end of forty days and forty nights the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.
{Deu 9:11}  过了四十昼夜，耶和华把那两块石版，就是约版，交给我。
{Deu 9:12}  Then the LORD said to me, 'Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made themselves a metal image.'
{Deu 9:12}  对我说：‘你起来，赶快下去！因为你从埃及领出来的百姓已经败坏了自己；他们快快地偏离了我所吩咐的道，为自己铸成了偶像。’
{Deu 9:13}  "Furthermore, the LORD said to me, 'I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stubborn people.
{Deu 9:13}  “耶和华又对我说：‘我看这百姓是硬着颈项的百姓。
{Deu 9:14}  Let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.'
{Deu 9:14}  你且由着我，我要灭绝他们，将他们的名从天下涂抹，使你的后裔比他们成为更大更强的国。’
{Deu 9:15}  So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
{Deu 9:15}  于是我转身下山，山被火烧着，两块约版在我两手之中。
{Deu 9:16}  And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the LORD your God. You had made yourselves a golden calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you.
{Deu 9:16}  我一看见你们得罪了耶和华你们的神，铸成了牛犊，快快地偏离了耶和华所吩咐你们的道，
{Deu 9:17}  So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.
{Deu 9:17}  我就把那两块版从我手中扔下去，在你们眼前摔碎了。
{Deu 9:18}  Then I lay prostrate before the LORD as before, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin that you had committed, in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to anger.
{Deu 9:18}  因你们所犯的一切罪，行了耶和华眼中看为恶的事，惹他发怒，我就像从前俯伏在耶和华面前四十昼夜，没有吃饭，也没有喝水。
{Deu 9:19}  For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure that the LORD bore against you, so that he was ready to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me that time also.
{Deu 9:19}  我因耶和华向你们大发烈怒，要灭绝你们，就甚害怕；但那次耶和华又应允了我。
{Deu 9:20}  And the LORD was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him. And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
{Deu 9:20}  耶和华也向亚伦甚是发怒，要灭绝他；那时我又为亚伦祈祷。
{Deu 9:21}  Then I took the sinful thing, the calf that you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. And I threw the dust of it into the brook that ran down from the mountain.
{Deu 9:21}  我把那叫你们犯罪所铸的牛犊用火焚烧，又捣碎磨得很细，以致细如灰尘，我就把这灰尘撒在从山上流下来的溪水中。
{Deu 9:22}  "At Taberah also, and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath.
{Deu 9:22}  “你们在他备拉、玛撒、基博罗哈他瓦又惹耶和华发怒。
{Deu 9:23}  And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, 'Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,' then you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God and did not believe him or obey his voice.
{Deu 9:23}  耶和华打发你们离开加低斯巴尼亚，说：‘你们上去得我所赐给你们的地。’那时你们违背了耶和华你们神的命令，不信服他，不听从他的话。
{Deu 9:24}  You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
{Deu 9:24}  自从我认识你们以来，你们常常悖逆耶和华。
{Deu 9:25}  "So I lay prostrate before the LORD for these forty days and forty nights, because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
{Deu 9:25}  “我因耶和华说要灭绝你们，就在耶和华面前照旧俯伏四十昼夜。
{Deu 9:26}  And I prayed to the LORD, 'O Lord GOD, do not destroy your people and your heritage, whom you have redeemed through your greatness, whom you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
{Deu 9:26}  我祈祷耶和华说：‘主耶和华啊，求你不要灭绝你的百姓。他们是你的产业，是你用大力救赎的，用大能从埃及领出来的。
{Deu 9:27}  Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness or their sin,
{Deu 9:27}  求你记念你的仆人亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，不要想念这百姓的顽梗、邪恶、罪过，
{Deu 9:28}  lest the land from which you brought us say, "Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness."
{Deu 9:28}  免得你领我们出来的那地之人说，耶和华因为不能将这百姓领进他所应许之地，又因恨他们，所以领他们出去，要在旷野杀他们。
{Deu 9:29}  For they are your people and your heritage, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.'
{Deu 9:29}  其实他们是你的百姓，你的产业，是你用大能和伸出来的膀臂领出来的。’”
{Deu 10:1}  "At that time the LORD said to me, 'Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to me on the mountain and make an ark of wood.
{Deu 10:1}  “那时，耶和华吩咐我说：‘你要凿出两块石版，和先前的一样，上山到我这里来，又要做一木柜。
{Deu 10:2}  And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.'
{Deu 10:2}  你先前摔碎的那版，其上的字我要写在这版上；你要将这版放在柜中。’
{Deu 10:3}  So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
{Deu 10:3}  于是我用皂荚木做了一柜，又凿出两块石版，和先前的一样，手里拿这两块版上山去了。
{Deu 10:4}  And he wrote on the tablets, in the same writing as before, the Ten Commandments that the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. And the LORD gave them to me.
{Deu 10:4}  耶和华将那大会之日、在山上从火中所传与你们的十条诫，照先前所写的，写在这版上，将版交给我了。
{Deu 10:5}  Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark that I had made. And there they are, as the LORD commanded me."
{Deu 10:5}  我转身下山，将这版放在我所做的柜中，现今还在那里，正如耶和华所吩咐我的。”
{Deu 10:6}  (The people of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried. And his son Eleazar ministered as priest in his place.
{Deu 10:6}  （以色列人从比罗比尼亚干（或作：亚干井）起行，到了摩西拉。亚伦死在那里，就葬在那里。他儿子以利亚撒接续他供祭司的职分。
{Deu 10:7}  From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with brooks of water.
{Deu 10:7}  他们从那里起行，到了谷歌大，又从谷歌大到了有溪水之地的约巴他。
{Deu 10:8}  At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD to stand before the LORD to minister to him and to bless in his name, to this day.
{Deu 10:8}  那时，耶和华将利未支派分别出来，抬耶和华的约柜，又侍立在耶和华面前事奉他，奉他的名祝福，直到今日。
{Deu 10:9}  Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers. The LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God said to him.)
{Deu 10:9}  所以利未人在他弟兄中无分无业，耶和华是他的产业，正如耶和华你神所应许他的。）
{Deu 10:10} "I myself stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights, and the LORD listened to me that time also. The LORD was unwilling to destroy you.
{Deu 10:10} “我又像从前在山上住了四十昼夜。那次耶和华也应允我，不忍将你灭绝。
{Deu 10:11} And the LORD said to me, 'Arise, go on your journey at the head of the people, so that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.'
{Deu 10:11} 耶和华吩咐我说：‘你起来引导这百姓，使他们进去得我向他们列祖起誓应许所赐之地。’”
{Deu 10:12} "And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
{Deu 10:12} “以色列啊，现在耶和华你神向你所要的是什么呢？只要你敬畏耶和华你的神，遵行他的道，爱他，尽心尽性事奉他，
{Deu 10:13} and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD, which I am commanding you today for your good?
{Deu 10:13} 遵守他的诫命律例，就是我今日所吩咐你的，为要叫你得福。
{Deu 10:14} Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it.
{Deu 10:14} 看哪，天和天上的天，地和地上所有的，都属耶和华你的神。
{Deu 10:15} Yet the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day.
{Deu 10:15} 耶和华但喜悦你的列祖，爱他们，从万民中拣选他们的后裔，就是你们，像今日一样。
{Deu 10:16} Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.
{Deu 10:16} 所以你们要将心里的污秽除掉，不可再硬着颈项。
{Deu 10:17} For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe.
{Deu 10:17} 因为耶和华你们的神他是万神之神，万主之主，至大的神，大有能力，大而可畏，不以貌取人，也不受贿赂。
{Deu 10:18} He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing.
{Deu 10:18} 他为孤儿寡妇伸冤，又怜爱寄居的，赐给他衣食。
{Deu 10:19} Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
{Deu 10:19} 所以你们要怜爱寄居的，因为你们在埃及地也作过寄居的。
{Deu 10:20} You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear.
{Deu 10:20} 你要敬畏耶和华你的神，事奉他，专靠他，也要指着他的名起誓。
{Deu 10:21} He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen.
{Deu 10:21} 他是你所赞美的，是你的神，为你做了那大而可畏的事，是你亲眼所看见的。
{Deu 10:22} Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven.
{Deu 10:22} 你的列祖七十人下埃及；现在耶和华你的神使你如同天上的星那样多。”
{Deu 11:1}  "You shall therefore love the LORD your God and keep his charge, his statutes, his rules, and his commandments always.
{Deu 11:1}  “你要爱耶和华你的神，常守他的吩咐、律例、典章、诫命。
{Deu 11:2}  And consider today (since I am not speaking to your children who have not known or seen it), consider the discipline of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched arm,
{Deu 11:2}  你们今日当知道，我本不是和你们的儿女说话；因为他们不知道，也没有看见耶和华你们神的管教、威严、大能的手，和伸出来的膀臂，
{Deu 11:3}  his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land,
{Deu 11:3}  并他在埃及中向埃及王法老和其全地所行的神迹奇事；
{Deu 11:4}  and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and to their chariots, how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD has destroyed them to this day,
{Deu 11:4}  也没有看见他怎样待埃及的军兵、车马，他们追赶你们的时候，耶和华怎样使红海的水淹没他们，将他们灭绝，直到今日，
{Deu 11:5}  and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place,
{Deu 11:5}  并他在旷野怎样待你们，以致你们来到这地方；
{Deu 11:6}  and what he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel.
{Deu 11:6}  也没有看见他怎样待流便子孙以利押的儿子大坍、亚比兰，地怎样在以色列人中间开口，吞了他们和他们的家眷，并帐棚与跟他们的一切活物。
{Deu 11:7}  For your eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD that he did.
{Deu 11:7}  惟有你们亲眼看见耶和华所做的一切大事。”
{Deu 11:8}  "You shall therefore keep the whole commandment that I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and take possession of the land that you are going over to possess,
{Deu 11:8}  “所以，你们要守我今日所吩咐的一切诫命，使你们胆壮，能以进去，得你们所要得的那地，
{Deu 11:9}  and that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey.
{Deu 11:9}  并使你们的日子在耶和华向你们列祖起誓、应许给他们和他们后裔的地上得以长久；那是流奶与蜜之地。
{Deu 11:10} For the land that you are entering to take possession of it is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated it, like a garden of vegetables.
{Deu 11:10} 你要进去得为业的那地，本不像你出来的埃及地。你在那里撒种，用脚浇灌，像浇灌菜园一样。
{Deu 11:11} But the land that you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water by the rain from heaven,
{Deu 11:11} 你们要过去得为业的那地乃是有山有谷、雨水滋润之地，
{Deu 11:12} a land that the LORD your God cares for. The eyes of the LORD your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
{Deu 11:12} 是耶和华你神所眷顾的；从岁首到年终，耶和华你神的眼目时常看顾那地。
{Deu 11:13} "And if you will indeed obey my commandments that I command you today, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
{Deu 11:13} “你们若留意听从我今日所吩咐的诫命，爱耶和华你们的神，尽心尽性事奉他，
{Deu 11:14} he will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the later rain, that you may gather in your grain and your wine and your oil.
{Deu 11:14} 他（原文作我）必按时降秋雨春雨在你们的地上，使你们可以收藏五谷、新酒，和油，
{Deu 11:15} And he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.
{Deu 11:15} 也必使你吃得饱足，并使田野为你的牲畜长草。
{Deu 11:16} Take care lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them;
{Deu 11:16} 你们要谨慎，免得心中受迷惑，就偏离正路，去事奉敬拜别神。
{Deu 11:17} then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and he will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will yield no fruit, and you will perish quickly off the good land that the LORD is giving you.
{Deu 11:17} 耶和华的怒气向你们发作，就使天闭塞不下雨，地也不出产，使你们在耶和华所赐给你们的美地上速速灭亡。
{Deu 11:18} "You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
{Deu 11:18} “你们要将我这话存在心内，留在意中，系在手上为记号，戴在额上为经文；
{Deu 11:19} You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.
{Deu 11:19} 也要教训你们的儿女，无论坐在家里，行在路上，躺下，起来，都要谈论；
{Deu 11:20} You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
{Deu 11:20} 又要写在房屋的门框上，并城门上，
{Deu 11:21} that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth.
{Deu 11:21} 使你们和你们子孙的日子在耶和华向你们列祖起誓、应许给他们的地上得以增多，如天覆地的日子那样多。
{Deu 11:22} For if you will be careful to do all this commandment that I command you to do, loving the LORD your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him,
{Deu 11:22} 你们若留意谨守遵行我所吩咐这一切的诫命，爱耶和华你们的神，行他的道，专靠他，
{Deu 11:23} then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than you.
{Deu 11:23} 他必从你们面前赶出这一切国民，就是比你们更大更强的国民，你们也要得他们的地。
{Deu 11:24} Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours. Your territory shall be from the wilderness to the Lebanon and from the River, the river Euphrates, to the western sea.
{Deu 11:24} 凡你们脚掌所踏之地都必归你们；从旷野和利巴嫩，并伯拉大河，直到西海，都要作你们的境界。
{Deu 11:25} No one shall be able to stand against you. The LORD your God will lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread, as he promised you.
{Deu 11:25} 必无一人能在你们面前站立得住；耶和华你们的神必照他所说的，使惧怕惊恐临到你们所踏之地的居民。
{Deu 11:26} "See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:
{Deu 11:26} “看哪，我今日将祝福与咒诅的话都陈明在你们面前。
{Deu 11:27} the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you today,
{Deu 11:27} 你们若听从耶和华你们神的诫命，就是我今日所吩咐你们的，就必蒙福。
{Deu 11:28} and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way that I am commanding you today, to go after other gods that you have not known.
{Deu 11:28} 你们若不听从耶和华你们神的诫命，偏离我今日所吩咐你们的道，去事奉你们素来所不认识的别神，就必受祸。
{Deu 11:29} And when the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
{Deu 11:29} 及至耶和华你的神领你进入要去得为业的那地，你就要将祝福的话陈明在基利心山上，将咒诅的话陈明在以巴路山上。
{Deu 11:30} Are they not beyond the Jordan, west of the road, toward the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oak of Moreh?
{Deu 11:30} 这二山岂不是在约但河那边，日落之处，在住亚拉巴的迦南人之地与吉甲相对，靠近摩利橡树吗？
{Deu 11:31} For you are to cross over the Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you. And when you possess it and live in it,
{Deu 11:31} 你们要过约但河，进去得耶和华你们神所赐你们为业之地，在那地居住。
{Deu 11:32} you shall be careful to do all the statutes and the rules that I am setting before you today.
{Deu 11:32} 你们要谨守遵行我今日在你们面前所陈明的一切律例典章。”
{Deu 12:1}  "These are the statutes and rules that you shall be careful to do in the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess, all the days that you live on the earth.
{Deu 12:1}  “你们存活于世的日子，在耶和华你们列祖的神所赐你们为业的地上，要谨守遵行的律例典章乃是这些：
{Deu 12:2}  You shall surely destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.
{Deu 12:2}  你们要将所赶出的国民事奉神的各地方，无论是在高山，在小山，在各青翠树下，都毁坏了；
{Deu 12:3}  You shall tear down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and burn their Asherim with fire. You shall chop down the carved images of their gods and destroy their name out of that place.
{Deu 12:3}  也要拆毁他们的祭坛，打碎他们的柱像，用火焚烧他们的木偶，砍下他们雕刻的神像，并将其名从那地方除灭。
{Deu 12:4}  You shall not worship the LORD your God in that way.
{Deu 12:4}  你们不可照他们那样事奉耶和华你们的神。
{Deu 12:5}  But you shall seek the place that the LORD your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name and make his habitation there. There you shall go,
{Deu 12:5}  但耶和华你们的神从你们各支派中选择何处为立他名的居所，你们就当往那里去求问，
{Deu 12:6}  and there you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution that you present, your vow offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock.
{Deu 12:6}  将你们的燔祭、平安祭、十分取一之物，和手中的举祭，并还愿祭、甘心祭，以及牛群羊群中头生的，都奉到那里。
{Deu 12:7}  And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your households, in all that you undertake, in which the LORD your God has blessed you.
{Deu 12:7}  在那里，耶和华你们神的面前，你们和你们的家属都可以吃，并且因你手所办的一切事蒙耶和华你的神赐福，就都欢乐。
{Deu 12:8}  "You shall not do according to all that we are doing here today, everyone doing whatever is right in his own eyes,
{Deu 12:8}  我们今日在这里所行的是各人行自己眼中看为正的事，你们将来不可这样行；
{Deu 12:9}  for you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance that the LORD your God is giving you.
{Deu 12:9}  因为你们还没有到耶和华你神所赐你的安息地，所给你的产业。
{Deu 12:10} But when you go over the Jordan and live in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, and when he gives you rest from all your enemies around, so that you live in safety,
{Deu 12:10} 但你们过了约但河，得以住在耶和华你们神使你们承受为业之地，又使你们太平，不被四围的一切仇敌扰乱，安然居住。
{Deu 12:11} then to the place that the LORD your God will choose, to make his name dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution that you present, and all your finest vow offerings that you vow to the LORD.
{Deu 12:11} 那时要将我所吩咐你们的燔祭、平安祭、十分取一之物，和手中的举祭，并向耶和华许愿献的一切美祭，都奉到耶和华你们神所选择要立为他名的居所。
{Deu 12:12} And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your sons and your daughters, your male servants and your female servants, and the Levite that is within your towns, since he has no portion or inheritance with you.
{Deu 12:12} 你们和儿女、仆婢，并住在你们城里无分无业的利未人，都要在耶和华你们的神面前欢乐。
{Deu 12:13} Take care that you do not offer your burnt offerings at any place that you see,
{Deu 12:13} 你要谨慎，不可在你所看中的各处献燔祭。
{Deu 12:14} but at the place that the LORD will choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I am commanding you.
{Deu 12:14} 惟独耶和华从你那一支派中所选择的地方，你就要在那里献燔祭，行我一切所吩咐你的。
{Deu 12:15} "However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your towns, as much as you desire, according to the blessing of the LORD your God that he has given you. The unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and as of the deer.
{Deu 12:15} “然而，在你各城里都可以照耶和华你神所赐你的福分，随心所欲宰牲吃肉；无论洁净人不洁净人都可以吃，就如吃羚羊与鹿一般。
{Deu 12:16} Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on the earth like water.
{Deu 12:16} 只是不可吃血，要倒在地上，如同倒水一样。
{Deu 12:17} You may not eat within your towns the tithe of your grain or of your wine or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, or any of your vow offerings that you vow, or your freewill offerings or the contribution that you present,
{Deu 12:17} 你的五谷、新酒，和油的十分之一，或是牛群羊群中头生的，或是你许愿献的，甘心献的，或是手中的举祭，都不可在你城里吃。
{Deu 12:18} but you shall eat them before the LORD your God in the place that the LORD your God will choose, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your towns. And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you undertake.
{Deu 12:18} 但要在耶和华你的神面前吃，在耶和华你神所要选择的地方，你和儿女、仆婢，并住在你城里的利未人，都可以吃；也要因你手所办的，在耶和华你神的面前欢乐。
{Deu 12:19} Take care that you do not neglect the Levite as long as you live in your land.
{Deu 12:19} 你要谨慎，在你所住的地方永不可丢弃利未人。
{Deu 12:20} "When the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he has promised you, and you say, 'I will eat meat,' because you crave meat, you may eat meat whenever you desire.
{Deu 12:20} “耶和华你的神照他所应许扩张你境界的时候，你心里想要吃肉，说：‘我要吃肉’，就可以随心所欲地吃肉。
{Deu 12:21} If the place that the LORD your God will choose to put his name there is too far from you, then you may kill any of your herd or your flock, which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and you may eat within your towns whenever you desire.
{Deu 12:21} 耶和华你神所选择要立他名的地方若离你太远，就可以照我所吩咐的，将耶和华赐给你的牛羊取些宰了，可以随心所欲在你城里吃。
{Deu 12:22} Just as the gazelle or the deer is eaten, so you may eat of it. The unclean and the clean alike may eat of it.
{Deu 12:22} 你吃那肉，要像吃羚羊与鹿一般；无论洁净人不洁净人都可以吃。
{Deu 12:23} Only be sure that you do not eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.
{Deu 12:23} 只是你要心意坚定，不可吃血，因为血是生命；不可将血（原文作生命）与肉同吃。
{Deu 12:24} You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth like water.
{Deu 12:24} 不可吃血，要倒在地上，如同倒水一样。
{Deu 12:25} You shall not eat it, that all may go well with you and with your children after you, when you do what is right in the sight of the LORD.
{Deu 12:25} 不可吃血。这样，你行耶和华眼中看为正的事，你和你的子孙就可以得福。
{Deu 12:26} But the holy things that are due from you, and your vow offerings, you shall take, and you shall go to the place that the LORD will choose,
{Deu 12:26} 只是你分别为圣的物和你的还愿祭要奉到耶和华所选择的地方去。
{Deu 12:27} and offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God. The blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, but the flesh you may eat.
{Deu 12:27} 你的燔祭，连肉带血，都要献在耶和华你神的坛上。平安祭的血要倒在耶和华你神的坛上；平安祭的肉，你自己可以吃。
{Deu 12:28} Be careful to obey all these words that I command you, that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, when you do what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.
{Deu 12:28} 你要谨守听从我所吩咐的一切话，行耶和华你神眼中看为善，看为正的事。这样，你和你的子孙就可以永远享福。”
{Deu 12:29} "When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations whom you go in to dispossess, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land,

{Deu 12:30} take care that you be not ensnared to follow them, after they have been destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire about their gods, saying, 'How did these nations serve their gods?--that I also may do the same.'
{Deu 12:30} 那时就要谨慎，不可在他们除灭之后随从他们的恶俗，陷入网罗，也不可访问他们的神说：‘这些国民怎样事奉他们的神，我也要照样行。’
{Deu 12:31} You shall not worship the LORD your God in that way, for every abominable thing that the LORD hates they have done for their gods, for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.
{Deu 12:31} 你不可向耶和华你的神这样行，因为他们向他们的神行了耶和华所憎嫌所恨恶的一切事，甚至将自己的儿女用火焚烧，献与他们的神。
{Deu 12:32} "Everything that I command you, you shall be careful to do. You shall not add to it or take from it.

{Deu 13:2}  and the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, 'Let us go after other gods,' which you have not known, 'and let us serve them,'
{Deu 13:2}  对你说：‘我们去随从你素来所不认识的别神，事奉他吧。’他所显的神迹奇事虽有应验，
{Deu 13:3}  you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. For the LORD your God is testing you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
{Deu 13:3}  你也不可听那先知或是那做梦之人的话；因为这是耶和华你们的神试验你们，要知道你们是尽心尽性爱耶和华你们的神不是。
{Deu 13:4}  You shall walk after the LORD your God and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice, and you shall serve him and hold fast to him.
{Deu 13:4}  你们要顺从耶和华你们的神，敬畏他，谨守他的诫命，听从他的话，事奉他，专靠他。
{Deu 13:5}  But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has taught rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of slavery, to make you leave the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
{Deu 13:5}  那先知或是那做梦的既用言语叛逆那领你们出埃及地、救赎你脱离为奴之家的耶和华你们的神，要勾引你离开耶和华你神所吩咐你行的道，你便要将他治死。这样，就把那恶从你们中间除掉。

{Deu 13:9}  But you shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.
{Deu 13:9}  总要杀他；你先下手，然后众民也下手，将他治死。
{Deu 13:10} You shall stone him to death with stones, because he sought to draw you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
{Deu 13:10} 要用石头打死他，因为他想要勾引你离开那领你出埃及地为奴之家的耶和华你的神。
{Deu 13:11} And all Israel shall hear and fear and never again do any such wickedness as this among you.

{Deu 13:14} then you shall inquire and make search and ask diligently. And behold, if it be true and certain that such an abomination has been done among you,
{Deu 13:14} 你就要探听，查究，细细地访问，果然是真，准有这可憎恶的事行在你们中间，
{Deu 13:15} you shall surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword, devoting it to destruction, all who are in it and its cattle, with the edge of the sword.
{Deu 13:15} 你必要用刀杀那城里的居民，把城里所有的，连牲畜，都用刀杀尽。
{Deu 13:16} You shall gather all its spoil into the midst of its open square and burn the city and all its spoil with fire, as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. It shall be a heap forever. It shall not be built again.
{Deu 13:16} 你从那城里所夺的财物都要堆积在街市上，用火将城和其内所夺的财物都在耶和华你神面前烧尽；那城就永为荒堆，不可再建造。
{Deu 13:17} None of the devoted things shall stick to your hand, that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger and show you mercy and have compassion on you and multiply you, as he swore to your fathers,

{Deu 15:2}  豁免的定例乃是这样：凡债主要把所借给邻舍的豁免了；不可向邻舍和弟兄追讨，因为耶和华的豁免年已经宣告了。
{Deu 15:3}  Of a foreigner you may exact it, but whatever of yours is with your brother your hand shall release.

{Deu 15:15} 要记念你在埃及地作过奴仆，耶和华你的神将你救赎；因此，我今日吩咐你这件事。
{Deu 15:16} But if he says to you, 'I will not go out from you,' because he loves you and your household, since he is well-off with you,
{Deu 15:16} 他若对你说：‘我不愿意离开你’，是因他爱你和你的家，且因在你那里很好，
{Deu 15:17} then you shall take an awl, and put it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your slave forever. And to your female slave you shall do the same.
{Deu 15:17} 你就要拿锥子将他的耳朵在门上刺透，他便永为你的奴仆了。你待婢女也要这样。
{Deu 15:18} It shall not seem hard to you when you let him go free from you, for at half the cost of a hired worker he has served you six years. So the LORD your God will bless you in all that you do.
{Deu 15:18} 你任他自由的时候，不可以为难事，因他服事你六年，较比雇工的工价多加一倍了。耶和华你的神就必在你所做的一切事上赐福与你。”

{Deu 16:3}  You shall eat no leavened bread with it. Seven days you shall eat it with unleavened bread, the bread of affliction--for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste--that all the days of your life you may remember the day when you came out of the land of Egypt.
{Deu 16:3}  你吃这祭牲，不可吃有酵的饼；七日之内要吃无酵饼，就是困苦饼，（你本是急忙出了埃及地）要叫你一生一世记念你从埃及地出来的日子。
{Deu 16:4}  No leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory for seven days, nor shall any of the flesh that you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain all night until morning.

{Deu 16:19} You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality, and you shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the cause of the righteous.
{Deu 16:19} 不可屈枉正直；不可看人的外貌。也不可受贿赂；因为贿赂能叫智慧人的眼变瞎了，又能颠倒义人的话。
{Deu 16:20} Justice, and only justice, you shall follow, that you may live and inherit the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
{Deu 16:20} 你要追求至公至义，好叫你存活，承受耶和华你神所赐你的地。

{Deu 17:2}  "If there is found among you, within any of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, a man or woman who does what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, in transgressing his covenant,
{Deu 17:2}  “在你们中间，在耶和华你神所赐你的诸城中，无论哪座城里，若有人，或男或女，行耶和华你神眼中看为恶的事，违背了他的约，
{Deu 17:3}  and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have forbidden,
{Deu 17:3}  去事奉敬拜别神，或拜日头，或拜月亮，或拜天象，是主不曾吩咐的；
{Deu 17:4}  and it is told you and you hear of it, then you shall inquire diligently, and if it is true and certain that such an abomination has been done in Israel,
{Deu 17:4}  有人告诉你，你也听见了，就要细细地探听，果然是真，准有这可憎恶的事行在以色列中，
{Deu 17:5}  then you shall bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done this evil thing, and you shall stone that man or woman to death with stones.
{Deu 17:5}  你就要将行这恶事的男人或女人拉到城门外，用石头将他打死。
{Deu 17:6}  On the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses the one who is to die shall be put to death; a person shall not be put to death on the evidence of one witness.

{Deu 17:7}  The hand of the witnesses shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
{Deu 17:7}  见证人要先下手，然后众民也下手将他治死。这样，就把那恶从你们中间除掉。
{Deu 17:8}  "If any case arises requiring decision between one kind of homicide and another, one kind of legal right and another, or one kind of assault and another, any case within your towns that is too difficult for you, then you shall arise and go up to the place that the LORD your God will choose.

{Deu 17:9}  去见祭司利未人，并当时的审判官，求问他们，他们必将判语指示你。
{Deu 17:10} Then you shall do according to what they declare to you from that place that the LORD will choose. And you shall be careful to do according to all that they direct you.
{Deu 17:10} 他们在耶和华所选择的地方指示你的判语，你必照着他们所指教你的一切话谨守遵行。
{Deu 17:11} According to the instructions that they give you, and according to the decision which they pronounce to you, you shall do. You shall not turn aside from the verdict that they declare to you, either to the right hand or to the left.
{Deu 17:11} 要按他们所指教你的律法，照他们所断定的去行；他们所指示你的判语，你不可偏离左右。
{Deu 17:12} The man who acts presumptuously by not obeying the priest who stands to minister there before the LORD your God, or the judge, that man shall die. So you shall purge the evil from Israel.
{Deu 17:12} 若有人擅敢不听从那侍立在耶和华你神面前的祭司，或不听从审判官，那人就必治死；这样，便将那恶从以色列中除掉。
{Deu 17:13} And all the people shall hear and fear and not act presumptuously again.
{Deu 17:13} 众百姓都要听见害怕，不再擅敢行事。”
{Deu 17:14} "When you come to the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you possess it and dwell in it and then say, 'I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me,'
{Deu 17:14} “到了耶和华你神所赐你的地，得了那地居住的时候，若说：‘我要立王治理我，像四围的国一样。’
{Deu 17:15} you may indeed set a king over you whom the LORD your God will choose. One from among your brothers you shall set as king over you. You may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother.
{Deu 17:15} 你总要立耶和华你神所拣选的人为王。必从你弟兄中立一人；不可立你弟兄以外的人为王。
{Deu 17:16} Only he must not acquire many horses for himself or cause the people to return to Egypt in order to acquire many horses, since the LORD has said to you, 'You shall never return that way again.'
{Deu 17:16} 只是王不可为自己加添马匹，也不可使百姓回埃及去，为要加添他的马匹，因耶和华曾吩咐你们说：‘不可再回那条路去。’
{Deu 17:17} And he shall not acquire many wives for himself, lest his heart turn away, nor shall he acquire for himself excessive silver and gold.
{Deu 17:17} 他也不可为自己多立妃嫔，恐怕他的心偏邪；也不可为自己多积金银。
{Deu 17:18} "And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself in a book a copy of this law, approved by the Levitical priests.
{Deu 17:18} 他登了国位，就要将祭司利未人面前的这律法书，为自己抄录一本，
{Deu 17:19} And it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the LORD his God by keeping all the words of this law and these statutes, and doing them,
{Deu 17:19} 存在他那里，要平生诵读，好学习敬畏耶和华他的神，谨守遵行这律法书上的一切言语和这些律例，
{Deu 17:20} that his heart may not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, either to the right hand or to the left, so that he may continue long in his kingdom, he and his children, in Israel.
{Deu 17:20} 免得他向弟兄心高气傲，偏左偏右，离了这诫命。这样，他和他的子孙便可在以色列中，在国位上年长日久。”
{Deu 18:1}  "The Levitical priests, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel. They shall eat the LORD's food offerings as their inheritance.
{Deu 18:1}  “祭司利未人和利未全支派必在以色列中无分无业；他们所吃用的就是献给耶和华的火祭和一切所捐的。
{Deu 18:2}  They shall have no inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as he promised them.
{Deu 18:2}  他们在弟兄中必没有产业；耶和华是他们的产业，正如耶和华所应许他们的。
{Deu 18:3}  And this shall be the priests' due from the people, from those offering a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the stomach.
{Deu 18:3}  祭司从百姓所当得的分乃是这样：凡献牛或羊为祭的，要把前腿和两腮并脾胃给祭司。
{Deu 18:4}  The firstfruits of your grain, of your wine and of your oil, and the first fleece of your sheep, you shall give him.
{Deu 18:4}  初收的五谷、新酒和油，并初剪的羊毛，也要给他；
{Deu 18:5}  For the LORD your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for all time.
{Deu 18:5}  因为耶和华你的神从你各支派中将他拣选出来，使他和他子孙永远奉耶和华的名侍立，事奉。
{Deu 18:6}  "And if a Levite comes from any of your towns out of all Israel, where he lives--and he may come when he desires--to the place that the LORD will choose,
{Deu 18:6}  “利未人无论寄居在以色列中的哪一座城，若从那里出来，一心愿意到耶和华所选择的地方，
{Deu 18:7}  and ministers in the name of the LORD his God, like all his fellow Levites who stand to minister there before the LORD,
{Deu 18:7}  就要奉耶和华他神的名事奉，像他众弟兄利未人侍立在耶和华面前事奉一样。
{Deu 18:8}  then he may have equal portions to eat, besides what he receives from the sale of his patrimony.
{Deu 18:8}  除了他卖祖父产业所得的以外，还要得一分祭物与他们同吃。”
{Deu 18:9}  "When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not learn to follow the abominable practices of those nations.
{Deu 18:9}  “你到了耶和华你神所赐之地，那些国民所行可憎恶的事，你不可学着行。
{Deu 18:10} There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens, or a sorcerer
{Deu 18:10} 你们中间不可有人使儿女经火，也不可有占卜的、观兆的、用法术的、行邪术的、
{Deu 18:11} or a charmer or a medium or a necromancer or one who inquires of the dead,
{Deu 18:11} 用迷术的、交鬼的、行巫术的、过阴的。
{Deu 18:12} for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD. And because of these abominations the LORD your God is driving them out before you.
{Deu 18:12} 凡行这些事的都为耶和华所憎恶；因那些国民行这可憎恶的事，所以耶和华你的神将他们从你面前赶出。
{Deu 18:13} You shall be blameless before the LORD your God,
{Deu 18:13} 你要在耶和华你的神面前作完全人。”
{Deu 18:14} for these nations, which you are about to dispossess, listen to fortune-tellers and to diviners. But as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you to do this.
{Deu 18:14} “因你所要赶出的那些国民都听信观兆的和占卜的，至于你，耶和华你的神从来不许你这样行。
{Deu 18:15} "The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers--it is to him you shall listen--
{Deu 18:15} 耶和华你的神要从你们弟兄中间给你兴起一位先知，像我，你们要听从他。
{Deu 18:16} just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, 'Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.'
{Deu 18:16} 正如你在何烈山大会的日子求耶和华你神一切的话，说：‘求你不再叫我听见耶和华我神的声音，也不再叫我看见这大火，免得我死亡。’
{Deu 18:17} And the LORD said to me, 'They are right in what they have spoken.
{Deu 18:17} 耶和华就对我说：‘他们所说的是。
{Deu 18:18} I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.
{Deu 18:18} 我必在他们弟兄中间给他们兴起一位先知，像你。我要将当说的话传给他；他要将我一切所吩咐的都传给他们。
{Deu 18:19} And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him.
{Deu 18:19} 谁不听他奉我名所说的话，我必讨谁的罪。
{Deu 18:20} But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.'
{Deu 18:20} 若有先知擅敢托我的名说我所未曾吩咐他说的话，或是奉别神的名说话，那先知就必治死。’
{Deu 18:21} And if you say in your heart, 'How may we know the word that the LORD has not spoken?'--
{Deu 18:21} 你心里若说：‘耶和华所未曾吩咐的话，我们怎能知道呢？’
{Deu 18:22} when a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the LORD has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You need not be afraid of him.
{Deu 18:22} 先知托耶和华的名说话，所说的若不成就，也无效验，这就是耶和华所未曾吩咐的，是那先知擅自说的，你不要怕他。”
{Deu 19:1}  "When the LORD your God cuts off the nations whose land the LORD your God is giving you, and you dispossess them and dwell in their cities and in their houses,
{Deu 19:1}  “耶和华你神将列国之民剪除的时候，耶和华你神也将他们的地赐给你，你接着住他们的城邑并他们的房屋，
{Deu 19:2}  you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
{Deu 19:2}  就要在耶和华你神所赐你为业的地上分定三座城。
{Deu 19:3}  You shall measure the distances and divide into three parts the area of the land that the LORD your God gives you as a possession, so that any manslayer can flee to them.
{Deu 19:3}  要将耶和华你神使你承受为业的地分为三段；又要预备道路，使误杀人的，都可以逃到那里去。
{Deu 19:4}  "This is the provision for the manslayer, who by fleeing there may save his life. If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally without having hated him in the past--
{Deu 19:4}  “误杀人的逃到那里可以存活，定例乃是这样：凡素无仇恨，无心杀了人的，
{Deu 19:5}  as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies--he may flee to one of these cities and live,
{Deu 19:5}  就如人与邻舍同入树林砍伐树木，手拿斧子一砍，本想砍下树木，不料，斧头脱了把，飞落在邻舍身上，以致于死，这人逃到那些城的一座城，就可以存活，
{Deu 19:6}  lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him fatally, though the man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past.
{Deu 19:6}  免得报血仇的，心中火热追赶他，因路远就追上，将他杀死；其实他不该死，因为他与被杀的素无仇恨。
{Deu 19:7}  Therefore I command you, You shall set apart three cities.
{Deu 19:7}  所以我吩咐你说，要分定三座城。
{Deu 19:8}  And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your fathers--
{Deu 19:8}  耶和华你神若照他向你列祖所起的誓扩张你的境界，将所应许赐你列祖的地全然给你，
{Deu 19:9}  provided you are careful to keep all this commandment, which I command you today, by loving the LORD your God and by walking ever in his ways--then you shall add three other cities to these three,
{Deu 19:9}  你若谨守遵行我今日所吩咐的这一切诫命，爱耶和华你的神，常常遵行他的道，就要在这三座城之外，再添三座城，
{Deu 19:10} lest innocent blood be shed in your land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance, and so the guilt of bloodshed be upon you.
{Deu 19:10} 免得无辜之人的血流在耶和华你神所赐你为业的地上，流血的罪就归于你。
{Deu 19:11} "But if anyone hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and attacks him and strikes him fatally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities,
{Deu 19:11} “若有人恨他的邻舍，埋伏着起来击杀他，以致于死，便逃到这些城的一座城，
{Deu 19:12} then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood, so that he may die.
{Deu 19:12} 本城的长老就要打发人去，从那里带出他来，交在报血仇的手中，将他治死。
{Deu 19:13} Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that it may be well with you.
{Deu 19:13} 你眼不可顾惜他，却要从以色列中除掉流无辜血的罪，使你可以得福。”
{Deu 19:14} "You shall not move your neighbor's landmark, which the men of old have set, in the inheritance that you will hold in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
{Deu 19:14} “在耶和华你神所赐你承受为业之地，不可挪移你邻舍的地界，那是先人所定的。”
{Deu 19:15} "A single witness shall not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong in connection with any offense that he has committed. Only on the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall a charge be established.
{Deu 19:15} “人无论犯什么罪，作什么恶，不可凭一个人的口作见证，总要凭两三个人的口作见证才可定案。
{Deu 19:16} If a malicious witness arises to accuse a person of wrongdoing,
{Deu 19:16} 若有凶恶的见证人起来，见证某人作恶，
{Deu 19:17} then both parties to the dispute shall appear before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who are in office in those days.
{Deu 19:17} 这两个争讼的人就要站在耶和华面前，和当时的祭司，并审判官面前，
{Deu 19:18} The judges shall inquire diligently, and if the witness is a false witness and has accused his brother falsely,
{Deu 19:18} 审判官要细细地查究，若见证人果然是作假见证的，以假见证陷害弟兄，
{Deu 19:19} then you shall do to him as he had meant to do to his brother. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
{Deu 19:19} 你们就要待他如同他想要待的弟兄。这样，就把那恶从你们中间除掉。
{Deu 19:20} And the rest shall hear and fear, and shall never again commit any such evil among you.
{Deu 19:20} 别人听见都要害怕，就不敢在你们中间再行这样的恶了。
{Deu 19:21} Your eye shall not pity. It shall be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
{Deu 19:21} 你眼不可顾惜，要以命偿命，以眼还眼，以牙还牙，以手还手，以脚还脚。”
{Deu 20:1}  "When you go out to war against your enemies, and see horses and chariots and an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid of them, for the LORD your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
{Deu 20:1}  “你出去与仇敌争战的时候，看见马匹、车辆，并有比你多的人民，不要怕他们，因为领你出埃及地的耶和华你神与你同在。
{Deu 20:2}  And when you draw near to the battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to the people
{Deu 20:2}  你们将要上阵的时候，祭司要到百姓面前宣告
{Deu 20:3}  and shall say to them, 'Hear, O Israel, today you are drawing near for battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint. Do not fear or panic or be in dread of them,
{Deu 20:3}  说：‘以色列人哪，你们当听，你们今日将要与仇敌争战，不要胆怯，不要惧怕战兢，也不要因他们惊恐；
{Deu 20:4}  for the LORD your God is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory.'
{Deu 20:4}  因为耶和华你们的神与你们同去，要为你们与仇敌争战，拯救你们。’
{Deu 20:5}  Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying, 'Is there any man who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it.
{Deu 20:5}  官长也要对百姓宣告说：‘谁建造房屋，尚未奉献，他可以回家去，恐怕他阵亡，别人去奉献。
{Deu 20:6}  And is there any man who has planted a vineyard and has not enjoyed its fruit? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man enjoy its fruit.
{Deu 20:6}  谁种葡萄园，尚未用所结的果子，他可以回家去，恐怕他阵亡，别人去用。
{Deu 20:7}  And is there any man who has betrothed a wife and has not taken her? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man take her.'
{Deu 20:7}  谁聘定了妻，尚未迎娶，他可以回家去，恐怕他阵亡，别人去娶。’
{Deu 20:8}  And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, 'Is there any man who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go back to his house, lest he make the heart of his fellows melt like his own.'
{Deu 20:8}  官长又要对百姓宣告说：‘谁惧怕胆怯，他可以回家去，恐怕他弟兄的心消化，和他一样。’
{Deu 20:9}  And when the officers have finished speaking to the people, then commanders shall be appointed at the head of the people.
{Deu 20:9}  官长对百姓宣告完了，就当派军长率领他们。
{Deu 20:10} "When you draw near to a city to fight against it, offer terms of peace to it.
{Deu 20:10} “你临近一座城、要攻打的时候，先要对城里的民宣告和睦的话。
{Deu 20:11} And if it responds to you peaceably and it opens to you, then all the people who are found in it shall do forced labor for you and shall serve you.
{Deu 20:11} 他们若以和睦的话回答你，给你开了城，城里所有的人都要给你效劳，服事你；
{Deu 20:12} But if it makes no peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it.
{Deu 20:12} 若不肯与你和好，反要与你打仗，你就要围困那城。
{Deu 20:13} And when the LORD your God gives it into your hand, you shall put all its males to the sword,

{Deu 29:18} Beware lest there be among you a man or woman or clan or tribe whose heart is turning away today from the LORD our God to go and serve the gods of those nations. Beware lest there be among you a root bearing poisonous and bitter fruit,
{Deu 29:18} 惟恐你们中间，或男或女，或族长或支派长，今日心里偏离耶和华我们的神，去事奉那些国的神；又怕你们中间有恶根生出苦菜和茵陈来，
{Deu 29:19} one who, when he hears the words of this sworn covenant, blesses himself in his heart, saying, 'I shall be safe, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart.' This will lead to the sweeping away of moist and dry alike.
{Deu 29:19} 听见这咒诅的话，心里仍是自夸说：‘我虽然行事心里顽梗，连累众人，却还是平安。’
{Deu 29:20} The LORD will not be willing to forgive him, but rather the anger of the LORD and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and the curses written in this book will settle upon him, and the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven.
{Deu 29:20} 耶和华必不饶恕他；耶和华的怒气与愤恨要向他发作，如烟冒出，将这书上所写的一切咒诅都加在他身上。耶和华又要从天下涂抹他的名，
{Deu 29:21} And the LORD will single him out from all the tribes of Israel for calamity, in accordance with all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.

{Deu 29:23} the whole land burned out with brimstone and salt, nothing sown and nothing growing, where no plant can sprout, an overthrow like that of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger and wrath--
{Deu 29:23} 又看见遍地有硫磺，有盐卤，有火迹，没有耕种，没有出产，连草都不生长，好像耶和华在忿怒中所倾覆的所多玛、蛾摩拉、押玛、洗扁一样，
{Deu 29:24} all the nations will say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land? What caused the heat of this great anger?'
{Deu 29:24} 所看见的人，连万国人，都必问说：‘耶和华为何向此地这样行呢？这样大发烈怒是什么意思呢？’
{Deu 29:25} Then people will say, 'It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt,
{Deu 29:25} 人必回答说：‘是因这地的人离弃了耶和华他们列祖的神，领他们出埃及地的时候与他们所立的约，
{Deu 29:26} and went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them.

{Deu 29:27} Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, bringing upon it all the curses written in this book,
{Deu 29:27} 所以耶和华的怒气向这地发作，将这书上所写的一切咒诅都降在这地上。
{Deu 29:28} and the LORD uprooted them from their land in anger and fury and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as they are this day.'
{Deu 29:28} 耶和华在怒气、忿怒、大恼恨中将他们从本地拔出来，扔在别的地上，像今日一样。’
{Deu 29:29} "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.

{Deu 30:11} “我今日所吩咐你的诫命不是你难行的，也不是离你远的；
{Deu 30:12} It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?'
{Deu 30:12} 不是在天上，使你说：‘谁替我们上天取下来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？’
{Deu 30:13} Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?'
{Deu 30:13} 也不是在海外，使你说：‘谁替我们过海取了来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？’
{Deu 30:14} But the word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you can do it.
{Deu 30:14} 这话却离你甚近，就在你口中，在你心里，使你可以遵行。
{Deu 30:15} "See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil.
{Deu 30:15} “看哪，我今日将生与福，死与祸，陈明在你面前。
{Deu 30:16} If you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you today, by loving the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his rules, then you shall live and multiply, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.
{Deu 30:16} 吩咐你爱耶和华你的神，遵行他的道，谨守他的诫命、律例、典章，使你可以存活，人数增多，耶和华你神就必在你所要进去得为业的地上赐福与你。
{Deu 30:17} But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them,
{Deu 30:17} 倘若你心里偏离，不肯听从，却被勾引去敬拜事奉别神，
{Deu 30:18} I declare to you today, that you shall surely perish. You shall not live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess.
{Deu 30:18} 我今日明明告诉你们，你们必要灭亡；在你过约但河、进去得为业的地上，你的日子必不长久。
{Deu 30:19} I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live,
{Deu 30:19} 我今日呼天唤地向你作见证；我将生死祸福陈明在你面前，所以你要拣选生命，使你和你的后裔都得存活；
{Deu 30:20} loving the LORD your God, obeying his voice and holding fast to him, for he is your life and length of days, that you may dwell in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them."
{Deu 30:20} 且爱耶和华你的神，听从他的话，专靠他；因为他是你的生命，你的日子长久也在乎他。这样，你就可以在耶和华向你列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓应许所赐的地上居住。”
{Deu 31:1}  So Moses continued to speak these words to all Israel.
{Deu 31:1}  摩西去告诉以色列众人
{Deu 31:2}  And he said to them, "I am 120 years old today. I am no longer able to go out and come in. The LORD has said to me, 'You shall not go over this Jordan.'
{Deu 31:2}  说：“我现在一百二十岁了，不能照常出入；耶和华也曾对我说：‘你必不得过这约但河。’
{Deu 31:3}  The LORD your God himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations before you, so that you shall dispossess them, and Joshua will go over at your head, as the LORD has spoken.
{Deu 31:3}  耶和华你们的神必引导你们过去，将这些国民在你们面前灭绝，你们就得他们的地。约书亚必引导你们过去，正如耶和华所说的。
{Deu 31:4}  And the LORD will do to them as he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when he destroyed them.
{Deu 31:4}  耶和华必待他们，如同从前待他所灭绝的亚摩利二王西宏与噩以及他们的国一样。
{Deu 31:5}  And the LORD will give them over to you, and you shall do to them according to the whole commandment that I have commanded you.
{Deu 31:5}  耶和华必将他们交给你们；你们要照我所吩咐的一切命令待他们。
{Deu 31:6}  Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the LORD your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you."
{Deu 31:6}  你们当刚强壮胆，不要害怕，也不要畏惧他们，因为耶和华你的神和你同去。他必不撇下你，也不丢弃你。”
{Deu 31:7}  Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land that the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall put them in possession of it.
{Deu 31:7}  摩西召了约书亚来，在以色列众人眼前对他说：“你当刚强壮胆！因为，你要和这百姓一同进入耶和华向他们列祖起誓应许所赐之地；你也要使他们承受那地为业。
{Deu 31:8}  It is the LORD who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed."
{Deu 31:8}  耶和华必在你前面行；他必与你同在，必不撇下你，也不丢弃你。不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。”
{Deu 31:9}  Then Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
{Deu 31:9}  摩西将这律法写出来，交给抬耶和华约柜的祭司利未子孙和以色列的众长老。
{Deu 31:10} And Moses commanded them, "At the end of every seven years, at the set time in the year of release, at the Feast of Booths,
{Deu 31:10} 摩西吩咐他们说：“每逢七年的末一年，就在豁免年的定期住棚节的时候，
{Deu 31:11} when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
{Deu 31:11} 以色列众人来到耶和华你神所选择的地方朝见他。那时，你要在以色列众人面前将这律法念给他们听。
{Deu 31:12} Assemble the people, men, women, and little ones, and the sojourner within your towns, that they may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, and be careful to do all the words of this law,
{Deu 31:12} 要招聚他们男、女、孩子，并城里寄居的，使他们听，使他们学习，好敬畏耶和华你们的神，谨守、遵行这律法的一切话，
{Deu 31:13} and that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess."
{Deu 31:13} 也使他们未曾晓得这律法的儿女得以听见，学习敬畏耶和华你们的神，在你们过约但河要得为业之地，存活的日子，常常这样行。”
{Deu 31:14} And the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, the days approach when you must die. Call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may commission him." And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
{Deu 31:14} 耶和华对摩西说：“你的死期临近了；要召约书亚来，你们二人站在会幕里，我好嘱咐他。”于是摩西和约书亚去站在会幕里。
{Deu 31:15} And the LORD appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud. And the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance of the tent.
{Deu 31:15} 耶和华在会幕里云柱中显现，云柱停在会幕门以上。
{Deu 31:16} And the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers. Then this people will rise and whore after the foreign gods among them in the land that they are entering, and they will forsake me and break my covenant that I have made with them.
{Deu 31:16} 耶和华又对摩西说：“你必和你列祖同睡。这百姓要起来，在他们所要去的地上，在那地的人中，随从外邦神行邪淫，离弃我，违背我与他们所立的约。
{Deu 31:17} Then my anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide my face from them, and they will be devoured. And many evils and troubles will come upon them, so that they will say in that day, 'Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?'
{Deu 31:17} 那时，我的怒气必向他们发作；我也必离弃他们，掩面不顾他们，以致他们被吞灭，并有许多的祸患灾难临到他们。那日他们必说：‘这些祸患临到我们，岂不是因我们的神不在我们中间吗？’
{Deu 31:18} And I will surely hide my face in that day because of all the evil that they have done, because they have turned to other gods.
{Deu 31:18} 那时，因他们偏向别神所行的一切恶，我必定掩面不顾他们。
{Deu 31:19} "Now therefore write this song and teach it to the people of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the people of Israel.
{Deu 31:19} 现在你要写一篇歌，教导以色列人，传给他们，使这歌见证他们的不是；
{Deu 31:20} For when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to give to their fathers, and they have eaten and are full and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them, and despise me and break my covenant.
{Deu 31:20} 因为我将他们领进我向他们列祖起誓应许那流奶与蜜之地，他们在那里吃得饱足，身体肥胖，就必偏向别神，事奉他们，藐视我，背弃我的约。
{Deu 31:21} And when many evils and troubles have come upon them, this song shall confront them as a witness (for it will live unforgotten in the mouths of their offspring). For I know what they are inclined to do even today, before I have brought them into the land that I swore to give."
{Deu 31:21} 那时，有许多祸患灾难临到他们，这歌必在他们面前作见证，他们后裔的口中必念诵不忘。我未领他们到我所起誓应许之地以先，他们所怀的意念我都知道了。”
{Deu 31:22} So Moses wrote this song the same day and taught it to the people of Israel.
{Deu 31:22} 当日摩西就写了一篇歌，教导以色列人。
{Deu 31:23} And the LORD commissioned Joshua the son of Nun and said, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the people of Israel into the land that I swore to give them. I will be with you."
{Deu 31:23} 耶和华嘱咐嫩的儿子约书亚说：“你当刚强壮胆，因为你必领以色列人进我所起誓应许他们的地；我必与你同在。”
{Deu 31:24} When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book to the very end,
{Deu 31:24} 摩西将这律法的话写在书上，及至写完了，
{Deu 31:25} Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
{Deu 31:25} 就吩咐抬耶和华约柜的利未人说：
{Deu 31:26} "Take this Book of the Law and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.
{Deu 31:26} “将这律法书放在耶和华你们神的约柜旁，可以在那里见证以色列人的不是；
{Deu 31:27} For I know how rebellious and stubborn you are. Behold, even today while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against the LORD. How much more after my death!
{Deu 31:27} 因为我知道你们是悖逆的，是硬着颈项的。我今日还活着与你们同在，你们尚且悖逆耶和华，何况我死后呢？
{Deu 31:28} Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
{Deu 31:28} 你们要将你们支派的众长老和官长都招聚了来，我好将这些话说与他们听，并呼天唤地见证他们的不是。
{Deu 31:29} For I know that after my death you will surely act corruptly and turn aside from the way that I have commanded you. And in the days to come evil will befall you, because you will do what is evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger through the work of your hands."
{Deu 31:29} 我知道我死后，你们必全然败坏，偏离我所吩咐你们的道，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，以手所做的惹他发怒；日后必有祸患临到你们。”
{Deu 31:30} Then Moses spoke the words of this song until they were finished, in the ears of all the assembly of Israel:
{Deu 31:30} 摩西将这一篇歌的话都说与以色列全会众听。
{Deu 32:1}  "Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak, and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
{Deu 32:1}  诸天哪，侧耳，我要说话；愿地也听我口中的言语。
{Deu 32:2}  May my teaching drop as the rain, my speech distill as the dew, like gentle rain upon the tender grass, and like showers upon the herb.
{Deu 32:2}  我的教训要淋漓如雨；我的言语要滴落如露，如细雨降在嫩草上，如甘霖降在菜蔬中。
{Deu 32:3}  For I will proclaim the name of the LORD; ascribe greatness to our God!
{Deu 32:3}  我要宣告耶和华的名；你们要将大德归与我们的神。
{Deu 32:4}  "The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is he.
{Deu 32:4}  他是磐石，他的作为完全；他所行的无不公平，是诚实无伪的神，又公义，又正直。
{Deu 32:5}  They have dealt corruptly with him; they are no longer his children because they are blemished; they are a crooked and twisted generation.
{Deu 32:5}  这乖僻弯曲的世代向他行事邪僻；有这弊病就不是他的儿女。
{Deu 32:6}  Do you thus repay the LORD, you foolish and senseless people? Is not he your father, who created you, who made you and established you?
{Deu 32:6}  愚昧无知的民哪，你们这样报答耶和华吗？他岂不是你的父、将你买来的吗？他是制造你、建立你的。
{Deu 32:7}  Remember the days of old; consider the years of many generations; ask your father, and he will show you, your elders, and they will tell you.
{Deu 32:7}  你当追想上古之日，思念历代之年；问你的父亲，他必指示你；问你的长者，他必告诉你。
{Deu 32:8}  When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he divided mankind, he fixed the borders of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God.
{Deu 32:8}  至高者将地业赐给列邦，将世人分开，就照以色列人的数目立定万民的疆界。
{Deu 32:9}  But the LORD's portion is his people, Jacob his allotted heritage.
{Deu 32:9}  耶和华的分本是他的百姓；他的产业本是雅各。
{Deu 32:10} "He found him in a desert land, and in the howling waste of the wilderness; he encircled him, he cared for him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
{Deu 32:10} 耶和华遇见他在旷野荒凉野兽吼叫之地，就环绕他，看顾他，保护他，如同保护眼中的瞳人。
{Deu 32:11} Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, that flutters over its young, spreading out its wings, catching them, bearing them on its pinions,
{Deu 32:11} 又如鹰搅动巢窝，在雏鹰以上两翅搧展，接取雏鹰，背在两翼之上。
{Deu 32:12} the LORD alone guided him, no foreign god was with him.
{Deu 32:12} 这样，耶和华独自引导他，并无外邦神与他同在。
{Deu 32:13} He made him ride on the high places of the land, and he ate the produce of the field, and he suckled him with honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.
{Deu 32:13} 耶和华使他乘驾地的高处，得吃田间的土产；又使他从磐石中咂蜜，从坚石中吸油；
{Deu 32:14} Curds from the herd, and milk from the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of Bashan and goats, with the very finest of the wheat-- and you drank foaming wine made from the blood of the grape.
{Deu 32:14} 也吃牛的奶油，羊的奶，羊羔的脂油，巴珊所出的公绵羊和山羊，与上好的麦子，也喝葡萄汁酿的酒。
{Deu 32:15} "But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked; you grew fat, stout, and sleek; then he forsook God who made him and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation.
{Deu 32:15} 但耶书仑渐渐肥胖，粗壮，光润，踢跳，奔跑，便离弃造他的神，轻看救他的磐石；
{Deu 32:16} They stirred him to jealousy with strange gods; with abominations they provoked him to anger.
{Deu 32:16} 敬拜别神，触动神的愤恨，行可憎恶的事，惹了他的怒气。
{Deu 32:17} They sacrificed to demons that were no gods, to gods they had never known, to new gods that had come recently, whom your fathers had never dreaded.
{Deu 32:17} 所祭祀的鬼魔并非真神，乃是素不认识的神，是近来新兴的，是你列祖所不畏惧的。
{Deu 32:18} You were unmindful of the Rock that bore you, and you forgot the God who gave you birth.
{Deu 32:18} 你轻忽生你的磐石，忘记产你的神。
{Deu 32:19} "The LORD saw it and spurned them, because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
{Deu 32:19} 耶和华看见他的儿女惹动他，就厌恶他们，
{Deu 32:20} And he said, 'I will hide my face from them; I will see what their end will be, for they are a perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.
{Deu 32:20} 说：我要向他们掩面，看他们的结局如何。他们本是极乖僻的族类，心中无诚实的儿女。
{Deu 32:21} They have made me jealous with what is no god; they have provoked me to anger with their idols. So I will make them jealous with those who are no people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
{Deu 32:21} 他们以那“不算为神”的触动我的愤恨，以虚无的神惹了我的怒气。我也要以那“不成子民”的触动他们的愤恨，以愚昧的国民惹了他们的怒气。
{Deu 32:22} For a fire is kindled by my anger, and it burns to the depths of Sheol, devours the earth and its increase, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.
{Deu 32:22} 因为在我怒中有火烧起，直烧到极深的阴间，把地和地的出产尽都焚烧，山的根基也烧着了。
{Deu 32:23} "'And I will heap disasters upon them; I will spend my arrows on them;
{Deu 32:23} 我要将祸患堆在他们身上，把我的箭向他们射尽。
{Deu 32:24} they shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured by plague and poisonous pestilence; I will send the teeth of beasts against them, with the venom of things that crawl in the dust.
{Deu 32:24} 他们必因饥饿消瘦，被炎热苦毒吞灭。我要打发野兽用牙齿咬他们，并土中腹行的，用毒气害他们。
{Deu 32:25} Outdoors the sword shall bereave, and indoors terror, for young man and woman alike, the nursing child with the man of gray hairs.
{Deu 32:25} 外头有刀剑，内室有惊恐，使人丧亡，使少男、童女、吃奶的、白发的，尽都灭绝。
{Deu 32:26} I would have said, "I will cut them to pieces; I will wipe them from human memory,"
{Deu 32:26} 我说，我必将他们分散远方，使他们的名号从人间除灭。
{Deu 32:27} had I not feared provocation by the enemy, lest their adversaries should misunderstand, lest they should say, "Our hand is triumphant, it was not the LORD who did all this."'
{Deu 32:27} 惟恐仇敌惹动我，只怕敌人错看，说：是我们手的能力，并非耶和华所行的。
{Deu 32:28} "For they are a nation void of counsel, and there is no understanding in them.
{Deu 32:28} 因为以色列民毫无计谋，心中没有聪明。
{Deu 32:29} If they were wise, they would understand this; they would discern their latter end!
{Deu 32:29} 惟愿他们有智慧，能明白这事，肯思念他们的结局。
{Deu 32:30} How could one have chased a thousand, and two have put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had given them up?
{Deu 32:30} 若不是他们的磐石卖了他们，若不是耶和华交出他们，一人焉能追赶他们千人？二人焉能使万人逃跑呢？
{Deu 32:31} For their rock is not as our Rock; our enemies are by themselves.
{Deu 32:31} 据我们的仇敌自己断定，他们的磐石不如我们的磐石。
{Deu 32:32} For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of poison; their clusters are bitter;
{Deu 32:32} 他们的葡萄树是所多玛的葡萄树，蛾摩拉田园所生的；他们的葡萄是毒葡萄，全挂都是苦的。
{Deu 32:33} their wine is the poison of serpents and the cruel venom of asps.
{Deu 32:33} 他们的酒是大蛇的毒气，是虺蛇残害的恶毒。
{Deu 32:34} "'Is not this laid up in store with me, sealed up in my treasuries?
{Deu 32:34} 这不都是积蓄在我这里，封锁在我府库中吗？
{Deu 32:35} Vengeance is mine, and recompense, for the time when their foot shall slip; for the day of their calamity is at hand, and their doom comes swiftly.'
{Deu 32:35} 他们失脚的时候，伸冤报应在我；因他们遭灾的日子近了；那要临在他们身上的必速速来到。
{Deu 32:36} For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone and there is none remaining, bond or free.
{Deu 32:36} 耶和华见他百姓毫无能力，无论困住的、自由的都没有剩下，就必为他们伸冤，为他的仆人后悔。
{Deu 32:37} Then he will say, 'Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge,
{Deu 32:37} 他必说：他们的神，他们所投靠的磐石，
{Deu 32:38} who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you; let them be your protection!
{Deu 32:38} 就是向来吃他们祭牲的脂油，喝他们奠祭之酒的，在那里呢？他可以兴起帮助你们，护卫你们。
{Deu 32:39} "'See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god beside me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
{Deu 32:39} 你们如今要知道：我，惟有我是神；在我以外并无别神。我使人死，我使人活；我损伤，我也医治，并无人能从我手中救出来。
{Deu 32:40} For I lift up my hand to heaven and swear, As I live forever,
{Deu 32:40} 我向天举手说：我凭我的永生起誓：
{Deu 32:41} if I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand takes hold on judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and will repay those who hate me.
{Deu 32:41} 我若磨我闪亮的刀，手掌审判之权，就必报复我的敌人，报应恨我的人。
{Deu 32:42} I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh-- with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the long-haired heads of the enemy.'
{Deu 32:42} 我要使我的箭饮血饮醉，就是被杀被掳之人的血。我的刀要吃肉，乃是仇敌中首领之头的肉。
{Deu 32:43} "Rejoice with him, O heavens; bow down to him, all gods, for he avenges the blood of his children and takes vengeance on his adversaries. He repays those who hate him and cleanses his people's land."
{Deu 32:43} 你们外邦人当与主的百姓一同欢呼；因他要伸他仆人流血的冤，报应他的敌人，洁净他的地，救赎他的百姓。
{Deu 32:44} Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.
{Deu 32:44} 摩西和嫩的儿子约书亚去将这歌的一切话说给百姓听。
{Deu 32:45} And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
{Deu 32:45} 摩西向以色列众人说完了这一切的话，
{Deu 32:46} he said to them, "Take to heart all the words by which I am warning you today, that you may command them to your children, that they may be careful to do all the words of this law.
{Deu 32:46} 又说：“我今日所警教你们的，你们都要放在心上；要吩咐你们的子孙谨守遵行这律法上的话。
{Deu 32:47} For it is no empty word for you, but your very life, and by this word you shall live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess."
{Deu 32:47} 因为这不是虚空、与你们无关的事，乃是你们的生命；在你们过约但河要得为业的地上必因这事日子得以长久。”
{Deu 32:48} That very day the LORD spoke to Moses,
{Deu 32:48} 当日，耶和华吩咐摩西说：
{Deu 32:49} "Go up this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, opposite Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel for a possession.
{Deu 32:49} “你上这亚巴琳山中的尼波山去，在摩押地与耶利哥相对，观看我所要赐给以色列人为业的迦南地。
{Deu 32:50} And die on the mountain which you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died in Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,
{Deu 32:50} 你必死在你所登的山上，归你列祖（原文作本民）去，像你哥哥亚伦死在何珥山上，归他的列祖一样。
{Deu 32:51} because you broke faith with me in the midst of the people of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, and because you did not treat me as holy in the midst of the people of Israel.
{Deu 32:51} 因为你们在寻的旷野，加低斯的米利巴水，在以色列人中没有尊我为圣，得罪了我。
{Deu 32:52} For you shall see the land before you, but you shall not go there, into the land that I am giving to the people of Israel."
{Deu 32:52} 我所赐给以色列人的地，你可以远远的观看，却不得进去。”
{Deu 33:1}  This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the people of Israel before his death.
{Deu 33:1}  以下是神人摩西在未死之先为以色列人所祝的福：
{Deu 33:2}  He said, "The LORD came from Sinai and dawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran; he came from the ten thousands of holy ones, with flaming fire at his right hand.
{Deu 33:2}  他说：耶和华从西乃而来，从西珥向他们显现，从巴兰山发出光辉，从万万圣者中来临，从他右手为百姓传出烈火的律法。
