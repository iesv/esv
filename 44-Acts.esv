{Act 1:1}   In the first book, O Theophilus, [提阿非罗] I have dealt /delt/[VED:deal Phr.V 与...交涉] with all that Jesus began to do and teach,
{Act 1:1}   提阿非罗啊，我已经作了前书，论到耶稣开头一切所行所教训的，
{Act 1:2}   until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
{Act 1:2}   直到他藉着圣灵吩咐所拣选的使徒，以后被接上升的日子为止。
{Act 1:3}   He presented /prezent/[呈现] himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
{Act 1:3}   他受害之后，用许多的凭据将自己活活的显给使徒看，四十天之久向他们显现，讲说神国的事。
{Act 1:4}   And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, "you heard from me;
{Act 1:4}   耶稣和他们聚集的时候，嘱咐他们说：“不要离开耶路撒冷，要等候父所应许的，就是你们听见我说过的。
{Act 1:5}   for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
{Act 1:5}   约翰是用水施洗，但不多几日，你们要受圣灵的洗。”
{Act 1:6}   So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"
{Act 1:6}   他们聚集的时候，问耶稣说：“主啊，你复兴以色列国就在这时候吗？”
{Act 1:7}   He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.
{Act 1:7}   耶稣对他们说：“父凭着自己的权柄所定的时候、日期，不是你们可以知道的。
{Act 1:8}   But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, /sa'mxria/ and to the end of the earth."
{Act 1:8}   但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力，并要在耶路撒冷、犹太全地，和撒玛利亚，直到地极，作我的见证。”
{Act 1:9}   And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
{Act 1:9}   说了这话，他们正看的时候，他就被取上升，有一朵云彩把他接去，便看不见他了。
{Act 1:10}  And while they were gazing /gAz/[注视] into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,
{Act 1:10}  当他往上去，他们定睛望天的时候，忽然有两个人身穿白衣，站在旁边，说：
{Act 1:11}  and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."
{Act 1:11}  “加利利人哪，你们为什么站着望天呢？这离开你们被接升天的耶稣，你们见他怎样往天上去，他还要怎样来。”
{Act 1:12}  Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
{Act 1:12}  有一座山，名叫橄榄山，离耶路撒冷不远，约有安息日可走的路程。当下，门徒从那里回耶路撒冷去，
{Act 1:13}  And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.
{Act 1:13}  进了城，就上了所住的一间楼房；在那里有彼得、约翰、雅各、安得烈、腓力、多马、巴多罗买、马太、亚勒腓的儿子雅各、奋锐党的西门，和雅各的儿子（或作：兄弟）犹大。
{Act 1:14}  All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
{Act 1:14}  这些人同着几个妇人和耶稣的母亲马利亚，并耶稣的弟兄，都同心合意的恒切祷告。
{Act 1:15}  In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said,
{Act 1:15}  那时，有许多人聚会，约有一百二十名，彼得就在弟兄中间站起来，说：
{Act 1:16}  "Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
{Act 1:16}  “弟兄们！圣灵藉大卫的口，在圣经上预言领人捉拿耶稣的犹大，这话是必须应验的。
{Act 1:17}  For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry."
{Act 1:17}  他本来列在我们数中，并且在使徒的职任上得了一分。
{Act 1:18}  (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.
{Act 1:18}  这人用他作恶的工价买了一块田，以后身子仆倒，肚腹崩裂，肠子都流出来。
{Act 1:19}  And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
{Act 1:19}  住在耶路撒冷的众人都知道这事，所以按着他们那里的话给那块田起名叫亚革大马，就是“血田”的意思。
{Act 1:20}  "For it is written in the Book of Psalms, "'May his camp become desolate, and let there be no one to dwell in it'; and "'Let another take his office.'
{Act 1:20}  因为诗篇上写着，说：愿他的住处变为荒场，无人在内居住；又说：愿别人得他的职分。
{Act 1:21}  So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
{Act 1:21}  所以，主耶稣在我们中间始终出入的时候，
{Act 1:22}  beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us--one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection."
{Act 1:22}  就是从约翰施洗起，直到主离开我们被接上升的日子为止，必须从那常与我们作伴的人中立一位与我们同作耶稣复活的见证。”
{Act 1:23}  And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias.
{Act 1:23}  于是选举两个人，就是那叫做巴撒巴，又称呼犹士都的约瑟，和马提亚。
{Act 1:24}  And they prayed and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen
{Act 1:24}  众人就祷告说：“主阿，你知道万人的心，求你从这两个人中，指明你所拣选的是谁，叫他得这使徒的位分。这位分犹大已经丢弃，往自己的地方去了。”
{Act 1:25}  to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place."
{Act 1:25}  (SEE 1:24)
{Act 1:26}  And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
{Act 1:26}  于是众人为他们摇签，摇出马提亚来；他就和十一个使徒同列。
{Act 2:1}   When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place.
{Act 2:1}   五旬节到了，门徒都聚集在一处。
{Act 2:2}   And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.
{Act 2:2}   忽然，从天上有响声下来，好像一阵大风吹过，充满了他们所坐的屋子，
{Act 2:3}   And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.
{Act 2:3}   又有舌头如火焰显现出来，分开落在他们各人头上。
{Act 2:4}   And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.
{Act 2:4}   他们就都被圣灵充满，按着圣灵所赐的口才说起别国的话来。
{Act 2:5}   Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.
{Act 2:5}   那时，有虔诚的犹太人从天下各国来，住在耶路撒冷。
{Act 2:6}   And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language.
{Act 2:6}   这声音一响，众人都来聚集，各人听见门徒用众人的乡谈说话，就甚纳闷；
{Act 2:7}   And they were amazed and astonished, saying, "Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
{Act 2:7}   都惊讶希奇说：“看哪，这说话的不都是加利利人吗？
{Act 2:8}   And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language?
{Act 2:8}   我们各人，怎么听见他们说我们生来所用的乡谈呢？
{Act 2:9}   Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
{Act 2:9}   我们帕提亚人、玛代人、以拦人，和住在米所波大米、犹太、加帕多家、本都、亚西亚、
{Act 2:10}  Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,
{Act 2:10}  弗吕家、旁非利亚、埃及的人，并靠近古利奈的吕彼亚一带地方的人，从罗马来的客旅中，或是犹太人，或是进犹太教的人，
{Act 2:11}  both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians--we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God."
{Act 2:11}  革哩底和亚拉伯人，都听见他们用我们的乡谈，讲说神的大作为。”
{Act 2:12}  And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
{Act 2:12}  众人就都惊讶猜疑，彼此说：“这是什么意思呢？”
{Act 2:13}  But others mocking said, "They are filled with new wine."
{Act 2:13}  还有人讥诮说：他们无非是新酒灌满了。
{Act 2:14}  But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.
{Act 2:14}  彼得和十一个使徒站起，高声说：“犹太人和一切住在耶路撒冷的人哪，这件事你们当知道，也当侧耳听我的话。
{Act 2:15}  For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.
{Act 2:15}  你们想这些人是醉了；其实不是醉了，因为时候刚到巳初。
{Act 2:16}  But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:
{Act 2:16}  这正是先知约珥所说的：
{Act 2:17}  "'And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;
{Act 2:17}  神说：在末后的日子，我要将我的灵浇灌凡有血气的。你们的儿女要说预言；你们的少年人要见异象；老年人要做异梦。
{Act 2:18}  even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.
{Act 2:18}  在那些日子，我要将我的灵浇灌我的仆人和使女，他们就要说预言。
{Act 2:19}  And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;
{Act 2:19}  在天上、我要显出奇事；在地下、我要显出神迹；有血，有火，有烟雾。
{Act 2:20}  the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.
{Act 2:20}  日头要变为黑暗，月亮要变为血；这都在主大而明显的日子未到以前。
{Act 2:21}  And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'
{Act 2:21}  到那时候，凡求告主名的，就必得救。
{Act 2:22}  "Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know--
{Act 2:22}  “以色列人哪，请听我的话：神藉着拿撒勒人耶稣在你们中间施行异能、奇事神迹，将他证明出来，这是你们自己知道的。
{Act 2:23}  this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.
{Act 2:23}  他既按着神的定旨先见被交与人，你们就藉着无法之人的手，把他钉在十字架上，杀了。
{Act 2:24}  God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.
{Act 2:24}  神却将死的痛苦解释了，叫他复活，因为他原不能被死拘禁。
{Act 2:25}  For David says concerning him, "'I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;
{Act 2:25}  大卫指着他说：我看见主常在我眼前；他在我右边，叫我不至于摇动。
{Act 2:26}  therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope.
{Act 2:26}  所以，我心里欢喜，我的灵（原文作舌）快乐；并且我的肉身要安居在指望中。
{Act 2:27}  For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption.
{Act 2:27}  因你必不将我的灵魂撇在阴间，也不叫你的圣者见朽坏。
{Act 2:28}  You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.'
{Act 2:28}  你已将生命的道路指示我，必叫我因见你的面（或作：叫我在你面前）得着满足的快乐。
{Act 2:29}  "Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
{Act 2:29}  “弟兄们！先祖大卫的事，我可以明明的对你们说：他死了，也葬埋了，并且他的坟墓直到今日还在我们这里。
{Act 2:30}  Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,
{Act 2:30}  大卫既是先知，又晓得神曾向他起誓，要从他的后裔中立一位坐在他的宝座上，
{Act 2:31}  he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
{Act 2:31}  就预先看明这事，讲论基督复活说：他的灵魂不撇在阴间；他的肉身也不见朽坏。
{Act 2:32}  This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.
{Act 2:32}  这耶稣，神已经叫他复活了，我们都为这事作见证。
{Act 2:33}  Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.
{Act 2:33}  他既被神的右手高举（或作：他既高举在神的右边），又从父受了所应许的圣灵，就把你们所看见所听见的，浇灌下来。
{Act 2:34}  For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, "'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
{Act 2:34}  大卫并没有升到天上，但自己说：主对我主说：你坐在我的右边，
{Act 2:35}  until I make your enemies your footstool."'
{Act 2:35}  等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。
{Act 2:36}  Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."
{Act 2:36}  “故此，以色列全家当确实的知道，你们钉在十字架上的这位耶稣，神已经立他为主，为基督了。”
{Act 2:37}  Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
{Act 2:37}  众人听见这话，觉得扎心，就对彼得和其余的使徒说：“弟兄们，我们当怎样行？”
{Act 2:38}  And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
{Act 2:38}  彼得说：“你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，就必领受所赐的圣灵；
{Act 2:39}  For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself."
{Act 2:39}  因为这应许是给你们和你们的儿女，并一切在远方的人，就是主我们神所召来的。”
{Act 2:40}  And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation."
{Act 2:40}  彼得还用许多话作见证，劝勉他们说：“你们当救自己脱离这弯曲的世代。”
{Act 2:41}  So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.
{Act 2:41}  于是领受他话的人就受了洗。那一天，门徒约添了三千人，
{Act 2:42}  And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.
{Act 2:42}  都恒心遵守使徒的教训，彼此交接，擘饼，祈祷。
{Act 2:43}  And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles.
{Act 2:43}  众人都惧怕；使徒又行了许多奇事神迹。
{Act 2:44}  And all who believed were together and had all things in common.
{Act 2:44}  信的人都在一处，凡物公用；
{Act 2:45}  And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.
{Act 2:45}  并且卖了田产，家业，照各人所需用的分给各人。
{Act 2:46}  And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,
{Act 2:46}  他们天天同心合意恒切的在殿里，且在家中擘饼，存着欢喜、诚实的心用饭，
{Act 2:47}  praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.
{Act 2:47}  赞美神，得众民的喜爱。主将得救的人天天加给他们。
{Act 3:1}   Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
{Act 3:1}   申初祷告的时候，彼得、约翰上圣殿去。
{Act 3:2}   And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple.
{Act 3:2}   有一个人，生来是瘸腿的，天天被人抬来，放在殿的一个门口（那门名叫美门），要求进殿的人周济。
{Act 3:3}   Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms.
{Act 3:3}   他看见彼得、约翰将要进殿，就求他们周济。
{Act 3:4}   And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, "Look at us."
{Act 3:4}   彼得约翰定睛看他；彼得说：“你看我们！”
{Act 3:5}   And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.
{Act 3:5}   那人就留意看他们，指望得着什么。
{Act 3:6}   But Peter said, "I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!"
{Act 3:6}   彼得说：“金银我都没有，只把我所有的给你：我奉拿撒勒人耶稣基督的名，叫你起来行走！”
{Act 3:7}   And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.
{Act 3:7}   于是拉着他的右手，扶他起来；他的脚和踝子骨立刻健壮了，
{Act 3:8}   And leaping up he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.
{Act 3:8}   就跳起来，站着，又行走，同他们进了殿，走着，跳着，赞美神。
{Act 3:9}   And all the people saw him walking and praising God,
{Act 3:9}   百姓都看见他行走，赞美神；
{Act 3:10}  and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
{Act 3:10}  认得他是那素常坐在殿的美门口求周济的，就因他所遇着的事满心希奇、惊讶。
{Act 3:11}  While he clung to Peter and John, all the people, utterly astounded, ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's.
{Act 3:11}  那人正在称为所罗门的廊下，拉着彼得、约翰；众百姓一齐跑到他们那里，很觉希奇。
{Act 3:12}  And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: "Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk?
{Act 3:12}  彼得看见，就对百姓说：“以色列人哪，为什么把这事当作希奇呢？为什么定睛看我们，以为我们凭自己的能力和虔诚使这人行走呢？
{Act 3:13}  The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.
{Act 3:13}  亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的神，就是我们列祖的神，已经荣耀了他的仆人（或作：儿子）耶稣；你们却把他交付彼拉多。彼拉多定意要释放他，你们竟在彼拉多面前弃绝了他。
{Act 3:14}  But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
{Act 3:14}  你们弃绝了那圣洁公义者，反求着释放一个凶手给你们。
{Act 3:15}  and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.
{Act 3:15}  你们杀了那生命的主，神却叫他从死里复活了；我们都是为这事作见证。
{Act 3:16}  And his name--by faith in his name--has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.
{Act 3:16}  我们因信他的名，他的名便叫你们所看见所认识的这人健壮了；正是他所赐的信心，叫这人在你们众人面前全然好了。
{Act 3:17}  "And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
{Act 3:17}  弟兄们，我晓得你们作这事是出于不知，你们的官长也是如此。
{Act 3:18}  But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled.
{Act 3:18}  但神曾藉众先知的口，预言基督将要受害，就这样应验了。
{Act 3:19}  Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out,
{Act 3:19}  所以，你们当悔改归正，使你们的罪得以涂抹，这样，那安舒的日子就必从主面前来到；
{Act 3:20}  that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus,
{Act 3:20}  主也必差遣所预定给你们的基督（耶稣）降临。
{Act 3:21}  whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago.
{Act 3:21}  天必留他，等到万物复兴的时候，就是神从创世以来、藉着圣先知的口所说的。
{Act 3:22}  Moses said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you.
{Act 3:22}  摩西曾说：‘主神要从你们弟兄中间给你们兴起一位先知像我，凡他向你们所说的，你们都要听从。
{Act 3:23}  And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.'
{Act 3:23}  凡不听从那先知的，必要从民中全然灭绝。’
{Act 3:24}  And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days.
{Act 3:24}  从撒母耳以来的众先知，凡说预言的，也都说到这些日子。
{Act 3:25}  You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, 'And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'
{Act 3:25}  你们是先知的子孙，也承受神与你们祖宗所立的约，就是对亚伯拉罕说：‘地上万族都要因你的后裔得福。’
{Act 3:26}  God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness."
{Act 3:26}  神既兴起他的仆人，（或作：儿子），就先差他到你们这里来，赐福给你们，叫你们各人回转，离开罪恶。”
{Act 4:1}   And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,
{Act 4:1}   使徒对百姓说话的时候，祭司们和守殿官，并撒都该人忽然来了。
{Act 4:2}   greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
{Act 4:2}   因他们教训百姓，本着耶稣，传说死人复活，就很烦恼，
{Act 4:3}   And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.
{Act 4:3}   于是下手拿住他们；因为天已经晚了，就把他们押到第二天。
{Act 4:4}   But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.
{Act 4:4}   但听道之人有许多信的，男丁数目约有五千。
{Act 4:5}   On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem,
{Act 4:5}   第二天，官府、长老，和文士在耶路撒冷聚会，
{Act 4:6}   with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family.
{Act 4:6}   又有大祭司亚那和该亚法、约翰、亚力山大，并大祭司的亲族都在那里，
{Act 4:7}   And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, "By what power or by what name did you do this?"
{Act 4:7}   叫使徒站在当中，就问他们说：“你们用什么能力，奉谁的名做这事呢？”
{Act 4:8}   Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders,
{Act 4:8}   那时彼得被圣灵充满，对他们说：
{Act 4:9}   if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,
{Act 4:9}   “治民的官府和长老啊，倘若今日因为在残疾人身上所行的善事查问我们他是怎么得了痊愈，
{Act 4:10}  let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead--by him this man is standing before you well.
{Act 4:10}  你们众人和以色列百姓都当知道，站在你们面前的这人得痊愈是因你们所钉十字架、神叫他从死里复活的拿撒勒人耶稣基督的名。
{Act 4:11}  This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.
{Act 4:11}  他是你们匠人所弃的石头，已成了房角的头块石头。
{Act 4:12}  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."
{Act 4:12}  除他以外，别无拯救；因为在天下人间，没有赐下别的名，我们可以靠着得救。”
{Act 4:13}  Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus.
{Act 4:13}  他们见彼得、约翰的胆量，又看出他们原是没有学问的小民，就希奇，认明他们是跟过耶稣的；
{Act 4:14}  But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.
{Act 4:14}  又看见那治好了的人和他们一同站着，就无话可驳。
{Act 4:15}  But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another,
{Act 4:15}  于是吩咐他们从公会出去，就彼此商议说：
{Act 4:16}  saying, "What shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
{Act 4:16}  “我们当怎样办这两个人呢？因为他们诚然行了一件明显的神迹，凡住耶路撒冷的人都知道，我们也不能说没有。
{Act 4:17}  But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name."
{Act 4:17}  惟恐这事越发传扬在民间，我们必须恐吓他们，叫他们不再奉这名对人讲论。”
{Act 4:18}  So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
{Act 4:18}  于是叫了他们来，禁止他们总不可奉耶稣的名讲论教训人。
{Act 4:19}  But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge,
{Act 4:19}  彼得、约翰说：“听从你们，不听从神，这在神面前合理不合理，你们自己酌量吧！
{Act 4:20}  for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard."
{Act 4:20}  我们所看见所听见的，不能不说。”
{Act 4:21}  And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened.
{Act 4:21}  官长为百姓的缘故，想不出法子刑罚他们，又恐吓一番，把他们释放了。这是因众人为所行的奇事都归荣耀与神。
{Act 4:22}  For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
{Act 4:22}  原来藉着神迹医好的那人有四十多岁了。
{Act 4:23}  When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
{Act 4:23}  二人既被释放，就到会友那里去，把祭司长和长老所说的话都告诉他们。
{Act 4:24}  And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, "Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,
{Act 4:24}  他们听见了，就同心合意的高声向神说：“主啊！你是造天、地、海，和其中万物的，
{Act 4:25}  who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit, "'Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples plot in vain?
{Act 4:25}  你曾藉着圣灵，托你仆人我们祖宗大卫的口，说：外邦为什么争闹？万民为什么谋算虚妄的事？
{Act 4:26}  The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed'--
{Act 4:26}  世上的君王一齐起来，臣宰也聚集，要敌挡主，并主的受膏者（或作：基督）。
{Act 4:27}  for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
{Act 4:27}  希律和本丢彼拉多，外邦人和以色列民，果然在这城里聚集，要攻打你所膏的圣仆（仆：或作子）耶稣，
{Act 4:28}  to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.
{Act 4:28}  成就你手和你意旨所预定必有的事。
{Act 4:29}  And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness,
{Act 4:29}  他们恐吓我们，现在求主鉴察，一面叫你仆人大放胆量讲你的道，一面伸出你的手来医治疾病，并且使神迹奇事因着你圣仆（仆：或作子）耶稣的名行出来。”
{Act 4:30}  while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
{Act 4:30}  (SEE 4:29)
{Act 4:31}  And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.
{Act 4:31}  祷告完了，聚会的地方震动，他们就都被圣灵充满，放胆讲论神的道。
{Act 4:32}  Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common.
{Act 4:32}  那许多信的人都是一心一意的，没有一人说他的东西有一样是自己的，都是大家公用。
{Act 4:33}  And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
{Act 4:33}  使徒大有能力，见证主耶稣复活；众人也都蒙大恩。
{Act 4:34}  There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold
{Act 4:34}  内中也没有一个缺乏的，因为人人将田产房屋都卖了，把所卖的价银拿来，放在使徒脚前，
{Act 4:35}  and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.
{Act 4:35}  照各人所需用的，分给各人。
{Act 4:36}  Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,
{Act 4:36}  有一个利未人，生在居比路，名叫约瑟，使徒称他为巴拿巴（巴拿巴翻出来就是劝慰子）。
{Act 4:37}  sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
{Act 4:37}  他有田地，也卖了，把价银拿来，放在使徒脚前。
{Act 5:1}   But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,
{Act 5:1}   有一个人，名叫亚拿尼亚，同他的妻子撒非喇卖了田产，
{Act 5:2}   and with his wife's knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles' feet.
{Act 5:2}   把价银私自留下几分，他的妻子也知道，其余的几分拿来放在使徒脚前。
{Act 5:3}   But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?
{Act 5:3}   彼得说：“亚拿尼亚！为什么撒但充满了你的心，叫你欺哄圣灵，把田地的价银私自留下几分呢？
{Act 5:4}   While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God."
{Act 5:4}   田地还没有卖，不是你自己的吗？既卖了，价银不是你作主吗？你怎么心里起这意念呢？你不是欺哄人，是欺哄神了。”
{Act 5:5}   When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard of it.
{Act 5:5}   亚拿尼亚听见这话，就仆倒，断了气；听见的人都甚惧怕。
{Act 5:6}   The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him.
{Act 5:6}   有些少年人起来，把他包裹，抬出去埋葬了。
{Act 5:7}   After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
{Act 5:7}   约过了三小时，他的妻子进来，还不知道这事。
{Act 5:8}   And Peter said to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much." And she said, "Yes, for so much."
{Act 5:8}   彼得对他说：“你告诉我，你们卖田地的价银就是这些吗？”他说：“就是这些。”
{Act 5:9}   But Peter said to her, "How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."
{Act 5:9}   彼得说：“你们为什么同心试探主的灵呢？埋葬你丈夫之人的脚已到门口，他们也要把你抬出去。”
{Act 5:10}  Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
{Act 5:10}  妇人立刻仆倒在彼得脚前，断了气。那些少年人进来，见他已经死了，就抬出去，埋在他丈夫旁边。
{Act 5:11}  And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.
{Act 5:11}  全教会和听见这事的人都甚惧怕。
{Act 5:12}  Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico.
{Act 5:12}  主藉使徒的手在民间行了许多神迹奇事；他们（或作：信的人）都同心合意的在所罗门的廊下。
{Act 5:13}  None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high esteem.
{Act 5:13}  其余的人没有一个敢贴近他们百姓却尊重他们。
{Act 5:14}  And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,
{Act 5:14}  信而归主的人越发增添，连男带女很多。
{Act 5:15}  so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them.
{Act 5:15}  甚至有人将病人抬到街上，放在床上或褥子上，指望彼得过来的时候，或者得他的影儿照在什么人身上。
{Act 5:16}  The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
{Act 5:16}  还有许多人带着病人和被污鬼缠磨的，从耶路撒冷四围的城邑来，全都得了医治。
{Act 5:17}  But the high priest rose up, and all who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and filled with jealousy
{Act 5:17}  大祭司和他的一切同人，就是撒都该教门的人，都起来，满心忌恨，
{Act 5:18}  they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison.
{Act 5:18}  就下手拿住使徒，收在外监。
{Act 5:19}  But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,
{Act 5:19}  但主的使者夜间开了监门，领他们出来，
{Act 5:20}  "Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life."
{Act 5:20}  说：“你们去站在殿里，把这生命的道都讲给百姓听。”
{Act 5:21}  And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest came, and those who were with him, they called together the council, all the senate of the people of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
{Act 5:21}  使徒听了这话，天将亮的时候就进殿里去教训人。大祭司和他的同人来了，叫齐公会的人，和以色列族的众长老，就差人到监里去，要把使徒提出来。
{Act 5:22}  But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported,
{Act 5:22}  但差役到了，不见他们在监里，就回来禀报说：
{Act 5:23}  "We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them we found no one inside."
{Act 5:23}  “我们看见监牢关得极妥当，看守的人也站在门外；及至开了门，里面一个人都不见。”
{Act 5:24}  Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to.
{Act 5:24}  守殿官和祭司长听见这话，心里犯难，不知这事将来如何。
{Act 5:25}  And someone came and told them, "Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people."
{Act 5:25}  有一个人来禀报说：“你们收在监里的人，现在站在殿里教训百姓。”
{Act 5:26}  Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but not by force, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.
{Act 5:26}  于是守殿官和差役去带使徒来，并没有用强暴，因为怕百姓用石头打他们。
{Act 5:27}  And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them,
{Act 5:27}  带到了，便叫使徒站在公会前；大祭司问他们说：
{Act 5:28}  saying, "We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
{Act 5:28}  “我们不是严严的禁止你们，不可奉这名教训人吗？你们倒把你们的道理充满了耶路撒冷，想要叫这人的血归到我们身上！”
{Act 5:29}  But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.
{Act 5:29}  彼得和众使徒回答说：“顺从神，不顺从人，是应当的。
{Act 5:30}  The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.
{Act 5:30}  你们挂在木头上杀害的耶稣，我们祖宗的神已经叫他复活。
{Act 5:31}  God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
{Act 5:31}  神且用右手将他高举（或作：他就是神高举在自己的右边），叫他作君王，作救主，将悔改的心和赦罪的恩赐给以色列人。
{Act 5:32}  And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."
{Act 5:32}  我们为这事作见证；神赐给顺从之人的圣灵也为这事作见证。”
{Act 5:33}  When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them.
{Act 5:33}  公会的人听见就极其恼怒，想要杀他们。
{Act 5:34}  But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while.
{Act 5:34}  但有一个法利赛人，名叫迦玛列，是众百姓所敬重的教法师，在公会中站起来，吩咐人把使徒暂且带到外面去，
{Act 5:35}  And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men.
{Act 5:35}  就对众人说：“以色列人哪，论到这些人，你们应当小心怎样办理。
{Act 5:36}  For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.
{Act 5:36}  从前丢大起来，自夸为大；附从他的人约有四百，他被杀后，附从他的全都散了，归于无有。
{Act 5:37}  After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered.
{Act 5:37}  此后，报名上册的时候，又有加利利的犹大起来，引诱些百姓跟从他；他也灭亡，附从他的人也都四散了。
{Act 5:38}  So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or this undertaking is of man, it will fail;
{Act 5:38}  现在，我劝你们不要管这些人，任凭他们吧！他们所谋的、所行的，若是出于人，必要败坏；
{Act 5:39}  but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!" So they took his advice,
{Act 5:39}  若是出于神，你们就不能败坏他们，恐怕你们倒是攻击神了。”
{Act 5:40}  and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
{Act 5:40}  公会的人听从了他，便叫使徒来，把他们打了，又吩咐他们不可奉耶稣的名讲道，就把他们释放了。
{Act 5:41}  Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name.
{Act 5:41}  他们离开公会，心里欢喜，因被算是配为这名受辱。
{Act 5:42}  And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching that the Christ is Jesus.
{Act 5:42}  他们就每日在殿里、在家里、不住的教训人，传耶稣是基督。
{Act 6:1}   Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.
{Act 6:1}   那时，门徒增多，有说希利尼话的犹太人向希伯来人发怨言，因为在天天的供给上忽略了他们的寡妇。
{Act 6:2}   And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, "It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables.
{Act 6:2}   十二使徒叫众门徒来，对他们说：“我们撇下神的道去管理饭食，原是不合宜的。
{Act 6:3}   Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty.
{Act 6:3}   所以弟兄们，当从你们中间选出七个有好名声、被圣灵充满、智慧充足的人，我们就派他们管理这事。
{Act 6:4}   But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word."
{Act 6:4}   但我们要专心以祈祷、传道为事。”
{Act 6:5}   And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch.
{Act 6:5}   大众都喜悦这话，就拣选了司提反，乃是大有信心、圣灵充满的人，又拣选腓利、伯罗哥罗、尼迦挪、提门、巴米拿，并进犹太教的安提阿人尼哥拉，
{Act 6:6}   These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them.
{Act 6:6}   叫他们站在使徒面前。使徒祷告了，就按手在他们头上。
{Act 6:7}   And the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.
{Act 6:7}   神的道兴旺起来；在耶路撒冷门徒数目加增的甚多，也有许多祭司信从了这道。
{Act 6:8}   And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.
{Act 6:8}   司提反满得恩惠、能力，在民间行了大奇事和神迹。
{Act 6:9}   Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen.
{Act 6:9}   当时有称利百地拿会堂的几个人，并有古利奈、亚力山大、基利家、亚西亚、各处会堂的几个人，都起来和司提反辩论。
{Act 6:10}  But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.
{Act 6:10}  司提反是以智慧和圣灵说话，众人敌挡不住，
{Act 6:11}  Then they secretly instigated men who said, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."
{Act 6:11}  就买出人来说：“我们听见他说谤渎摩西和神的话。”
{Act 6:12}  And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council,
{Act 6:12}  他们又耸动了百姓、长老，并文士，就忽然来捉拿他，把他带到公会去，
{Act 6:13}  and they set up false witnesses who said, "This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law,
{Act 6:13}  设下假见证，说：“这个人说话，不住的糟践圣所和律法。
{Act 6:14}  for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us."
{Act 6:14}  我们曾听见他说：这拿撒勒人耶稣要毁坏此地，也要改变摩西所交给我们的规条。”
{Act 6:15}  And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
{Act 6:15}  在公会里坐着的人都定睛看他，见他的面貌，好像天使的面貌。
{Act 7:1}   And the high priest said, "Are these things so?"
{Act 7:1}   大祭司就说：‘这些事果然有吗？’
{Act 7:2}   And Stephen said: "Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
{Act 7:2}   司提反说：“诸位父兄请听！当日我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕在米所波大米还未住哈兰的时候，荣耀的神向他显现，
{Act 7:3}   and said to him, 'Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.'
{Act 7:3}   对他说：‘你要离开本地和亲族，往我所要指示你的地方去。’
{Act 7:4}   Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living.
{Act 7:4}   他就离开迦勒底人之地，住在哈兰。他父亲死了以后，神使他从那里搬到你们现在所住之地。
{Act 7:5}   Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child.
{Act 7:5}   在这地方，神并没有给他产业，连立足之地也没有给他；但应许要将这地赐给他和他的后裔为业；那时他还没有儿子。
{Act 7:6}   And God spoke to this effect--that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years.
{Act 7:6}   神说：‘他的后裔必寄居外邦，那里的人要叫他们作奴仆，苦待他们四百年。’
{Act 7:7}   'But I will judge the nation that they serve,' said God, 'and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.'
{Act 7:7}   神又说：‘使他们作奴仆的那国，我要惩罚。以后他们要出来，在这地方事奉我。’
{Act 7:8}   And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.
{Act 7:8}   神又赐他割礼的约。于是亚伯拉罕生了以撒，第八日给他行了割礼。以撒生雅各，雅各生十二位先祖。
{Act 7:9}   "And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him
{Act 7:9}   先祖嫉妒约瑟，把他卖到埃及去；神却与他同在，
{Act 7:10}  and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household.
{Act 7:10}  救他脱离一切苦难，又使他在埃及王法老面前得恩典，有智慧。法老就派他作埃及国的宰相兼管全家。
{Act 7:11}  Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food.
{Act 7:11}  后来埃及和迦南全地遭遇饥荒，大受艰难，我们的祖宗就绝了粮。
{Act 7:12}  But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit.
{Act 7:12}  雅各听见在埃及有粮，就打发我们的祖宗初次往那里去。
{Act 7:13}  And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.
{Act 7:13}  第二次约瑟与弟兄们相认，他的亲族也被法老知道了。
{Act 7:14}  And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all.
{Act 7:14}  约瑟就打发弟兄请父亲雅各和全家七十五个人都来。
{Act 7:15}  And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers,
{Act 7:15}  于是雅各下了埃及，后来他和我们的祖宗都死在那里；
{Act 7:16}  and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
{Act 7:16}  又被带到示剑，葬于亚伯拉罕在示剑用银子从哈抹子孙买来的坟墓里。
{Act 7:17}  "But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt
{Act 7:17}  “及至神应许亚伯拉罕的日期将到，以色列民在埃及兴盛众多，
{Act 7:18}  until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph.
{Act 7:18}  直到有不晓得约瑟的新王兴起。
{Act 7:19}  He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive.
{Act 7:19}  他用诡计待我们的宗族，苦害我们的祖宗，叫他们丢弃婴孩，使婴孩不能存活。
{Act 7:20}  At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God's sight. And he was brought up for three months in his father's house,
{Act 7:20}  那时，摩西生下来，俊美非凡，在他父亲家里抚养了三个月。
{Act 7:21}  and when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.
{Act 7:21}  他被丢弃的时候，法老的女儿拾了去，养为自己的儿子。
{Act 7:22}  And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.
{Act 7:22}  摩西学了埃及人一切的学问，说话行事都有才能。
{Act 7:23}  "When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.
{Act 7:23}  “他将到四十岁，心中起意去看望他的弟兄以色列人；
{Act 7:24}  And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian.
{Act 7:24}  到了那里，见他们一个人受冤屈，就护庇他，为那受欺压的人报仇，打死了那埃及人。
{Act 7:25}  He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand.
{Act 7:25}  他以为弟兄必明白神是藉他的手搭救他们；他们却不明白。
{Act 7:26}  And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, 'Men, you are brothers. Why do you wrong each other?'
{Act 7:26}  第二天，遇见两个以色列人争斗，就劝他们和睦，说：‘你们二位是弟兄，为什么彼此欺负呢？’
{Act 7:27}  But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
{Act 7:27}  那欺负邻舍的把他推开，说：‘谁立你作我们的首领和审判官呢？
{Act 7:28}  Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'
{Act 7:28}  难道你要杀我，像昨天杀那埃及人么？’
{Act 7:29}  At this retort Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.
{Act 7:29}  摩西听见这话就逃走了，寄居于米甸；在那里生了两个儿子。
{Act 7:30}  "Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
{Act 7:30}  “过了四十年，在西乃山的旷野，有一位天使从荆棘火焰中向摩西显现。
{Act 7:31}  When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and as he drew near to look, there came the voice of the Lord:
{Act 7:31}  摩西见了那异象，便觉希奇，正进前观看的时候，有主的声音说：
{Act 7:32}  'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.' And Moses trembled and did not dare to look.
{Act 7:32}  ‘我是你列祖的神，就是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。’摩西战战兢兢，不敢观看。
{Act 7:33}  Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
{Act 7:33}  主对他说：‘把你脚上的鞋脱下来；因为你所站之地是圣地。
{Act 7:34}  I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.'
{Act 7:34}  我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了，他们悲叹的声音，我也听见了。我下来要救他们。你来！我要差你往埃及去。’
{Act 7:35}  "This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'--this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
{Act 7:35}  这摩西就是百姓弃绝说‘谁立你作我们的首领和审判官’的；神却藉那在荆棘中显现之使者的手差派他作首领、作救赎的。
{Act 7:36}  This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.
{Act 7:36}  这人领百姓出来，在埃及，在红海、在旷野，四十年间行了奇事神迹。
{Act 7:37}  This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, 'God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.'
{Act 7:37}  那曾对以色列人说‘神要从你们弟兄中间给你们兴起一位先知像我’的，就是这位摩西。
{Act 7:38}  This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us.
{Act 7:38}  这人曾在旷野会中和西乃山上，与那对他说话的天使同在，又与我们的祖宗同在，并且领受活泼的圣言传给我们。
{Act 7:39}  Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt,
{Act 7:39}  我们的祖宗不肯听从，反弃绝他，心里归向埃及，
{Act 7:40}  saying to Aaron, 'Make for us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'
{Act 7:40}  对亚伦说：‘你且为我们造些神像，在我们前面引路；因为领我们出埃及地的那个摩西，我们不知道他遭了什么事。’
{Act 7:41}  And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands.
{Act 7:41}  那时，他们造了一个牛犊，又拿祭物献给那像，欢喜自己手中的工作。
{Act 7:42}  But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: "'Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices, during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
{Act 7:42}  神就转脸不顾，任凭他们事奉天上的日月星辰，正如先知书上所写的说：以色列家啊，你们四十年间在旷野，岂是将牺牲和祭物献给我吗？
{Act 7:43}  You took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan, the images that you made to worship; and I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.'
{Act 7:43}  你们抬着摩洛的帐幕和理番神的星，就是你们所造为要敬拜的像。因此，我要把你们迁到巴比伦外去。
{Act 7:44}  "Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen.
{Act 7:44}  “我们的祖宗在旷野，有法柜的帐幕，是神吩咐摩西叫他照所看见的样式做的。
{Act 7:45}  Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers. So it was until the days of David,
{Act 7:45}  这帐幕，我们的祖宗相继承受。当神在他们面前赶出外邦人去的时候，他们同约书亚把帐幕搬进承受为业之地，直存到大卫的日子。
{Act 7:46}  who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
{Act 7:46}  大卫在神面前蒙恩，祈求为雅各的神预备居所；
{Act 7:47}  But it was Solomon who built a house for him.
{Act 7:47}  却是所罗门为神造成殿宇。
{Act 7:48}  Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands, as the prophet says,
{Act 7:48}  其实，至高者并不住人手所造的，就如先知所言：
{Act 7:49}  "'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?
{Act 7:49}  主说：天是我的座位，地是我的脚凳；你们要为我造何等的殿宇？那里是我安息的地方呢？
{Act 7:50}  Did not my hand make all these things?'
{Act 7:50}  这一切不都是我手所造的吗？
{Act 7:51}  "You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you.
{Act 7:51}  “你们这硬着颈项、心与耳未受割礼的人，常时抗拒圣灵！你们的祖宗怎样，你们也怎样。
{Act 7:52}  Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered,
{Act 7:52}  那一个先知不是你们祖宗逼迫呢？他们也把预先传说那义者要来的人杀了；如今你们又把那义者卖了，杀了。
{Act 7:53}  you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it."
{Act 7:53}  你们受了天使所传的律法，竟不遵守。”
{Act 7:54}  Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth at him.
{Act 7:54}  众人听见这话就极其恼怒，向司提反咬牙切齿。
{Act 7:55}  But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
{Act 7:55}  但司提反被圣灵充满，定睛望天，看见神的荣耀，又看见耶稣站在神的右边，
{Act 7:56}  And he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."
{Act 7:56}  就说：“我看见天开了，人子站在神的右边。”
{Act 7:57}  But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together at him.
{Act 7:57}  众人大声喊叫，捂着耳朵，齐心拥上前去，
{Act 7:58}  Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
{Act 7:58}  把他推到城外，用石头打他。作见证的人把衣裳放在一个少年人名叫扫罗的脚前。
{Act 7:59}  And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
{Act 7:59}  他们正用石头打的时候，司提反呼吁主说：“求主耶稣接收我的灵魂！”
{Act 7:60}  And falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
{Act 7:60}  又跪下大声喊着说：“主啊，不要将这罪归于他们！”说了这话，就睡了。扫罗也喜悦他被害。
{Act 8:1}   And Saul approved of his execution. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
{Act 8:1}   从这日起，耶路撒冷的教会大遭逼迫，除了使徒以外，门徒都分散在犹太和撒玛利亚各处。
{Act 8:2}   Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
{Act 8:2}   有虔诚的人把司提反埋葬了，为他捶胸大哭。
{Act 8:3}   But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.
{Act 8:3}   扫罗却残害教会，进各人的家，拉着男女下在监里。
{Act 8:4}   Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word.
{Act 8:4}   那些分散的人往各处去传道。
{Act 8:5}   Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.
{Act 8:5}   腓利下撒玛利亚城去，宣讲基督。
{Act 8:6}   And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip when they heard him and saw the signs that he did.
{Act 8:6}   众人听见了，又看见腓利所行的神迹，就同心合意的听从他的话。
{Act 8:7}   For unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who had them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
{Act 8:7}   因为有许多人被污鬼附着，那些鬼大声呼叫，从他们身上出来；还有许多瘫痪的，瘸腿的，都得了医治。
{Act 8:8}   So there was much joy in that city.
{Act 8:8}   在那城里，就大有欢喜。
{Act 8:9}   But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great.
{Act 8:9}   有一个人，名叫西门，向来在那城里行邪术，妄自尊大，使撒玛利亚的百姓惊奇；
{Act 8:10}  They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the power of God that is called Great."
{Act 8:10}  无论大小都听从他，说：“这人就是那称为神的大能者。”
{Act 8:11}  And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.
{Act 8:11}  他们听从他，因他久用邪术，使他们惊奇。
{Act 8:12}  But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
{Act 8:12}  及至他们信了腓利所传神国的福音和耶稣基督的名，连男带女就受了洗。
{Act 8:13}  Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.
{Act 8:13}  西门自己也信了；既受了洗，就常与腓利在一处，看见他所行的神迹和大异能，就甚惊奇。
{Act 8:14}  Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,
{Act 8:14}  使徒在耶路撒冷听见撒玛利亚人领受了神的道，就打发彼得、约翰往他们那里去。
{Act 8:15}  who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
{Act 8:15}  两个人到了，就为他们祷告，要叫他们受圣灵。
{Act 8:16}  for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
{Act 8:16}  因为圣灵还没有降在他们一个人身上，他们只奉主耶稣的名受了洗。
{Act 8:17}  Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.
{Act 8:17}  于是使徒按手在他们头上，他们就受了圣灵。
{Act 8:18}  Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
{Act 8:18}  西门看见使徒按手，便有圣灵赐下，就拿钱给使徒，
{Act 8:19}  saying, "Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
{Act 8:19}  说：“把这权柄也给我，叫我手按着谁，谁就可以受圣灵。”
{Act 8:20}  But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
{Act 8:20}  彼得说：“你的银子和你一同灭亡吧！因你想神的恩赐是可以用钱买的。
{Act 8:21}  You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.
{Act 8:21}  你在这道上无分无关；因为在神面前，你的心不正。
{Act 8:22}  Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.
{Act 8:22}  你当懊悔你这罪恶，祈求主，或者你心里的意念可得赦免。
{Act 8:23}  For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity."
{Act 8:23}  我看出你正在苦胆之中，被罪恶捆绑。”
{Act 8:24}  And Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."
{Act 8:24}  西门说：愿你们为我求主，叫你们所说的，没有一样临到我身上。
{Act 8:25}  Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
{Act 8:25}  使徒既证明主道，而且传讲，就回耶路撒冷去，一路在撒玛利亚好些村庄传扬福音。
{Act 8:26}  Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." This is a desert place.
{Act 8:26}  有主的一个使者对腓利说：“起来！向南走，往那从耶路撒冷下迦萨的路上去。”那路是旷野。
{Act 8:27}  And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship
{Act 8:27}  腓利就起身去了，不料，有一个埃提阿伯（就是古实，见以赛亚十八章一节）人，是个有大权的太监，在埃提阿伯女王干大基的手下总管银库，他上耶路撒冷礼拜去了。
{Act 8:28}  and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.
{Act 8:28}  现在回来，在车上坐着，念先知以赛亚的书。
{Act 8:29}  And the Spirit said to Philip, "Go over and join this chariot."
{Act 8:29}  圣灵对腓利说：“你去！贴近那车走。”
{Act 8:30}  So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
{Act 8:30}  腓利就跑到太监那里，听见他念先知以赛亚的书，便问他说：“你所念的，你明白吗？”
{Act 8:31}  And he said, "How can I, unless someone guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
{Act 8:31}  他说：“没有人指教我，怎能明白呢？”于是请腓利上车，与他同坐。
{Act 8:32}  Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: "Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he opens not his mouth.
{Act 8:32}  他所念的那段经，说：他像羊被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊羔在剪毛的人手下无声；他也是这样不开口。
{Act 8:33}  In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth."
{Act 8:33}  他卑微的时候，人不按公义审判他（原文作他的审判被夺去）；谁能述说他的世代，因为他的生命从地上夺去。’
{Act 8:34}  And the eunuch said to Philip, "About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?"
{Act 8:34}  太监对腓利说：“请问，先知说这话是指着谁？是指着自己呢？是指着别人呢？”
{Act 8:35}  Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus.
{Act 8:35}  腓利就开口从这经上起，对他传讲耶稣。
{Act 8:36}  And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?"
{Act 8:36}  二人正往前走，到了有水的地方，太监说：“看哪，这里有水，我受洗有什么妨碍呢？”（有古卷在此有
{Act 8:37}  And Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” And he replied, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”
{Act 8:37}  腓利说：“你若是一心相信，就可以。”他回答说：“我信耶稣基督是神的儿子。”）
{Act 8:38}  And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
{Act 8:38}  于是吩咐车站住，腓利和太监二人同下水里去，腓利就给他施洗。
{Act 8:39}  And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.
{Act 8:39}  从水里上来，主的灵把腓利提了去，太监也不再见他了，就欢欢喜喜的走路。
{Act 8:40}  But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
{Act 8:40}  后来有人在亚锁都遇见腓利；他走遍那地方，在各城宣传福音，直到该撒利亚。
{Act 9:1}   But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
{Act 9:1}   扫罗仍然向主的门徒口吐威吓凶杀的话，去见大祭司，
{Act 9:2}   and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
{Act 9:2}   求文书给大马色的各会堂，若是找着信奉这道的人，无论男女，都准他捆绑带到耶路撒冷。
{Act 9:3}   Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him.
{Act 9:3}   扫罗行路，将到大马色，忽然从天上发光，四面照着他；
{Act 9:4}   And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"
{Act 9:4}   他就仆倒在地，听见有声音对他说：“扫罗！扫罗！你为什么逼迫我？”
{Act 9:5}   And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
{Act 9:5}   他说：“主啊！你是谁？”主说：“我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。
{Act 9:6}   But rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do."
{Act 9:6}   起来！进城去，你所当作的事，必有人告诉你。”
{Act 9:7}   The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
{Act 9:7}   同行的人站在那里，说不出话来，听见声音，却看不见人。
{Act 9:8}   Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
{Act 9:8}   扫罗从地上起来，睁开眼睛，竟不能看见什么。有人拉他的手，领他进了大马色；
{Act 9:9}   And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
{Act 9:9}   三日不能看见，也不吃也不喝。
{Act 9:10}  Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." And he said, "Here I am, Lord."
{Act 9:10}  当下，在大马色有一个门徒，名叫亚拿尼亚。主在异象中对他说：“亚拿尼亚。”他说：“主，我在这里。”
{Act 9:11}  And the Lord said to him, "Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,
{Act 9:11}  主对他说：“起来！往直街去，在犹大的家里，访问一个大数人，名叫扫罗。他正祷告，
{Act 9:12}  and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight."
{Act 9:12}  又看见了一个人，名叫亚拿尼亚，进来按手在他身上，叫他能看见。”
{Act 9:13}  But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem.
{Act 9:13}  亚拿尼亚回答说：“主啊，我听见许多人说：这人怎样在耶路撒冷多多苦害你的圣徒，
{Act 9:14}  And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name."
{Act 9:14}  并且他在这里有从祭司长得来的权柄捆绑一切求告你名的人。”
{Act 9:15}  But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.
{Act 9:15}  主对亚拿尼亚说：“你只管去！他是我所拣选的器皿，要在外邦人和君王，并以色列人面前宣扬我的名。
{Act 9:16}  For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name."
{Act 9:16}  我也要指示他，为我的名必须受许多的苦难。”
{Act 9:17}  So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
{Act 9:17}  亚拿尼亚就去了，进入那家，把手按在扫罗身上，说：“兄弟扫罗，在你来的路上，向你显现的主，就是耶稣，打发我来，叫你能看见，又被圣灵充满。”
{Act 9:18}  And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized;
{Act 9:18}  扫罗的眼睛上，好像有鳞立刻掉下来，他就能看见。于是起来受了洗；
{Act 9:19}  and taking food, he was strengthened. For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus.
{Act 9:19}  吃过饭就健壮了。扫罗和大马色的门徒同住了些日子，
{Act 9:20}  And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God."
{Act 9:20}  就在各会堂里宣传耶稣，说他是神的儿子。
{Act 9:21}  And all who heard him were amazed and said, "Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?"
{Act 9:21}  凡听见的人都惊奇，说：“在耶路撒冷残害求告这名的，不是这人吗？并且他到这里来，特要捆绑他们，带到祭司长那里。”
{Act 9:22}  But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.
{Act 9:22}  但扫罗越发有能力，驳倒住大马色的犹太人，证明耶稣是基督。
{Act 9:23}  When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,
{Act 9:23}  过了好些日子，犹太人商议要杀扫罗，
{Act 9:24}  but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him,
{Act 9:24}  但他们的计谋被扫罗知道了。他们又昼夜在城门守候，要杀他。
{Act 9:25}  but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.
{Act 9:25}  他的门徒就在夜间用筐子把他从城墙上缒下去。
{Act 9:26}  And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.
{Act 9:26}  扫罗到了耶路撒冷，想与门徒结交，他们却都怕他，不信他是门徒。
{Act 9:27}  But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
{Act 9:27}  惟有巴拿巴接待他，领去见使徒，把他在路上怎么看见主，主怎么向他说话，他在大马色怎么奉耶稣的名放胆传道，都述说出来。
{Act 9:28}  So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord.
{Act 9:28}  于是扫罗在耶路撒冷和门徒出入来往，
{Act 9:29}  And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists. But they were seeking to kill him.
{Act 9:29}  奉主的名放胆传道，并与说希利尼话的犹太人讲论辩驳；他们却想法子要杀他。
{Act 9:30}  And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
{Act 9:30}  弟兄们知道了就送他下该撒利亚，打发他往大数去。
{Act 9:31}  So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied.
{Act 9:31}  那时，犹太加利利、撒玛利亚各处的教会都得平安，被建立；凡事敬畏主，蒙圣灵的安慰，人数就增多了。
{Act 9:32}  Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.
{Act 9:32}  彼得周流四方的时候，也到了居住吕大的圣徒那里；
{Act 9:33}  There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed.
{Act 9:33}  遇见一个人，名叫以尼雅，得了瘫痪，在褥子上躺卧八年。
{Act 9:34}  And Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed." And immediately he rose.
{Act 9:34}  彼得对他说：“以尼雅，耶稣基督医好你了；起来！收拾你的褥子。”他就立刻起来了。
{Act 9:35}  And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
{Act 9:35}  凡住吕大和沙仑的人都看见了他，就归服主。
{Act 9:36}  Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity.
{Act 9:36}  在约帕有一个女徒，名叫大比大，翻希利尼话就是多加（就是羚羊的意思）；他广行善事，多施周济。
{Act 9:37}  In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.
{Act 9:37}  当时，他患病而死，有人把他洗了，停在楼上。
{Act 9:38}  Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, "Please come to us without delay."
{Act 9:38}  吕大原与约帕相近；门徒听见彼得在那里，就打发两个人去见他，央求他说：“快到我们那里去，不要耽延。”
{Act 9:39}  So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.
{Act 9:39}  彼得就起身和他们同去；到了，便有人领他上楼。众寡妇都站在彼得旁边哭，拿多加与他们同在时所做的里衣外衣给他看。
{Act 9:40}  But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, arise." And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.
{Act 9:40}  彼得叫他们都出去，就跪下祷告，转身对着死人说：“大比大，起来！”他就睁开眼睛，见了彼得，便坐起来。
{Act 9:41}  And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
{Act 9:41}  彼得伸手扶他起来，叫众圣徒和寡妇进去，把多加活活的交给他们。
{Act 9:42}  And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
{Act 9:42}  这事传遍了约帕，就有许多人信了主。
{Act 9:43}  And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.
{Act 9:43}  此后，彼得在约帕一个硝皮匠西门的家里住了多日。
{Act 10:1}  At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort,
{Act 10:1}  在该撒利亚有一个人，名叫哥尼流，是“义大利营”的百夫长。
{Act 10:2}  a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God.
{Act 10:2}  他是个虔诚人，他和全家都敬畏神，多多周济百姓，常常祷告神。
{Act 10:3}  About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, "Cornelius."
{Act 10:3}  有一天，约在申初，他在异象中明明看见神的一个使者进去，到他那里，说：“哥尼流。”
{Act 10:4}  And he stared at him in terror and said, "What is it, Lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.
{Act 10:4}  哥尼流定睛看他，惊怕说：“主啊，什么事呢？”天使说：“你的祷告和你的周济达到神面前，已蒙记念了。
{Act 10:5}  And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter.
{Act 10:5}  现在你当打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来。
{Act 10:6}  He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea."
{Act 10:6}  他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里，房子在海边上。”
{Act 10:7}  When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him,
{Act 10:7}  向他说话的天使去后，哥尼流叫了两个家人和常伺候他的一个虔诚兵来，
{Act 10:8}  and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
{Act 10:8}  把这事都述说给他们听，就打发他们往约帕去。
{Act 10:9}  The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.
{Act 10:9}  第二天，他们行路将近那城。彼得约在午正，上房顶去祷告，
{Act 10:10} And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance
{Act 10:10} 觉得饿了，想要吃。那家的人正预备饭的时候，彼得魂游象外，
{Act 10:11} and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth.
{Act 10:11} 看见天开了，有一物降下，好像一块大布，系着四角，缒在地上，
{Act 10:12} In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.
{Act 10:12} 里面有地上各样四足的走兽和昆虫，并天上的飞鸟；
{Act 10:13} And there came a voice to him: "Rise, Peter; kill and eat."
{Act 10:13} 又有声音向他说：“彼得，起来，宰了吃！”
{Act 10:14} But Peter said, "By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."
{Act 10:14} 彼得却说：“主啊，这是不可的！凡俗物和不洁净的物，我从来没有吃过。”
{Act 10:15} And the voice came to him again a second time, "What God has made clean, do not call common."
{Act 10:15} 第二次有声音向他说：“神所洁净的，你不可当作俗物。”
{Act 10:16} This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.
{Act 10:16} 这样一连三次，那物随即收回天上去了。
{Act 10:17} Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate
{Act 10:17} 彼得心里正在猜疑之间，不知所看见的异象是什么意思。哥尼流所差来的人已经访问到西门的家，站在门外，
{Act 10:18} and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.
{Act 10:18} 喊着问：“有称呼彼得的西门住在这里没有？”
{Act 10:19} And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you.
{Act 10:19} 彼得还思想那异象的时候，圣灵向他说：“有三个人来找你。”
{Act 10:20} Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them."
{Act 10:20} 起来，下去，和他们同往，不要疑惑，因为是我差他们来的。”
{Act 10:21} And Peter went down to the men and said, "I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?"
{Act 10:21} 于是彼得下去见那些人，说：“我就是你们所找的人。你们来是为什么缘故？”
{Act 10:22} And they said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say."
{Act 10:22} 他们说：“百夫长哥尼流是个义人，敬畏神，为犹太通国所称赞。他蒙一位圣天使指示，叫他请你到他家里去，听你的话。”
{Act 10:23} So he invited them in to be his guests. The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
{Act 10:23} 彼得就请他们进去，住了一宿。次日，起身和他们同去，还有约帕的几个弟兄同着他去；
{Act 10:24} And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
{Act 10:24} 又次日，他们进入该撒利亚，哥尼流已经请了他的亲属密友等候他们。
{Act 10:25} When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him.
{Act 10:25} 彼得一进去，哥尼流就迎接他，俯伏在他脚前拜他。
{Act 10:26} But Peter lifted him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am a man."
{Act 10:26} 彼得却拉他，说：“你起来，我也是人。”
{Act 10:27} And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered.
{Act 10:27} 彼得和他说着话进去，见有好些人在那里聚集，
{Act 10:28} And he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean.
{Act 10:28} 就对他们说：“你们知道，犹太人和别国的人亲近来往本是不合例的，但神已经指示我，无论什么人都不可看作俗而不洁净的。
{Act 10:29} So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me."
{Act 10:29} 所以我被请的时候，就不推辞而来。现在请问：你们叫我来有什么意思呢？”
{Act 10:30} And Cornelius said, "Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing
{Act 10:30} 哥尼流说：“前四天，这个时候，我在家中守着申初的祷告，忽然有一个人穿着光明的衣裳，站在我面前，
{Act 10:31} and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
{Act 10:31} 说：‘哥尼流，你的祷告已蒙垂听，你的周济达到神面前已蒙记念了。
{Act 10:32} Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.'
{Act 10:32} 你当打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来，他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里。’
{Act 10:33} So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord."
{Act 10:33} 所以我立时打发人去请你。你来了很好；现今我们都在神面前，要听主所吩咐你的一切话。”
{Act 10:34} So Peter opened his mouth and said: "Truly I understand that God shows no partiality,
{Act 10:34} 彼得就开口说：“我真看出神是不偏待人。
{Act 10:35} but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.
{Act 10:35} 原来，各国中那敬畏主、行义的人都为主所悦纳。
{Act 10:36} As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),
{Act 10:36} 神藉着耶稣基督（他是万有的主）传和平的福音，将这道赐给以色列人。
{Act 10:37} you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed:
{Act 10:37} 这话在约翰宣传洗礼以后，从加利利起，传遍了犹太。
{Act 10:38} how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
{Act 10:38} 神怎样以圣灵和能力膏拿撒勒人耶稣，这都是你们知道的。他周流四方，行善事，医好凡被魔鬼压制的人，因为神与他同在。
{Act 10:39} And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree,
{Act 10:39} 他在犹太人之地，并耶路撒冷所行的一切事，有我们作见证。他们竟把他挂在木头上杀了。
{Act 10:40} but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear,
{Act 10:40} 第三日，神叫他复活，显现出来；
{Act 10:41} not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
{Act 10:41} 不是显现给众人看，乃是显现给神预先所拣选为他作见证的人看，就是我们这些在他从死里复活以后和他同吃同喝的人。
{Act 10:42} And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.
{Act 10:42} 他吩咐我们传道给众人，证明他是神所立定的，要作审判活人、死人的主。
{Act 10:43} To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."
{Act 10:43} 众先知也为他作见证说：‘凡信他的人必因他的名得蒙赦罪。’”
{Act 10:44} While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.
{Act 10:44} 彼得还说这话的时候，圣灵降在一切听道的人身上。
{Act 10:45} And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles.
{Act 10:45} 那些奉割礼、和彼得同来的信徒，见圣灵的恩赐也浇在外邦人身上，就都希奇；
{Act 10:46} For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared,
{Act 10:46} 因听见他们说方言，称赞神为大。
{Act 10:47} "Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"
{Act 10:47} 于是彼得说：“这些人既受了圣灵，与我们一样，谁能禁止用水给他们施洗呢？”
{Act 10:48} And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.
{Act 10:48} 就吩咐奉耶稣基督的名给他们施洗。他们又请彼得住了几天。
{Act 11:1}  Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
{Act 11:1}  使徒和在犹太的众弟兄听说外邦人也领受了神的道。
{Act 11:2}  So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying,
{Act 11:2}  及至彼得上了耶路撒冷，那些奉割礼的门徒和他争辩说：
{Act 11:3}  "You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them."
{Act 11:3}  “你进入未受割礼之人的家和他们一同吃饭了。”
{Act 11:4}  But Peter began and explained it to them in order:
{Act 11:4}  彼得就开口把这事挨次给他们讲解说：
{Act 11:5}  "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me.
{Act 11:5}  “我在约帕城里祷告的时候，魂游象外，看见异象，有一物降下，好像一块大布，系着四角，从天缒下，直来到我跟前。”
{Act 11:6}  Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air.
{Act 11:6}  我定睛观看，见内中有地上四足的牲畜和野兽、昆虫，并天上的飞鸟。
{Act 11:7}  And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'
{Act 11:7}  我且听见有声音向我说：‘彼得，起来，宰了吃！’
{Act 11:8}  But I said, 'By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
{Act 11:8}  我说：‘主啊，这是不可的！凡俗而不洁净的物从来没有入过我的口。’
{Act 11:9}  But the voice answered a second time from heaven, 'What God has made clean, do not call common.'
{Act 11:9}  第二次，有声音从天上说：神所洁净的，你不可当作俗物。
{Act 11:10} This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.
{Act 11:10} 这样一连三次，就都收回天上去了。
{Act 11:11} And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea.
{Act 11:11} 正当那时，有三个人站在我们所住的房门前，是从该撒利亚差来见我的。
{Act 11:12} And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.
{Act 11:12} 圣灵吩咐我和他们同去，不要疑惑。（或作：不要分别等类）。同着我去的，还有这六位弟兄；我们都进了那人的家，
{Act 11:13} And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter;
{Act 11:13} 那人就告诉我们，他如何看见一位天使，站在他屋里，说：你打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来；’
{Act 11:14} he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'
{Act 11:14} 他有话告诉你，可以叫你和你的全家得救。
{Act 11:15} As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning.
{Act 11:15} 我一开讲，圣灵便降在他们身上，正像当初降在我们身上一样。
{Act 11:16} And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
{Act 11:16} 我就想起主的话说：‘约翰是用水施洗，但你们要受圣灵的洗。’
{Act 11:17} If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?"
{Act 11:17} 神既然给他们恩赐，像在我们信主耶稣基督的时候给了我们一样；我是谁，能拦阻神呢！”
{Act 11:18} When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, "Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life."
{Act 11:18} 众人听见这话，就不言语了，只归荣耀与神，说：“这样看来，神也赐恩给外邦人，叫他们悔改得生命了。”
{Act 11:19} Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.
{Act 11:19} 那些因司提反的事遭患难四散的门徒直走到腓尼基和居比路，并安提阿；他们不向别人讲道，只向犹太人讲。
{Act 11:20} But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus.
{Act 11:20} 但内中有居比路和古利奈人，他们到了安提阿也向希利尼人传讲主耶稣（有古卷：也向说希利尼话的犹太人传讲主耶稣）。
{Act 11:21} And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.
{Act 11:21} 主与他们同在，信而归主的人就很多了。
{Act 11:22} The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
{Act 11:22} 这风声传到耶路撒冷教会人的耳中，他们就打发巴拿巴出去，走到安提阿为止。
{Act 11:23} When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose,
{Act 11:23} 他到了那里，看见神所赐的恩就欢喜，劝勉众人，立定心志，恒久靠主。
{Act 11:24} for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.
{Act 11:24} 这巴拿巴原是个好人，被圣灵充满，大有信心。于是有许多人归服了主。
{Act 11:25} So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
{Act 11:25} 他又往大数去找扫罗，
{Act 11:26} and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.
{Act 11:26} 找着了，就带他到安提阿去。他们足有一年的工夫和教会一同聚集，教训了许多人。门徒称为“基督徒”是从安提阿起首。
{Act 11:27} Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
{Act 11:27} 当那些日子，有几位先知从耶路撒冷下到安提阿。
{Act 11:28} And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius).
{Act 11:28} 内中有一位，名叫亚迦布，站起来，藉着圣灵指明天下将有大饥荒（这事到革老丢年间果然有了。）
{Act 11:29} So the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.
{Act 11:29} 于是门徒定意照各人的力量捐钱，送去供给住在犹太的弟兄。
{Act 11:30} And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
{Act 11:30} 他们就这样行，把捐项托巴拿巴和扫罗送到众长老那里。
{Act 12:1}  About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church.
{Act 12:1}  那时，希律王下手苦害教会中几个人，
{Act 12:2}  He killed James the brother of John with the sword,
{Act 12:2}  用刀杀了约翰的哥哥雅各。
{Act 12:3}  and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread.
{Act 12:3}  他见犹太人喜欢这事，又去捉拿彼得。那时正是除酵的日子。
{Act 12:4}  And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.
{Act 12:4}  希律拿了彼得，收在监里，交付四班兵丁看守，每班四个人，意思要在逾越节后把他提出来，当着百姓办他。
{Act 12:5}  So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.
{Act 12:5}  于是彼得被囚在监里；教会却为他切切的祷告神。
{Act 12:6}  Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.
{Act 12:6}  希律将要提他出来的前一夜，彼得被两条铁链锁着，睡在两个兵丁当中；看守的人也在门外看守。
{Act 12:7}  And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, "Get up quickly." And the chains fell off his hands.
{Act 12:7}  忽然，有主的一个使者站在旁边，屋里有光照耀，天使拍彼得的肋旁，拍醒了他，说：“快快起来！”那铁链就从他手上脱落下来。
{Act 12:8}  And the angel said to him, "Dress yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."
{Act 12:8}  天使对他说：“束上带子，穿上鞋。”他就那样做。天使又说：“披上外衣，跟着我来。”
{Act 12:9}  And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.
{Act 12:9}  彼得就出来跟着他，不知道天使所做是真的，只当见了异象。
{Act 12:10} When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him.
{Act 12:10} 过了第一层第二层监牢，就来到临街的铁门，那门自己开了。他们出来，走过一条街，天使便离开他去了。
{Act 12:11} When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting."
{Act 12:11} 彼得醒悟过来，说：“我现在真知道主差遣他的使者，救我脱离希律的手和犹太百姓一切所盼望的。”
{Act 12:12} When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.
{Act 12:12} 想了一想，就往那称呼马可的约翰、他母亲马利亚家去，在那里有好些人聚集祷告。
{Act 12:13} And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.
{Act 12:13} 彼得敲外门，有一个使女，名叫罗大，出来探听，
{Act 12:14} Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate.
{Act 12:14} 听见是彼得的声音，就欢喜的顾不得开门，跑进去告诉众人说：“彼得站在门外。”
{Act 12:15} They said to her, "You are out of your mind." But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, "It is his angel!"
{Act 12:15} 他们说：“你是疯了！”使女极力的说：“真是他！”他们说：“必是他的天使！”
{Act 12:16} But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed.
{Act 12:16} 彼得不住的敲门。他们开了门，看见他，就甚惊奇。
{Act 12:17} But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Tell these things to James and to the brothers." Then he departed and went to another place.
{Act 12:17} 彼得摆手，不要他们作声，就告诉他们主怎样领他出监；又说：“你们把这事告诉雅各和众弟兄。”于是出去，往别处去了。
{Act 12:18} Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
{Act 12:18} 到了天亮，兵丁扰乱得很，不知道彼得往那里去了。
{Act 12:19} And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.
{Act 12:19} 希律找他，找不着，就审问看守的人，吩咐把他们拉去杀了。后来希律离开犹太，下该撒利亚去，住在那里。
{Act 12:20} Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.
{Act 12:20} 希律恼怒推罗、西顿的人。他们那一带地方是从王的地土得粮，因此就托了王的内侍臣伯拉斯都的情，一心来求和。
{Act 12:21} On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them.
{Act 12:21} 希律在所定的日子，穿上朝服，坐在位上，对他们讲论一番。
{Act 12:22} And the people were shouting, "The voice of a god, and not of a man!"
{Act 12:22} 百姓喊着说：“这是神的声音，不是人的声音。”
{Act 12:23} Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.
{Act 12:23} 希律不归荣耀给神，所以主的使者立刻罚他，他被虫所咬，气就绝了。
{Act 12:24} But the word of God increased and multiplied.
{Act 12:24} 神的道日见兴旺，越发广传。
{Act 12:25} And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their service, bringing with them John, whose other name was Mark.
{Act 12:25} 巴拿巴和扫罗办完了他们供给的事，就从耶路撒冷回来，带着称呼马可的约翰同去。
{Act 13:1}  Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a lifelong friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
{Act 13:1}  在安提阿的教会中，有几位先知和教师，就是巴拿巴和称呼尼结的西面、古利奈人路求，与分封之王希律同养的马念，并扫罗。
{Act 13:2}  While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
{Act 13:2}  他们事奉主、禁食的时候，圣灵说：“要为我分派巴拿巴和扫罗，去做我召他们所做的工。”
{Act 13:3}  Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.
{Act 13:3}  于是禁食祷告，按手在他们头上，就打发他们去了。
{Act 13:4}  So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
{Act 13:4}  他们既被圣灵差遣，就下到西流基，从那里坐船往居比路去。
{Act 13:5}  When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them.
{Act 13:5}  到了撒拉米，就在犹太人各会堂里传讲神的道，也有约翰作他们的帮手。
{Act 13:6}  When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
{Act 13:6}  经过全岛，直到帕弗，在那里遇见一个有法术，假充先知的犹太人，名叫巴耶稣。
{Act 13:7}  He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
{Act 13:7}  这人常和方伯士求保罗同在。士求保罗是个通达人，他请了巴拿巴和扫罗来，要听神的道。
{Act 13:8}  But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
{Act 13:8}  只是那行法术的以吕马（这名翻出来就是行法术的意思）敌挡使徒，要叫方伯不信真道。
{Act 13:9}  But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him
{Act 13:9}  扫罗又名保罗，被圣灵充满，定睛看他，
{Act 13:10} and said, "You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?
{Act 13:10} 说：“你这充满各样诡诈奸恶，魔鬼的儿子，众善的仇敌，你混乱主的正道还不止住吗？
{Act 13:11} And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time." Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand.
{Act 13:11} 现在主的手加在你身上，你要瞎眼，暂且不见日光。”他的眼睛立刻昏蒙黑暗，四下里求人拉着手领他。
{Act 13:12} Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
{Act 13:12} 方伯看见所做的事，很希奇主的道，就信了。
{Act 13:13} Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem,
{Act 13:13} 保罗和他的同人从帕弗开船，来到旁非利亚的别加，约翰就离开他们，回耶路撒冷去。
{Act 13:14} but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
{Act 13:14} 他们离了别加往前行，来到彼西底的安提阿，在安息日进会堂坐下。
{Act 13:15} After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it."
{Act 13:15} 读完了律法和先知的书，管会堂的，叫人过去，对他们说：“二位兄台，若有什么劝勉众人的话，请说。”
{Act 13:16} So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: "Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen.
{Act 13:16} 保罗就站起来，举手，说：“以色列人和一切敬畏神的人，请听。
{Act 13:17} The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.
{Act 13:17} 这以色列民的神拣选了我们的祖宗，当民寄居埃及的时候抬举他们，用大能的手领他们出来；
{Act 13:18} And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.
{Act 13:18} 又在旷野容忍（或作：抚养）他们，约有四十年。
{Act 13:19} And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance.
{Act 13:19} 既灭了迦南地七族的人，就把那地分给他们为业；
{Act 13:20} All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
{Act 13:20} 此后给他们设立士师，约有四百五十年，直到先知撒母耳的时候。
{Act 13:21} Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
{Act 13:21} 后来他们求一个王，神就将便雅悯支派中基士的儿子扫罗，给他们作王四十年。
{Act 13:22} And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, 'I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'
{Act 13:22} 既废了扫罗，就选立大卫作他们的王，又为他作见证说：‘我寻得耶西的儿子大卫，他是合我心意的人，凡事要遵行我的旨意。’
{Act 13:23} Of this man's offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.
{Act 13:23} 从这人的后裔中，神已经照着所应许的，为以色列人立了一位救主，就是耶稣。
{Act 13:24} Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
{Act 13:24} 在他没有出来以先，约翰向以色列众民宣讲悔改的洗礼。
{Act 13:25} And as John was finishing his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
{Act 13:25} 约翰将行尽他的程途说：‘你们以为我是谁？我不是基督；只是有一位在我以后来的，我解他脚上的鞋带也是不配的。’
{Act 13:26} "Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.
{Act 13:26} 弟兄们，亚伯拉罕的子孙和你们中间敬畏神的人哪，这救世的道是传给我们的。
{Act 13:27} For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
{Act 13:27} 耶路撒冷居住的人和他们的官长，因为不认识基督，也不明白每安息日所读众先知的书，就把基督定了死罪，正应了先知的预言；
{Act 13:28} And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.
{Act 13:28} 虽然查不出他有当死的罪来，还是求彼拉多杀他；
{Act 13:29} And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.
{Act 13:29} 既成就了经上指着他所记的一切话，就把他从木头上取下来，放在坟墓里。
{Act 13:30} But God raised him from the dead,
{Act 13:30} 神却叫他从死里复活。
{Act 13:31} and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.
{Act 13:31} 那从加利利同他上耶路撒冷的人多日看见他，这些人如今在民间是他的见证。
{Act 13:32} And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,
{Act 13:32} 我们也报好信息给你们，就是那应许祖宗的话，
{Act 13:33} this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, "'You are my Son, today I have begotten you.'
{Act 13:33} 神已经向我们这作儿女的应验，叫耶稣复活了。正如诗篇第二篇上记着说：你是我的儿子，我今日生你。
{Act 13:34} And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way, "'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'
{Act 13:34} 论到神叫他从死里复活，不再归于朽坏，就这样说：我必将所应许大卫那圣洁、可靠的恩典赐给你们。
{Act 13:35} Therefore he says also in another psalm, "'You will not let your Holy One see corruption.'
{Act 13:35} 又有一篇上说：你必不叫你的圣者见朽坏。
{Act 13:36} For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption,
{Act 13:36} “大卫在世的时候遵行了神的旨意，就睡了（或作：大卫按神的旨意服事了他那一世的人，就睡了），归到他祖宗那里，已见朽坏；
{Act 13:37} but he whom God raised up did not see corruption.
{Act 13:37} 惟独神所复活的，他并未见朽坏。
{Act 13:38} Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,
{Act 13:38} 所以，弟兄们，你们当晓得：赦罪的道是由这人传给你们的。
{Act 13:39} and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.
{Act 13:39} 你们靠摩西的律法，在一切不得称义的事上信靠这人，就都得称义了。
{Act 13:40} Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:
{Act 13:40} 所以，你们务要小心，免得先知书上所说的临到你们。
{Act 13:41} "'Look, you scoffers, be astounded and perish; for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.'"
{Act 13:41} 主说：你们这轻慢的人要观看，要惊奇，要灭亡；因为在你们的时候，我行一件事，虽有人告诉你们，你们总是不信。
{Act 13:42} As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath.
{Act 13:42} 他们出会堂的时候，众人请他们到下安息日再讲这话给他们听。
{Act 13:43} And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.
{Act 13:43} 散会以后，犹太人和敬虔进犹太教的人多有跟从保罗、巴拿巴的。二人对他们讲道，劝他们务要恒久在神的恩中。
{Act 13:44} The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
{Act 13:44} 到下安息日，合城的人几乎都来聚集，要听神的道。
{Act 13:45} But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him.
{Act 13:45} 但犹太人看见人这样多，就满心嫉妒，硬驳保罗所说的话，并且毁谤。
{Act 13:46} And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, "It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.
{Act 13:46} 保罗和巴拿巴放胆说：“神的道先讲给你们原是应当的；只因你们弃绝这道，断定自己不配得永生，我们就转向外邦人去。
{Act 13:47} For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, "'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"
{Act 13:47} 因为主曾这样吩咐我们说：我已经立你作外邦人的光，叫你施行救恩，直到地极。”
{Act 13:48} And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
{Act 13:48} 外邦人听见这话，就欢喜了，赞美神的道；凡预定得永生的人都信了。
{Act 13:49} And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region.
{Act 13:49} 于是主的道传遍了那一带地方。
{Act 13:50} But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.
{Act 13:50} 但犹太人挑唆虔敬、尊贵的妇女和城内有名望的人，逼迫保罗、巴拿巴，将他们赶出境外。
{Act 13:51} But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium.
{Act 13:51} 二人对着众人跺下脚上的尘土，就往以哥念去了。
{Act 13:52} And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
{Act 13:52} 门徒满心喜乐，又被圣灵充满。
{Act 14:1}  Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
{Act 14:1}  二人在以哥念同进犹太人的会堂，在那里讲的，叫犹太人和希利尼人信的很多。
{Act 14:2}  But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
{Act 14:2}  但那不顺从的犹太人耸动外邦人，叫他们心里恼恨弟兄。
{Act 14:3}  So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
{Act 14:3}  二人在那里住了多日，倚靠主放胆讲道；主藉他们的手施行神迹奇事，证明他的恩道。
{Act 14:4}  But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles.
{Act 14:4}  城里的众人就分了党，有附从犹太人的，有附从使徒的。
{Act 14:5}  When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them,
{Act 14:5}  那时，外邦人和犹太人，并他们的官长，一齐拥上来，要凌辱使徒，用石头打他们。
{Act 14:6}  they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country,
{Act 14:6}  使徒知道了，就逃往吕高尼的路司得、特庇两个城和周围地方去，
{Act 14:7}  and there they continued to preach the gospel.
{Act 14:7}  在那里传福音。
{Act 14:8}  Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet. He was crippled from birth and had never walked.
{Act 14:8}  路司得城里坐着一个两脚无力的人，生来是瘸腿的，从来没有走过。
{Act 14:9}  He listened to Paul speaking. And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,
{Act 14:9}  他听保罗讲道，保罗定睛看他，见他有信心，可得痊愈，
{Act 14:10} said in a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And he sprang up and began walking.
{Act 14:10} 就大声说：“你起来，两脚站直！”那人就跳起来，而且行走。
{Act 14:11} And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"
{Act 14:11} 众人看见保罗所做的事，就用吕高尼的话大声说：“有神藉着人形降临在我们中间了。”
{Act 14:12} Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
{Act 14:12} 于是称巴拿巴为丢斯，称保罗为希耳米，因为他说话领首。
{Act 14:13} And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.
{Act 14:13} 有城外丢斯庙的祭司牵着牛，拿着花圈，来到门前，要同众人向使徒献祭。
{Act 14:14} But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out,
{Act 14:14} 巴拿巴、保罗二使徒听见，就撕开衣裳，跳进众人中间，喊着说：
{Act 14:15} "Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.
{Act 14:15} “诸君，为什么做这事呢？我们也是人，性情和你们一样。我们传福音给你们，是叫你们离弃这些虚妄，归向那创造天、地、海、和其中万物的永生神。
{Act 14:16} In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.
{Act 14:16} 他在从前的世代，任凭万国各行其道；
{Act 14:17} Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness."
{Act 14:17} 然而为自己未尝不显出证据来，就如常施恩惠，从天降雨，赏赐丰年，叫你们饮食饱足，满心喜乐。”
{Act 14:18} Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.
{Act 14:18} 二人说了这些话，仅仅的拦住众人不献祭与他们。
{Act 14:19} But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
{Act 14:19} 但有些犹太人从安提阿和以哥念来，挑唆众人，就用石头打保罗，以为他是死了，便拖到城外。
{Act 14:20} But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.
{Act 14:20} 门徒正围着他，他就起来，走进城去。第二天，同巴拿巴往特庇去，
{Act 14:21} When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
{Act 14:21} 对那城里的人传了福音，使好些人作门徒，就回路司得、以哥念、安提阿去，
{Act 14:22} strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.
{Act 14:22} 坚固门徒的心，劝他们恒守所信的道；又说：“我们进入神的国，必须经历许多艰难。”
{Act 14:23} And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
{Act 14:23} 二人在各教会中选立了长老，又禁食祷告，就把他们交托所信的主。
{Act 14:24} Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
{Act 14:24} 二人经过彼西底，来到旁非利亚。
{Act 14:25} And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia,
{Act 14:25} 在别加讲了道，就下亚大利去，
{Act 14:26} and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled.
{Act 14:26} 从那里坐船，往安提阿去。当初，他们被众人所托、蒙神之恩，要办现在所做之工，就是在这地方。
{Act 14:27} And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
{Act 14:27} 到了那里，聚集了会众，就述说神藉他们所行的一切事，并神怎样为外邦人开了信道的门。
{Act 14:28} And they remained no little time with the disciples.
{Act 14:28} 二人就在那里同门徒住了多日。
{Act 15:1}  But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
{Act 15:1}  有几个人从犹太下来，教训弟兄们说：“你们若不按摩西的规条受割礼，不能得救。”
{Act 15:2}  And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question.
{Act 15:2}  保罗、巴拿巴与他们大大的分争辩论；众门徒就定规，叫保罗、巴拿巴和本会中几个人，为所辩论的，上耶路撒冷去见使徒和长老。
{Act 15:3}  So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers.
{Act 15:3}  于是教会送他们起行。他们经过腓尼基、撒玛利亚，随处传说外邦人归主的事，叫众弟兄都甚欢喜。
{Act 15:4}  When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them.
{Act 15:4}  到了耶路撒冷，教会和使徒并长老都接待他们，他们就述说神同他们所行的一切事。
{Act 15:5}  But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses."
{Act 15:5}  惟有几个信徒、是法利赛教门的人，起来说：“必须给外邦人行割礼，吩咐他们遵守摩西的律法。”
{Act 15:6}  The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.
{Act 15:6}  使徒和长老聚会商议这事；
{Act 15:7}  And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.
{Act 15:7}  辩论已经多了，彼得就起来，说：“诸位弟兄，你们知道神早已在你们中间拣选了我，叫外邦人从我口中得听福音之道，而且相信。
{Act 15:8}  And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us,
{Act 15:8}  知道人心的神也为他们作了见证，赐圣灵给他们，正如给我们一样；
{Act 15:9}  and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith.
{Act 15:9}  又藉着信洁净了他们的心，并不分他们我们。
{Act 15:10} Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?
{Act 15:10} 现在为什么试探神，要把我们祖宗和我们所不能负的轭放在门徒的颈项上呢？
{Act 15:11} But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will."
{Act 15:11} 我们得救乃是因主耶稣的恩，和他们一样，这是我们所信的。”
{Act 15:12} And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
{Act 15:12} 众人都默默无声，听巴拿巴和保罗述说神藉他们在外邦人中所行的神迹奇事。
{Act 15:13} After they finished speaking, James replied, "Brothers, listen to me.
{Act 15:13} 他们住了声，雅各就说：“诸位弟兄，请听我的话。
{Act 15:14} Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name.
{Act 15:14} 方才西门述说神当初怎样眷顾外邦人，从他们中间选取百姓归于自己的名下；
{Act 15:15} And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,
{Act 15:15} 众先知的话也与这意思相合。
{Act 15:16} "'After this I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins,}    and I will restore it,
{Act 15:16} 正如经上所写的：此后，我要回来，重新修造大卫倒塌的帐幕，把那破坏的重新修造建立起来，
{Act 15:17} that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name,} says the Lord, who makes these things
{Act 15:17} 叫余剩的人，就是凡称为我名下的外邦人，都寻求主。
{Act 15:18} known from of old.'
{Act 15:18} 这话是从创世以来，显明这事的主说的。
{Act 15:19} Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God,
{Act 15:19} “所以据我的意见，不可难为那归服神的外邦人；
{Act 15:20} but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.
{Act 15:20} 只要写信，吩咐他们禁戒偶像的污秽和奸淫，并勒死的牲畜和血。
{Act 15:21} For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues."
{Act 15:21} 因为从古以来，摩西的书在各城有人传讲，每逢安息日，在会堂里诵读。”
{Act 15:22} Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,
{Act 15:22} 那时，使徒和长老并全教会定意从他们中间拣选人，差他们和保罗、巴拿巴同往安提阿去；所拣选的就是称呼巴撒巴的犹大和西拉。这两个人在弟兄中是作首领的。
{Act 15:23} with the following letter: "The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings.
{Act 15:23} 于是写信交付他们，内中说：“使徒和作长老的弟兄们问安提阿、叙利亚、基利家外邦众弟兄的安。
{Act 15:24} Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,
{Act 15:24} 我们听说，有几个人从我们这里出去，用言语搅扰你们，惑乱你们的心。（有古卷加：你们必须受割礼，守摩西的律法。）其实我们并没有吩咐他们。
{Act 15:25} it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
{Act 15:25} 所以，我们同心定意，拣选几个人，差他们同我们所亲爱的巴拿巴和保罗往你们那里去。
{Act 15:26} men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{Act 15:26} 这二人是为我主耶稣基督的名不顾性命的。
{Act 15:27} We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.
{Act 15:27} 我们就差了犹大和西拉，他们也要亲口诉说这些事。
{Act 15:28} For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements:
{Act 15:28} 因为圣灵和我们定意不将别的重担放在你们身上；惟有几件事是不可少的，
{Act 15:29} that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell."
{Act 15:29} 就是禁戒祭偶像的物和血，并勒死的牲畜和奸淫。这几件你们若能自己禁戒不犯就好了。愿你们平安！”
{Act 15:30} So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.
{Act 15:30} 他们既奉了差遣，就下安提阿去，聚集众人，交付书信。
{Act 15:31} And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.
{Act 15:31} 众人念了，因为信上安慰的话就欢喜了。
{Act 15:32} And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words.
{Act 15:32} 犹大和西拉也是先知，就用许多话劝勉弟兄，坚固他们。
{Act 15:33} And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.
{Act 15:33} 住了些日子，弟兄们打发他们平平安安的回到差遣他们的人那里去。（有古卷加：）
{Act 15:34} But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.
{Act 15:34} （惟有西拉定意仍住在那里。）
{Act 15:35} But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
{Act 15:35} 但保罗和巴拿巴仍住在安提阿，和许多别人一同教训人，传主的道。
{Act 15:36} And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are."
{Act 15:36} 过了些日子，保罗对巴拿巴说：“我们可以回到从前宣传主道的各城，看望弟兄们景况如何。”
{Act 15:37} Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark.
{Act 15:37} 巴拿巴有意要带称呼马可的约翰同去；
{Act 15:38} But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
{Act 15:38} 但保罗因为马可从前在旁非利亚离开他们，不和他们同去做工，就以为不可带他去。
{Act 15:39} And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,
{Act 15:39} 于是二人起了争论，甚至彼此分开。巴拿巴带着马可，坐船往居比路去；
{Act 15:40} but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.
{Act 15:40} 保罗拣选了西拉，也出去，蒙弟兄们把他交于主的恩中。
{Act 15:41} And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
{Act 15:41} 他就走遍叙利亚、基利家，坚固众教会。
{Act 16:1}  Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek.
{Act 16:1}  保罗来到特庇，又到路司得。在那里有一个门徒，名叫提摩太，是信主之犹太妇人的儿子，他父亲却是希利尼人。
{Act 16:2}  He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium.
{Act 16:2}  路司得和以哥念的弟兄都称赞他。
{Act 16:3}  Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
{Act 16:3}  保罗要带他同去，只因那些地方的犹太人都知道他父亲是希利尼人，就给他行了割礼。
{Act 16:4}  As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.
{Act 16:4}  他们经过各城，把耶路撒冷使徒和长老所定的条规交给门徒遵守。
{Act 16:5}  So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.
{Act 16:5}  于是众教会信心越发坚固，人数天天加增。
{Act 16:6}  And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
{Act 16:6}  圣灵既然禁止他们在亚西亚讲道，他们就经过弗吕家、加拉太一带地方。
{Act 16:7}  And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.
{Act 16:7}  到了每西亚的边界，他们想要往庇推尼去，耶稣的灵却不许。
{Act 16:8}  So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.
{Act 16:8}  他们就越过每西亚，下到特罗亚去。
{Act 16:9}  And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
{Act 16:9}  在夜间有异象现与保罗。有一个马其顿人站着求他说：“请你过到马其顿来帮助我们。”
{Act 16:10} And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
{Act 16:10} 保罗既看见这异象，我们随即想要往马其顿去，以为神召我们传福音给那里的人听。
{Act 16:11} So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis,
{Act 16:11} 于是从特罗亚开船，一直行到撒摩特喇，第二天到了尼亚波利。
{Act 16:12} and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days.
{Act 16:12} 从那里来到腓立比，就是马其顿这一方的头一个城，也是罗马的驻防城。我们在这城里住了几天。
{Act 16:13} And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
{Act 16:13} 当安息日，我们出城门，到了河边，知道那里有一个祷告的地方，我们就坐下对那聚会的妇女讲道。
{Act 16:14} One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.
{Act 16:14} 有一个卖紫色布疋的妇人，名叫吕底亚，是推雅推喇城的人，素来敬拜神。他听见了，主就开导他的心，叫他留心听保罗所讲的话。
{Act 16:15} And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay." And she prevailed upon us.
{Act 16:15} 他和他一家既领了洗，便求我们说：“你们若以为我是真信主的（或作：你们若以为我是忠心事主的），请到我家里来住。于是强留我们。
{Act 16:16} As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling.
{Act 16:16} 后来，我们往那祷告的地方去。有一个使女迎着面来，他被巫鬼所附，用法术，叫他主人们大得财利。
{Act 16:17} She followed Paul and us, crying out, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation."
{Act 16:17} 他跟随保罗和我们，喊着说：“这些人是至高神的仆人，对你们传说救人的道。”
{Act 16:18} And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out that very hour.
{Act 16:18} 他一连多日这样喊叫，保罗就心中厌烦，转身对那鬼说：“我奉耶稣基督的名，吩咐你从他身上出来！”那鬼当时就出来了。
{Act 16:19} But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
{Act 16:19} 使女的主人们见得利的指望没有了，便揪住保罗和西拉，拉他们到市上去见首领；
{Act 16:20} And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city.
{Act 16:20} 又带到官长面前说：“这些人原是犹太人，竟骚扰我们的城，
{Act 16:21} They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice."
{Act 16:21} 传我们罗马人所不可受不可行的规矩。”
{Act 16:22} The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods.
{Act 16:22} 众人就一同起来攻击他们。官长吩咐剥了他们的衣裳，用棍打；
{Act 16:23} And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely.
{Act 16:23} 打了许多棍，便将他们下在监里，嘱咐禁卒严紧看守。
{Act 16:24} Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
{Act 16:24} 禁卒领了这样的命，就把他们下在内监里，两脚上了木狗。
{Act 16:25} About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,
{Act 16:25} 约在半夜，保罗和西拉祷告，唱诗赞美神，众囚犯也侧耳而听。
{Act 16:26} and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were unfastened.
{Act 16:26} 忽然，地大震动，甚至监牢的地基都摇动了，监门立刻全开，众囚犯的锁链也都松开了。
{Act 16:27} When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
{Act 16:27} 禁卒一醒，看见监门全开，以为囚犯已经逃走，就拔刀要自杀。
{Act 16:28} But Paul cried with a loud voice, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here."
{Act 16:28} 保罗大声呼叫说：“不要伤害自己！我们都在这里。”
{Act 16:29} And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas.
{Act 16:29} 禁卒叫人拿灯来，就跳进去，战战兢兢的俯伏在保罗、西拉面前；
{Act 16:30} Then he brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
{Act 16:30} 又领他们出来，说：“二位先生，我当怎样行才可以得救？”
{Act 16:31} And they said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household."
{Act 16:31} 他们说：“当信主耶稣，你和你一家都必得救。”
{Act 16:32} And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
{Act 16:32} 他们就把主的道讲给他和他全家的人听。
{Act 16:33} And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family.
{Act 16:33} 当夜，就在那时候，禁卒把他们带去，洗他们的伤；他和属乎他的人立时都受了洗。
{Act 16:34} Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.
{Act 16:34} 于是禁卒领他们上自己家里去，给他们摆上饭。他和全家，因为信了神，都很喜乐。
{Act 16:35} But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, "Let those men go."
{Act 16:35} 到了天亮，官长打发差役来，说：“释放那两个人吧。”
{Act 16:36} And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace."
{Act 16:36} 禁卒就把这话告诉保罗说：“官长打发人来叫释放你们，如今可以出监，平平安安的去吧。”
{Act 16:37} But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out."
{Act 16:37} 保罗却说：“我们是罗马人，并没有定罪，他们就在众人面前打了我们，又把我们下在监里，现在要私下撵我们出去吗？这是不行的。叫他们自己来领我们出去吧？”
{Act 16:38} The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.
{Act 16:38} 差役把这话回禀官长。官长听见他们是罗马人，就害怕了，
{Act 16:39} So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city.
{Act 16:39} 于是来劝他们，领他们出来，请他们离开那城。
{Act 16:40} So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.
{Act 16:40} 二人出了监，往吕底亚家里去；见了弟兄们，劝慰他们一番，就走了。
{Act 17:1}  Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
{Act 17:1}  保罗和西拉经过暗妃波里、亚波罗尼亚，来到帖撒罗尼迦，在那里有犹太人的会堂。
{Act 17:2}  And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
{Act 17:2}  保罗照他素常的规矩进去，一连三个安息日，本着圣经与他们辩论，
{Act 17:3}  explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ."
{Act 17:3}  讲解陈明基督必须受害，从死里复活；又说：“我所传与你们的这位耶稣就是基督。”
{Act 17:4}  And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women.
{Act 17:4}  他们中间有些人听了劝，就附从保罗和西拉，并有许多虔敬的希利尼人，尊贵的妇女也不少。
{Act 17:5}  But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd.
{Act 17:5}  但那不信的犹太人心里嫉妒，招聚了些市井匪类，搭夥成群，耸动合城的人闯进耶孙的家，要将保罗、西拉带到百姓那里。
{Act 17:6}  And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, "These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also,
{Act 17:6}  找不着他们，就把耶孙和几个弟兄拉到地方官那里，喊叫说：“那搅乱天下的也到这里来了，
{Act 17:7}  and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus."
{Act 17:7}  耶孙收留他们。这些人都违背该撒的命令，说另有一个王耶稣。”
{Act 17:8}  And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things.
{Act 17:8}  众人和地方官听见这话，就惊慌了；
{Act 17:9}  And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
{Act 17:9}  于是取了耶孙和其余之人的保状，就释放了他们。
{Act 17:10} The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue.
{Act 17:10} 弟兄们随即在夜间打发保罗和西拉往庇哩亚去。二人到了，就进入犹太人的会堂。
{Act 17:11} Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.
{Act 17:11} 这地方的人贤于帖撒罗尼迦的人，甘心领受这道，天天考查圣经，要晓得这道是与不是。
{Act 17:12} Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men.
{Act 17:12} 所以他们中间多有相信的，又有希利尼尊贵的妇女，男子也不少。
{Act 17:13} But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds.
{Act 17:13} 但帖撒罗尼迦的犹太人知道保罗又在庇哩亚传神的道，也就往那里去，耸动搅扰众人。
{Act 17:14} Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there.
{Act 17:14} 当时弟兄们便打发保罗往海边去，西拉和提摩太仍住在庇哩亚。
{Act 17:15} Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
{Act 17:15} 送保罗的人带他到了雅典，既领了保罗的命，叫西拉和提摩太速速到他这里来，就回去了。
{Act 17:16} Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols.
{Act 17:16} 保罗在雅典等候他们的时候，看见满城都是偶像，就心里着急；
{Act 17:17} So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
{Act 17:17} 于是在会堂里与犹太人和虔敬的人，并每日在市上所遇见的人，辩论。
{Act 17:18} Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, "What does this babbler wish to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities"--because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.
{Act 17:18} 还有以彼古罗和斯多亚两门的学士，与他争论。有的说：“这胡言乱语的要说什么？”有的说：“他似乎是传说外邦鬼神的。”这话是因保罗传讲耶稣与复活的道。
{Act 17:19} And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
{Act 17:19} 他们就把他带到亚略巴古，说：“你所讲的这新道，我们也可以知道吗？”
{Act 17:20} For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean."
{Act 17:20} 因为你有些奇怪的事传到我们耳中，我们愿意知道这些事是什么意思。”
{Act 17:21} Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.
{Act 17:21} （雅典人和住在那里的客人都不顾别的事，只将新闻说说听听。）
{Act 17:22} So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: "Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.
{Act 17:22} 保罗站在亚略巴古当中，说：“众位雅典人哪，我看你们凡事很敬畏鬼神。
{Act 17:23} For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, 'To the unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.
{Act 17:23} 我游行的时候，观看你们所敬拜的，遇见一座坛，上面写着‘未识之神’。你们所不认识而敬拜的，我现在告诉你们。
{Act 17:24} The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man,
{Act 17:24} 创造宇宙和其中万物的神，既是天地的主，就不住人手所造的殿，
{Act 17:25} nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.
{Act 17:25} 也不用人手服事，好像缺少什么；自己倒将生命、气息、万物，赐给万人。
{Act 17:26} And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place,
{Act 17:26} 他从一本（本：有古卷是血脉）造出万族的人，住在全地上，并且预先定准他们的年限和所住的疆界，
{Act 17:27} that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,
{Act 17:27} 要叫他们寻求神，或者可以揣摩而得，其实他离我们各人不远；
{Act 17:28} for "'In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your own poets have said, "'For we are indeed his offspring.'
{Act 17:28} 我们生活、动作、存留，都在乎他。就如你们作诗的，有人说：‘我们也是他所生的。’
{Act 17:29} Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.
{Act 17:29} 我们既是神所生的，就不当以为神的神性像人用手艺、心思所雕刻的金、银、石。
{Act 17:30} The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,
{Act 17:30} 世人蒙昧无知的时候，神并不监察，如今却吩咐各处的人都要悔改。
{Act 17:31} because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead."
{Act 17:31} 因为他已经定了日子，要藉着他所设立的人按公义审判天下，并且叫他从死里复活，给万人作可信的凭据。”
{Act 17:32} Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, "We will hear you again about this."
{Act 17:32} 众人听见从死里复活的话，就有讥诮他的；又有人说：“我们再听你讲这个吧！”
{Act 17:33} So Paul went out from their midst.
{Act 17:33} 于是保罗从他们当中出去了。
{Act 17:34} But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
{Act 17:34} 但有几个人贴近他，信了主，其中有亚略巴古的官丢尼修，并一个妇人，名叫大马哩，还有别人一同信从。
{Act 18:1}  After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
{Act 18:1}  这事以后，保罗离了雅典，来到哥林多。
{Act 18:2}  And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them,
{Act 18:2}  遇见一个犹太人，名叫亚居拉，他生在本都；因为革老丢犹太人都离开罗马，新近带着妻百基拉，从义大利来。保罗就投奔了他们。
{Act 18:3}  and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade.
{Act 18:3}  他们本是制造帐棚为业。保罗因与他们同业，就和他们同住做工。
{Act 18:4}  And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and tried to persuade Jews and Greeks.
{Act 18:4}  每逢安息日，保罗在会堂里辩论，劝化犹太人和希利尼人。
{Act 18:5}  When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus.
{Act 18:5}  西拉和提摩太从马其顿来的时候，保罗为道迫切，向犹太人证明耶稣是基督。
{Act 18:6}  And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
{Act 18:6}  他们既抗拒、毁谤，保罗就抖着衣裳，说：“你们的罪（原文作血）归到你们自己头上，与我无干（原文作我却干净）。从今以后，我要往外邦人那里去。”
{Act 18:7}  And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. His house was next door to the synagogue.
{Act 18:7}  于是离开那里，到了一个人的家中；这人名叫提多犹士都，是敬拜神的，他的家靠近会堂。
{Act 18:8}  Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire household. And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized.
{Act 18:8}  管会堂的基利司布和全家都信了主，还有许多哥林多人听了，就相信受洗。
{Act 18:9}  And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, "Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent,
{Act 18:9}  夜间，主在异象中对保罗说：“不要怕，只管讲，不要闭口，
{Act 18:10} for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people."
{Act 18:10} 有我与你同在，必没有人下手害你，因为在这城里我有许多的百姓。”
{Act 18:11} And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
{Act 18:11} 保罗在那里住了一年零六个月，将神的道教训他们。
{Act 18:12} But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal,
{Act 18:12} 到迦流作亚该亚方伯的时候，犹太人同心起来攻击保罗，拉他到公堂，
{Act 18:13} saying, "This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law."
{Act 18:13} 说：“这个人劝人不按着律法敬拜神。”
{Act 18:14} But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to accept your complaint.
{Act 18:14} 保罗刚要开口，迦流就对犹太人说：“你们这些犹太人！如果是为冤枉或奸恶的事，我理当耐性听你们。
{Act 18:15} But since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these things."
{Act 18:15} 但所争论的，若是关乎言语、名目，和你们的律法，你们自己去办吧！这样的事我不愿意审问”；
{Act 18:16} And he drove them from the tribunal.
{Act 18:16} 就把他们撵出公堂。
{Act 18:17} And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.
{Act 18:17} 众人便揪住管会堂的所提尼，在堂前打他。这些事迦流都不管。
{Act 18:18} After this, Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of the brothers and set sail for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had cut his hair, for he was under a vow.
{Act 18:18} 保罗又住了多日，就辞别了弟兄，坐船往叙利亚去；百基拉、亚居拉和他同去。他因为许过愿，就在坚革哩剪了头发。
{Act 18:19} And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
{Act 18:19} 到了以弗所，保罗就把他们留在那里，自己进了会堂，和犹太人辩论。
{Act 18:20} When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined.
{Act 18:20} 众人请他多住些日子，他却不允，
{Act 18:21} But on taking leave of them he said, "I will return to you if God wills," and he set sail from Ephesus.
{Act 18:21} 就辞别他们，说：“神若许我，我还要回到你们这里”；于是开船离了以弗所。
{Act 18:22} When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.
{Act 18:22} 在该撒利亚下了船，就上耶路撒冷去问教会安，随后下安提阿去。
{Act 18:23} After spending some time there, he departed and went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
{Act 18:23} 住了些日子，又离开那里，挨次经过加拉太和弗吕家地方，坚固众门徒。
{Act 18:24} Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures.
{Act 18:24} 有一个犹太人，名叫亚波罗，来到以弗所。他生在亚力山大，是有学问（或作：口才）的，最能讲解圣经。
{Act 18:25} He had been instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.
{Act 18:25} 这人已经在主的道上受了教训，心里火热，将耶稣的事详细讲论教训人；只是他单晓得约翰的洗礼。
{Act 18:26} He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
{Act 18:26} 他在会堂里放胆讲道；百基拉，亚居拉听见，就接他来，将神的道给他讲解更加详细。
{Act 18:27} And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed,
{Act 18:27} 他想要往亚该亚去，弟兄们就勉励他，并写信请门徒接待他（或作：弟兄们就写信劝门徒接待他）。他到了那里，多帮助那蒙恩信主的人，
{Act 18:28} for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.
{Act 18:28} 在众人面前极有能力、驳倒犹太人，引圣经证明耶稣是基督。
{Act 19:1}  And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.
{Act 19:1}  亚波罗在哥林多的时候，保罗经过了上边一带地方，就来到以弗所；在那里遇见几个门徒，
{Act 19:2}  And he said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" And they said, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
{Act 19:2}  问他们说：“你们信的时候受了圣灵没有？”他们回答说：“没有，也未曾听见有圣灵赐下来。”
{Act 19:3}  And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into John's baptism."
{Act 19:3}  保罗说：“这样，你们受的是什么洗呢？”他们说：“是约翰的洗。”
{Act 19:4}  And Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus."
{Act 19:4}  保罗说：“约翰所行的是悔改的洗，告诉百姓当信那在他以后要来的，就是耶稣。”
{Act 19:5}  On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
{Act 19:5}  他们听见这话，就奉主耶稣的名受洗。
{Act 19:6}  And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying.
{Act 19:6}  保罗按手在他们头上，圣灵便降在他们身上，他们就说方言，又说预言（或作：又讲道）
{Act 19:7}  There were about twelve men in all.
{Act 19:7}  一共约有十二个人。
{Act 19:8}  And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.
{Act 19:8}  保罗进会堂，放胆讲道，一连三个月，辩论神国的事，劝化众人。
{Act 19:9}  But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus.
{Act 19:9}  后来，有些人心里刚硬不信，在众人面前毁谤这道，保罗就离开他们，也叫门徒与他们分离，便在推喇奴的学房天天辩论。
{Act 19:10} This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
{Act 19:10} 这样有两年之久，叫一切住在亚西亚的，无论是犹太人，是希利尼人，都听见主的道。
{Act 19:11} And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,
{Act 19:11} 神藉保罗的手行了些非常的奇事；
{Act 19:12} so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.
{Act 19:12} 甚至有人从保罗身上拿手巾或围裙放在病人身上，病就退了，恶鬼也出去了。
{Act 19:13} Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims."
{Act 19:13} 那时，有几个游行各处、念咒赶鬼的犹太人，向那被恶鬼附的人擅自称主耶稣的名，说：“我奉保罗所传的耶稣敕令你们出来！”
{Act 19:14} Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.
{Act 19:14} 做这事的，有犹太祭司长士基瓦的七个儿子。
{Act 19:15} But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?"
{Act 19:15} 恶鬼回答他们说：“耶稣我认识，保罗我也知道。你们却是谁呢？”
{Act 19:16} And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
{Act 19:16} 恶鬼所附的人就跳在他们身上，胜了其中二人，制伏他们，叫他们赤着身子受了伤，从那房子里逃出去了。
{Act 19:17} And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled.
{Act 19:17} 凡住在以弗所的，无论是犹太人，是希利尼人，都知道这事，也都惧怕；主耶稣的名从此就尊大了。
{Act 19:18} Also many of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices.
{Act 19:18} 那已经信的，多有人来承认诉说自己所行的事。
{Act 19:19} And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.
{Act 19:19} 平素行邪术的，也有许多人把书拿来，堆积在众人面前焚烧。他们算计书价，便知道共合五万块钱。
{Act 19:20} So the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily.
{Act 19:20} 主的道大大兴旺，而且得胜，就是这样。
{Act 19:21} Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
{Act 19:21} 这些事完了，保罗心里定意经过了马其顿、亚该亚，就往耶路撒冷去；又说：“我到了那里以后，也必须往罗马去看看。”
{Act 19:22} And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
{Act 19:22} 于是从帮助他的人中打发提摩太、以拉都二人往马其顿去，自己暂时等在亚西亚。
{Act 19:23} About that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way.
{Act 19:23} 那时，因为这道起的扰乱不小。
{Act 19:24} For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen.
{Act 19:24} 有一个银匠，名叫底米丢，是制造亚底米神银龛的，他使这样手艺人生意发达。
{Act 19:25} These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, "Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth.
{Act 19:25} 他聚集他们和同行的工人，说：“众位，你们知道我们是倚靠这生意发财。
{Act 19:26} And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods.
{Act 19:26} 这保罗不但在以弗所，也几乎在亚西亚全地，引诱迷惑许多人，说：‘人手所做的，不是神。’这是你们所看见所听见的。
{Act 19:27} And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship."
{Act 19:27} 这样，不独我们这事业被人藐视，就是大女神亚底米的庙也要被人轻忽，连亚西亚全地和普天下所敬拜的大女神之威荣也要消灭了。”
{Act 19:28} When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
{Act 19:28} 众人听见，就怒气填胸，喊着说：“大哉，以弗所人的亚底米啊！”
{Act 19:29} So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's companions in travel.
{Act 19:29} 满城都轰动起来。众人拿住与保罗同行的马其顿人该犹和亚里达古，齐心拥进戏园里去。
{Act 19:30} But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him.
{Act 19:30} 保罗想要进去，到百姓那里，门徒却不许他去。
{Act 19:31} And even some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater.
{Act 19:31} 还有亚西亚几位首领，是保罗的朋友，打发人来劝他，不要冒险到戏园里去。
{Act 19:32} Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.
{Act 19:32} 聚集的人纷纷乱乱，有喊叫这个的，有喊叫那个的，大半不知道是为什么聚集。
{Act 19:33} Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd.
{Act 19:33} 有人把亚力山大从众人中带出来，犹太人推他往前，亚力山大就摆手，要向百姓分诉；
{Act 19:34} But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
{Act 19:34} 只因他们认出他是犹太人，就大家同声喊着说：“大哉！以弗所人的亚底米啊。”如此约有两小时。
{Act 19:35} And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, "Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky?
{Act 19:35} 那城里的书记安抚了众人，就说：“以弗所人哪，谁不知道以弗所人的城是看守大亚底米的庙和从丢斯那里落下来的像呢？
{Act 19:36} Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.
{Act 19:36} 这事既是驳不倒的，你们就当安静，不可造次。
{Act 19:37} For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess.
{Act 19:37} 你们把这些人带来，他们并没有偷窃庙中之物，也没有谤渎我们的女神。
{Act 19:38} If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.
{Act 19:38} 若是底米丢和他同行的人有控告人的事，自有放告的日子（或作：自有公堂），也有方伯可以彼此对告。
{Act 19:39} But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.
{Act 19:39} 你们若问别的事，就可以照常例聚集断定。
{Act 19:40} For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion."
{Act 19:40} 今日的扰乱本是无缘无故，我们难免被查问。论到这样聚众，我们也说不出所以然来。”
{Act 19:41} And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
{Act 19:41} 说了这话，便叫众人散去。
{Act 20:1}  After the uproar ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and after encouraging them, he said farewell and departed for Macedonia.
{Act 20:1}  乱定之后，保罗请门徒来，劝勉他们，就辞别起行，往马其顿去。
{Act 20:2}  When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece.
{Act 20:2}  走遍了那一带地方，用许多话劝勉门徒。（或作：众人），然后来到希利尼。
{Act 20:3}  There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.
{Act 20:3}  在那里住了三个月，将要坐船往叙利亚去，犹太人设计要害他，他就定意从马其顿回去。
{Act 20:4}  Sopater the Berean, son of Pyrrhus, accompanied him; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.
{Act 20:4}  同他到亚西亚去的，有庇哩亚人毕罗斯的儿子所巴特，帖撒罗尼迦人亚里达古和西公都，还有特庇人该犹，并提摩太，又有亚西亚人推基古和特罗非摩。
{Act 20:5}  These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas,
{Act 20:5}  这些人先走，在特罗亚等候我们。
{Act 20:6}  but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we came to them at Troas, where we stayed for seven days.
{Act 20:6}  过了除酵的日子，我们从腓立比开船，五天到了特罗亚，和他们相会，在那里住了七天。
{Act 20:7}  On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight.
{Act 20:7}  七日的第一日，我们聚会擘饼的时候，保罗因为要次日起行，就与他们讲论，直讲到半夜。
{Act 20:8}  There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered.
{Act 20:8}  我们聚会的那座楼上，有好些灯烛。
{Act 20:9}  And a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer. And being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.
{Act 20:9}  有一个少年人，名叫犹推古，坐在窗台上，困倦沉睡。保罗讲了多时，少年人睡熟了，就从三层楼上掉下去；扶起他来，已经死了。
{Act 20:10} But Paul went down and bent over him, and taking him in his arms, said, "Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him."
{Act 20:10} 保罗下去，伏在他身上，抱着他，说：“你们不要发慌，他的灵魂还在身上。”
{Act 20:11} And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed.
{Act 20:11} 保罗又上去，擘饼，吃了，谈论许久，直到天亮，这才走了。
{Act 20:12} And they took the youth away alive, and were not a little comforted.
{Act 20:12} 有人把那童子活活的领来，得的安慰不少。
{Act 20:13} But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land.
{Act 20:13} 我们先上船，开往亚朔去，意思要在那里接保罗；因为他是这样安排的，他自己打算要步行。
{Act 20:14} And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.
{Act 20:14} 他既在亚朔与我们相会，我们就接他上船，来到米推利尼。
{Act 20:15} And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we went to Miletus.
{Act 20:15} 从那里开船，次日到了基阿的对面；又次日，在撒摩靠岸；又次日，来到米利都。
{Act 20:16} For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.
{Act 20:16} 乃因保罗早已定意越过以弗所，免得在亚西亚耽延，他急忙前走，巴不得赶五旬节能到耶路撒冷。
{Act 20:17} Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him.
{Act 20:17} 保罗从米利都打发人往以弗所去，请教会的长老来。
{Act 20:18} And when they came to him, he said to them: "You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia,
{Act 20:18} 他们来了，保罗就说：“你们知道，自从我到亚西亚的日子以来，在你们中间始终为人如何，
{Act 20:19} serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews;
{Act 20:19} 服事主，凡事谦卑，眼中流泪，又因犹太人的谋害，经历试炼。
{Act 20:20} how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house,
{Act 20:20} 你们也知道，凡与你们有益的，我没有一样避讳不说的，或在众人面前，或在各人家里，我都教导你们；
{Act 20:21} testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
{Act 20:21} 又对犹太人和希利尼人证明当向神悔改，信靠我主耶稣基督。
{Act 20:22} And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,
{Act 20:22} 现在我往耶路撒冷去，心甚迫切（原文作心被捆绑），不知道在那里要遇见什么事；
{Act 20:23} except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.
{Act 20:23} 但知道圣灵在各城里向我指证，说有捆锁与患难等待我。
{Act 20:24} But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.
{Act 20:24} 我却不以性命为念，也不看为宝贵，只要行完我的路程，成就我从主耶稣所领受的职事，证明神恩惠的福音。
{Act 20:25} And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again.
{Act 20:25} “我素常在你们中间来往，传讲神国的道；如今我晓得，你们以后都不得再见我的面了。
{Act 20:26} Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all,
{Act 20:26} 所以我今日向你们证明，你们中间无论何人死亡，罪不在我身上（原文作我于众人的血是洁净的）。
{Act 20:27} for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.
{Act 20:27} 因为神的旨意，我并没有一样避讳不传给你们的。
{Act 20:28} Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood.
{Act 20:28} 圣灵立你们作全群的监督，你们就当为自己谨慎，也为全群谨慎，牧养神的教会，就是他用自己血所买来的（或作：救赎的）。
{Act 20:29} I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;
{Act 20:29} 我知道，我去之后必有凶暴的豺狼进入你们中间，不爱惜羊群。
{Act 20:30} and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them.
{Act 20:30} 就是你们中间，也必有人起来说悖谬的话，要引诱门徒跟从他们。
{Act 20:31} Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears.
{Act 20:31} 所以你们应当警醒，记念我三年之久昼夜不住的流泪、劝戒你们各人。
{Act 20:32} And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
{Act 20:32} 如今我把你们交托神和他恩惠的道；这道能建立你们，叫你们和一切成圣的人同得基业。
{Act 20:33} I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.
{Act 20:33} 我未曾贪图一个人的金、银、衣服。
{Act 20:34} You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me.
{Act 20:34} 我这两只手常供给我和同人的需用，这是你们自己知道的。
{Act 20:35} In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
{Act 20:35} 我凡事给你们作榜样，叫你们知道应当这样劳苦，扶助软弱的人，又当记念主耶稣的话，说：‘施比受更为有福。’”
{Act 20:36} And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
{Act 20:36} 保罗说完了这话，就跪下同众人祷告。
{Act 20:37} And there was much weeping on the part of all; they embraced Paul and kissed him,
{Act 20:37} 众人痛哭，抱着保罗的颈项，和他亲嘴。
{Act 20:38} being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship.
{Act 20:38} 叫他们最伤心的，就是他说：“以后不能再见我的面”那句话，于是送他上船去了。
{Act 21:1}  And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
{Act 21:1}  我们离别了众人，就开船一直行到哥士。第二天到了罗底，从那里到帕大喇，
{Act 21:2}  And having found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
{Act 21:2}  遇见一只船要往腓尼基去，就上船起行。
{Act 21:3}  When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload its cargo.
{Act 21:3}  望见居比路，就从南边行过，往叙利亚去，我们就在推罗上岸，因为船要在那里卸货。
{Act 21:4}  And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
{Act 21:4}  找着了门徒，就在那里住了七天。他们被圣灵感动，对保罗说：“不要上耶路撒冷去。”
{Act 21:5}  When our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey, and they all, with wives and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed
{Act 21:5}  过了这几天，我们就起身前行。他们众人同妻子儿女，送我们到城外，我们都跪在岸上祷告，彼此辞别。
{Act 21:6}  and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.
{Act 21:6}  我们上了船，他们就回家去了。
{Act 21:7}  When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day.
{Act 21:7}  我们从推罗行尽了水路，来到多利买，就问那里的弟兄安，和他们同住了一天。
{Act 21:8}  On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
{Act 21:8}  第二天，我们离开那里，来到该撒利亚，就进了传福音的腓利家里，和他同住。他是那七个执事里的一个。
{Act 21:9}  He had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied.
{Act 21:9}  他有四个女儿，都是处女，是说预言的。
{Act 21:10} While we were staying for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
{Act 21:10} 我们在那里多住了几天，有一个先知，名叫亚迦布，从犹太下来，
{Act 21:11} And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'This is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'"
{Act 21:11} 到了我们这里，就拿保罗的腰带捆上自己的手脚，说：“圣灵说：犹太人在耶路撒冷，要如此捆绑这腰带的主人，把他交在外邦人手里。”
{Act 21:12} When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
{Act 21:12} 我们和那本地的人听见这话，都苦劝保罗不要上耶路撒冷去。
{Act 21:13} Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
{Act 21:13} 保罗说：“你们为什么这样痛哭，使我心碎呢？我为主耶稣的名，不但被人捆绑，就是死在耶路撒冷也是愿意的。”
{Act 21:14} And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, "Let the will of the Lord be done."
{Act 21:14} 保罗既不听劝，我们便住了口，只说：“愿主的旨意成就，”便了。
{Act 21:15} After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.
{Act 21:15} 过了几日，我们收拾行李上耶路撒冷去。
{Act 21:16} And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.
{Act 21:16} 有该撒利亚的几个门徒和我们同去，带我们到一个久为（久为：或作老）门徒的家里，叫我们与他同住；他名叫拿孙，是居比路人。
{Act 21:17} When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.
{Act 21:17} 到了耶路撒冷，弟兄们欢欢喜喜的接待我们。
{Act 21:18} On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
{Act 21:18} 第二天，保罗同我们去见雅各；长老们也都在那里。
{Act 21:19} After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
{Act 21:19} 保罗问了他们安，便将神用他传教，在外邦人中间所行之事，一一的述说了。
{Act 21:20} And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the law,
{Act 21:20} 他们听见，就归荣耀与神，对保罗说：“兄台，你看犹太人中信主的有多少万，并且都为律法热心。
{Act 21:21} and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs.
{Act 21:21} 他们听见人说：你教训一切在外邦的犹太人离弃摩西，对他们说：不要给孩子行割礼，也不要遵行条规。
{Act 21:22} What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.
{Act 21:22} 众人必听见你来了，这可怎么办呢？
{Act 21:23} Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;
{Act 21:23} 你就照着我们的话行吧？我们这里有四个人，都有愿在身。
{Act 21:24} take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the law.
{Act 21:24} 你带他们去，与他们一同行洁净的礼，替他们拿出规费，叫他们得以剃头。这样，众人就可知道，先前所听见你的事都是虚的；并可知道，你自己为人，循规蹈矩，遵行律法。
{Act 21:25} But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality."
{Act 21:25} 至于信主的外邦人，我们已经写信拟定，叫他们谨忌那祭偶像之物，和血，并勒死的牲畜，与奸淫。”
{Act 21:26} Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself along with them and went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them.
{Act 21:26} 于是保罗带着那四个人，第二天与他们一同行了洁净的礼，进了殿，报明洁净的日期满足，只等祭司为他们各人献祭。
{Act 21:27} When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,
{Act 21:27} 那七日将完，从亚西亚来的犹太人看见保罗在殿里，就耸动了众人，下手拿他，
{Act 21:28} crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place. Moreover, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."
{Act 21:28} 喊叫说：“以色列人来帮助，这就是在各处教训众人糟践我们百姓和律法，并这地方的。他又带着希利尼人进殿，污秽了这圣地。”
{Act 21:29} For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
{Act 21:29} （这话是因他们曾看见以弗所人特罗非摩同保罗在城里，以为保罗在带他进了殿。）
{Act 21:30} Then all the city was stirred up, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut.
{Act 21:30} 合城都震动，百姓一齐跑来，拿住保罗，拉他出殿，殿门立刻都关了。
{Act 21:31} And as they were seeking to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
{Act 21:31} 他们正想要杀他，有人报信给营里的千夫长说：“耶路撒冷合城都乱了。”
{Act 21:32} He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
{Act 21:32} 千夫长立时带着兵丁和几个百夫长，跑下去到他们那里。他们见了千夫长和兵丁，就止住不打保罗。
{Act 21:33} Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.
{Act 21:33} 于是千夫长上前拿住他，吩咐用两条铁链捆锁；又问他是什么人，做的是什么事。
{Act 21:34} Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.
{Act 21:34} 众人有喊叫这个的，有喊叫那个的；千夫长因为这样乱嚷，得不着实情，就吩咐人将保罗带进营楼去。
{Act 21:35} And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,
{Act 21:35} 到了台阶上，众人挤得凶猛，兵丁只得将保罗抬起来。
{Act 21:36} for the mob of the people followed, crying out, "Away with him!"
{Act 21:36} 众人跟在后面，喊着说：“除掉他！”
{Act 21:37} As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, "May I say something to you?" And he said, "Do you know Greek?
{Act 21:37} 将要带他进营楼，保罗对千夫长说：“我对你说句话可以不可以？”他说“：你懂得希利尼话吗？”
{Act 21:38} Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?"
{Act 21:38} 你莫非是从前作乱、带领四千凶徒往旷野去的那埃及人吗？
{Act 21:39} Paul replied, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people."
{Act 21:39} 保罗说：“我本是犹太人，生在基利家的大数，并不是无名小城的人。求你准我对百姓说话。”
{Act 21:40} And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:
{Act 21:40} 千夫长准了。保罗就站在台阶上，向百姓摆手，他们都静默无声，保罗便用希伯来话对他们说：
{Act 22:1}  "Brothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you."
{Act 22:1}  “诸位父兄请听，我现在对你们分诉。”
{Act 22:2}  And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they became even more quiet. And he said:
{Act 22:2}  众人听他说的是希伯来话，就更加安静了。
{Act 22:3}  "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day.
{Act 22:3}  保罗说：“我原是犹太人，生在基利家的大数，长在这城里，在迦玛列门下，按着我们祖宗严紧的律法受教，热心事奉神，像你们众人今日一样。
{Act 22:4}  I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women,
{Act 22:4}  我也曾逼迫奉这道的人，直到死地，无论男女都锁拿下监。
{Act 22:5}  as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.
{Act 22:5}  这是大祭司和众长老都可以给我作见证的。我又领了他们达与弟兄的书信，往大马色去，要把在那里奉这道的人锁拿，带到耶路撒冷受刑。
{Act 22:6}  "As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me.
{Act 22:6}  我将到大马色，正走的时候，约在晌午，忽然从天上发大光，四面照着我。
{Act 22:7}  And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'
{Act 22:7}  我就仆倒在地，听见有声音对我说：‘扫罗！扫罗！你为什么逼迫我？’
{Act 22:8}  And I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'
{Act 22:8}  我回答说：‘主啊，你是谁？’他说：‘我就是你所逼迫的拿撒勒人耶稣。’
{Act 22:9}  Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me.
{Act 22:9}  与我同行的人看见了那光，却没有听明那位对我说话的声音。
{Act 22:10} And I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.'
{Act 22:10} 我说：‘主啊，我当做什么？’主说：‘起来，进大马色去，在那里，要将所派你做的一切事告诉你。’
{Act 22:11} And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.
{Act 22:11} 我因那光的荣耀不能看见，同行的人就拉着我手进了大马色。
{Act 22:12} "And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,
{Act 22:12} 那里有一个人，名叫亚拿尼亚，按着律法是虔诚人，为一切住在那里的犹太人所称赞。
{Act 22:13} came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight.' And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him.
{Act 22:13} 他来见我，站在旁边，对我说：‘兄弟扫罗，你可以看见。’我当时往上一看，就看见了他。
{Act 22:14} And he said, 'The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth;
{Act 22:14} 他又说：‘我们祖宗的神拣选了你，叫你明白他的旨意，又得见那义者，听他口中所出的声音。
{Act 22:15} for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard.
{Act 22:15} 因为你要将所看见的，所听见的，对着万人为他作见证。
{Act 22:16} And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'
{Act 22:16} 现在你为什么耽延呢？起来，求告他的名受洗，洗去你的罪。’”
{Act 22:17} "When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance
{Act 22:17} “后来，我回到耶路撒冷，在殿里祷告的时候，魂游象外，
{Act 22:18} and saw him saying to me, 'Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'
{Act 22:18} 看见主向我说：‘你赶紧的离开耶路撒冷，不可迟延；因你为我作的见证，这里的人必不领受。’
{Act 22:19} And I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.
{Act 22:19} 我就说：‘主啊，他们知道我从前把信你的人收在监里，又在各会堂里鞭打他们。
{Act 22:20} And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him.'
{Act 22:20} 并且你的见证人司提反被害流血的时候，我也站在旁边欢喜；又看守害死他之人的衣裳。’
{Act 22:21} And he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"
{Act 22:21} 主向我说：‘你去吧！我要差你远远的往外邦人那里去。’”
{Act 22:22} Up to this word they listened to him. Then they raised their voices and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live."
{Act 22:22} 众人听他说到这句话，就高声说：“这样的人，从世上除掉他吧！他是不当活着的。”
{Act 22:23} And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,
{Act 22:23} 众人喧嚷，摔掉衣裳，把尘土向空中扬起来。
{Act 22:24} the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this.
{Act 22:24} 千夫长就吩咐将保罗带进营楼去，叫人用鞭子拷问他，要知道他们向他这样喧嚷是为什么缘故。
{Act 22:25} But when they had stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?"
{Act 22:25} 刚用皮条捆上，保罗对旁边站着的百夫长说：“人是罗马人，又没有定罪，你们就鞭打他，有这个例吗？”
{Act 22:26} When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen."
{Act 22:26} 百夫长听见这话，就去见千夫长，告诉他说：“你要作什么？这人是罗马人。”
{Act 22:27} So the tribune came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" And he said, "Yes."
{Act 22:27} 千夫长就来问保罗说：“你告诉我，你是罗马人吗？”保罗说：“是。”
{Act 22:28} The tribune answered, "I bought this citizenship for a large sum." Paul said, "But I am a citizen by birth."
{Act 22:28} 千夫长说：“我用许多银子才入了罗马的民籍。”保罗说：“我生来就是。”
{Act 22:29} So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.
{Act 22:29} 于是那些要拷问保罗的人就离开他去了。千夫长既知道他是罗马人，又因为捆绑了他，也害怕了。
{Act 22:30} But on the next day, desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.
{Act 22:30} 第二天，千夫长为要知道犹太人控告保罗的实情，便解开他，吩咐祭司长和全公会的人都聚集，将保罗带下来，叫他站在他们面前。
{Act 23:1}  And looking intently at the council, Paul said, "Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day."
{Act 23:1}  保罗定睛看着公会的人，说：“弟兄们，我在神面前行事为人都是凭着良心，直到今日。”
{Act 23:2}  And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
{Act 23:2}  大祭司亚拿尼亚就吩咐旁边站着的人打他的嘴。
{Act 23:3}  Then Paul said to him, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?"
{Act 23:3}  保罗对他说：“你这粉饰的墙，神要打你！你坐堂为的是按律法审问我，你竟违背律法，吩咐人打我吗？”
{Act 23:4}  Those who stood by said, "Would you revile God's high priest?"
{Act 23:4}  站在旁边的人说：“你辱骂神的大祭司吗？”
{Act 23:5}  And Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"
{Act 23:5}  保罗说：“弟兄们，我不晓得他是大祭司；经上记着说：‘不可毁谤你百姓的官长。’”
{Act 23:6}  Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial."
{Act 23:6}  保罗看出大众一半是撒都该人，一半是法利赛人，就在公会中大声说：“弟兄们，我是法利赛人，也是法利赛人的子孙。我现在受审问，是为盼望死人复活。”
{Act 23:7}  And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
{Act 23:7}  说了这话，法利赛人和撒都该人就争论起来，会众分为两党。
{Act 23:8}  For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
{Act 23:8}  因为撒都该人说，没有复活，也没有天使和鬼魂；法利赛人却说，两样都有。
{Act 23:9}  Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?"
{Act 23:9}  于是大大的喧嚷起来。有几个法利赛党的文士站起来争辩说：“我们看不出这人有什么恶处，倘若有鬼魂或是天使对他说过话，怎么样呢？”
{Act 23:10} And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.
{Act 23:10} 那时大起争吵，千夫长恐怕保罗被他们扯碎了，就吩咐兵丁下去，把他从众人当中抢出来，带进营楼去。
{Act 23:11} The following night the Lord stood by him and said, "Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome."
{Act 23:11} 当夜，主站在保罗旁边，说：“放心吧！你怎样在耶路撒冷为我作见证，也必怎样在罗马为我作见证。
{Act 23:12} When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
{Act 23:12} 到了天亮，犹太人同谋起誓，说：“若不先杀保罗就不吃不喝。”
{Act 23:13} There were more than forty who made this conspiracy.
{Act 23:13} 这样同心起誓的有四十多人。
{Act 23:14} They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul.
{Act 23:14} 他们来见祭司长和长老，说：“我们已经起了一个大誓，若不先杀保罗就不吃什么。
{Act 23:15} Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near."
{Act 23:15} 现在你们和公会要知会千夫长，叫他带下保罗到你们这里来，假作要详细察考他的事；我们已经预备好了，不等他来到跟前就杀他。”
{Act 23:16} Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.
{Act 23:16} 保罗的外甥听见他们设下埋伏，就来到营楼里告诉保罗。
{Act 23:17} Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him."
{Act 23:17} 保罗请一个百夫长来，说：“你领这少年人去见千夫长，他有事告诉他。”
{Act 23:18} So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, "Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you."
{Act 23:18} 于是把他领去见千夫长，说：“被囚的保罗请我到他那里，求我领这少年人来见你；他有事告诉你。”
{Act 23:19} The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"
{Act 23:19} 千夫长就拉着他的手，走到一旁，私下问他说：“你有什么事告诉我呢？”
{Act 23:20} And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him.
{Act 23:20} 他说：“犹太人已经约定，要求你明天带下保罗到公会里去，假作要详细查问他的事。
{Act 23:21} But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your consent."
{Act 23:21} 你切不要随从他们；因为他们有四十多人埋伏，已经起誓说：若不先杀保罗就不吃不喝。现在预备好了，只等你应允。”
{Act 23:22} So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, "Tell no one that you have informed me of these things."
{Act 23:22} 于是千夫长打发少年人走，嘱咐他说：“不要告诉人你将这事报给我了。”
{Act 23:23} Then he called two of the centurions and said, "Get ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night.
{Act 23:23} 千夫长便叫了两个百夫长来，说：“预备步兵二百，马兵七十，长枪手二百，今夜亥初往该撒利亚去；
{Act 23:24} Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor."
{Act 23:24} 也要预备牲口叫保罗骑上，护送到巡抚腓力斯那里去。”
{Act 23:25} And he wrote a letter to this effect:
{Act 23:25} 千夫长又写了文书，
{Act 23:26} "Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings.
{Act 23:26} 大略说：“革老丢吕西亚，请巡抚腓力斯大人安。
{Act 23:27} This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.
{Act 23:27} 这人被犹太人拿住，将要杀害，我得知他是罗马人，就带兵丁下去救他出来。
{Act 23:28} And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council.
{Act 23:28} 因要知道他们告他的缘故，我就带他下到他们的公会去，
{Act 23:29} I found that he was being accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment.
{Act 23:29} 便查知他被告是因他们律法的辩论，并没有什么该死该绑的罪名。
{Act 23:30} And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him."
{Act 23:30} 后来有人把要害他的计谋告诉我，我就立时解他到你那里去，又吩咐告他的人在你面前告他。（有古卷加：愿你平安！）”
{Act 23:31} So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
{Act 23:31} 于是，兵丁照所吩咐他们的，将保罗夜里带到安提帕底。
{Act 23:32} And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him.
{Act 23:32} 第二天，让马兵护送，他们就回营楼去。
{Act 23:33} When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.
{Act 23:33} 马兵来到该撒利亚，把文书呈给巡抚，便叫保罗站在他面前。
{Act 23:34} On reading the letter, he asked what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia,
{Act 23:34} 巡抚看了文书，问保罗是哪省的人，既晓得他是基利家人，
{Act 23:35} he said, "I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive." And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium.
{Act 23:35} 就说：“等告你的人来到，我要细听你的事”；便吩咐人把他看守在希律的衙门里。
{Act 24:1}  And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before the governor their case against Paul.
{Act 24:1}  过了五天，大祭司亚拿尼亚同几个长老，和一个辩士帖土罗下来，向巡抚控告保罗。
{Act 24:2}  And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: "Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation,
{Act 24:2}  保罗被提了来，帖土罗就告他说：
{Act 24:3}  in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude.
{Act 24:3}  “腓力斯大人，我们因你得以大享太平，并且这一国的弊病，因着你的先见得以更正了；我们随时随地满心感谢不尽。
{Act 24:4}  But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly.
{Act 24:4}  惟恐多说，你嫌烦絮，只求你宽容听我们说几句话。
{Act 24:5}  For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
{Act 24:5}  我们看这个人，如同瘟疫一般，是鼓动普天下众犹太人生乱的，又是拿撒勒教党里的一个头目，
{Act 24:6}  He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him.
{Act 24:6}  连圣殿他也想要污秽；我们把他捉住了。（有古卷在此有：要按我们的律法审问，
{Act 24:7}  and we would have judged him according to our law. But the chief captain Lysias came and with great violence took him out of our hands, commanding his accusers to come before you.
{Act 24:7}  不料千夫长吕西亚前来，甚是强横，从我们手中把他夺去，吩咐告他的人到你这里来。）
{Act 24:8}  By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him."
{Act 24:8}  你自己究问他，就可以知道我们告他的一切事了。”
{Act 24:9}  The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.
{Act 24:9}  众犹太人也随着告他说：“事情诚然是这样。”
{Act 24:10} And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied: "Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense.
{Act 24:10} 巡抚点头叫保罗说话。他就说：“我知道你在这国里断事多年，所以我乐意为自己分诉。
{Act 24:11} You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,
{Act 24:11} 你查问就可以知道，从我上耶路撒冷礼拜到今日不过有十二天。
{Act 24:12} and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city.
{Act 24:12} 他们并没有看见我在殿里，或是在会堂里，或是在城里，和人辩论，耸动众人。
{Act 24:13} Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me.
{Act 24:13} 他们现在所告我的事并不能对你证实了。
{Act 24:14} But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,
{Act 24:14} 但有一件事，我向你承认，就是他们所称为异端的道，我正按着那道事奉我祖宗的神，又信合乎律法的和先知书上一切所记载的，
{Act 24:15} having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.
{Act 24:15} 并且靠着神，盼望死人，无论善恶，都要复活，就是他们自己也有这个盼望。
{Act 24:16} So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man.
{Act 24:16} 我因此自己勉励，对神对人，常存无亏的良心。
{Act 24:17} Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings.
{Act 24:17} 过了几年，我带着周济本国的捐项和供献的物上去。
{Act 24:18} While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia--
{Act 24:18} 正献的时候，他们看见我在殿里已经洁净了，并没有聚众，也没有吵嚷，惟有几个从亚西亚来的犹太人。
{Act 24:19} they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me.
{Act 24:19} 他们若有告我的事，就应当到你面前来告我。
{Act 24:20} Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council,
{Act 24:20} 即或不然，这些人若看出我站在公会前，有妄为的地方，他们自己也可以说明。
{Act 24:21} other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: 'It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.'"
{Act 24:21} 纵然有，也不过一句话，就是我站在他们中间大声说：‘我今日在你们面前受审，是为死人复活的道理。’”
{Act 24:22} But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, "When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case."
{Act 24:22} 腓力斯本是详细晓得这道，就支吾他们说：“且等千夫长吕西亚下来，我要审断你们的事。”
{Act 24:23} Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.
{Act 24:23} 于是吩咐百夫长看守保罗，并且宽待他，也不拦阻他的亲友来供给他。
{Act 24:24} After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.
{Act 24:24} 过了几天，腓力斯和他夫人犹太的女子土西拉一同来到，就叫了保罗来，听他讲论信基督耶稣的道。
{Act 24:25} And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, "Go away for the present. When I get an opportunity I will summon you."
{Act 24:25} 保罗讲论公义、节制，和将来的审判。腓力斯甚觉恐惧，说：“你暂且去吧，等我得便再叫你来。”
{Act 24:26} At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.
{Act 24:26} 腓力斯又指望保罗送他银钱，所以屡次叫他来，和他谈论。
{Act 24:27} When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.
{Act 24:27} 过了两年，波求非斯都接了腓力斯的任；腓力斯要讨犹太人的喜欢，就留保罗在监里。
{Act 25:1}  Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
{Act 25:1}  非斯都到了任，过了三天，就从该撒利亚上耶路撒冷去。
{Act 25:2}  And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him,
{Act 25:2}  祭司长和犹太人的首领向他控告保罗，
{Act 25:3}  asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalem--because they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way.
{Act 25:3}  又央告他，求他的情，将保罗提到耶路撒冷来，他们要在路上埋伏杀害他。
{Act 25:4}  Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly.
{Act 25:4}  非斯都却回答说：“保罗押在该撒利亚，我自己快要往那里去”；
{Act 25:5}  "So," said he, "let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him."
{Act 25:5}  又说：“你们中间有权势的人与我一同下去，那人若有什么不是，就可以告他。”
{Act 25:6}  After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.
{Act 25:6}  非斯都在他们那里住了不过十天八天，就下该撒利亚去；第二天坐堂，吩咐将保罗提上来。
{Act 25:7}  When he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove.
{Act 25:7}  保罗来了，那些从耶路撒冷下来的犹太人周围站着，将许多重大的事控告他，都是不能证实的。
{Act 25:8}  Paul argued in his defense, "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offense."
{Act 25:8}  保罗分诉说：“无论犹太人的律法，或是圣殿，或是该撒，我都没有干犯。”
{Act 25:9}  But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, "Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me?"
{Act 25:9}  但非斯都要讨犹太人的喜欢，就问保罗说：“你愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里听我审断这事吗？”
{Act 25:10} But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you yourself know very well.
{Act 25:10} 保罗说：“我站在该撒的堂前，这就是我应当受审的地方。我向犹太人并没有行过什么不义的事，这也是你明明知道的。
{Act 25:11} If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar."
{Act 25:11} 我若行了不义的事，犯了什么该死的罪，就是死，我也不辞。他们所告我的事若都不实，就没有人可以把我交给他们。我要上告于该撒。”
{Act 25:12} Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, "To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go."
{Act 25:12} 非斯都和议会商量了，就说：“你既上告于该撒，可以往该撒那里去。”
{Act 25:13} Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus.
{Act 25:13} 过了些日子，亚基帕王和百尼基氏来到该撒利亚，问非斯都安。
{Act 25:14} And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a man left prisoner by Felix,
{Act 25:14} 在那里住了多日，非斯都将保罗的事告诉王，说：“这里有一个人，是腓力斯留在监里的。
{Act 25:15} and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.
{Act 25:15} 我在耶路撒冷的时候，祭司长和犹太的长老将他的事禀报了我，求我定他的罪。
{Act 25:16} I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him.
{Act 25:16} 我对他们说，无论什么人，被告还没有和原告对质，未得机会分诉所告他的事，就先定他的罪，这不是罗马人的条例。
{Act 25:17} So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought.
{Act 25:17} 及至他们都来到这里，我就不耽延，第二天便坐堂，吩咐把那人提上来。
{Act 25:18} When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed.
{Act 25:18} 告他的人站着告他；所告的，并没有我所逆料的那等恶事。
{Act 25:19} Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.
{Act 25:19} 不过是有几样辩论，为他们自己敬鬼神的事，又为一个人名叫耶稣，是已经死了，保罗却说他是活着的。
{Act 25:20} Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them.
{Act 25:20} 这些事当怎样究问，我心里作难，所以问他说：‘你愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里为这些事听审吗？’
{Act 25:21} But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar."
{Act 25:21} 但保罗求我留下他，要听皇上审断，我就吩咐把他留下，等我解他到该撒那里去。”
{Act 25:22} Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," said he, "you will hear him."
{Act 25:22} 亚基帕对非斯都说：“我自己也愿听这人辩论。”非斯都说：“明天你可以听。”
{Act 25:23} So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
{Act 25:23} 第二天，亚基帕和百尼基大张威势而来，同着众千夫长和城里的尊贵人进了公厅。非斯都吩咐一声，就有人将保罗带进来。
{Act 25:24} And Festus said, "King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
{Act 25:24} 非斯都说：“亚基帕王和在这里的诸位啊，你们看这人，就是一切犹太人，在耶路撒冷和这里，曾向我恳求、呼叫说：‘不可容他再活着。’”
{Act 25:25} But I found that he had done nothing deserving death. And as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to go ahead and send him.
{Act 25:25} 但我查明他没有犯什么该死的罪，并且他自己上告于皇帝，所以我定意把他解去。
{Act 25:26} But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write.
{Act 25:26} 论到这人，我没有确实的事可以奏明主上。因此，我带他到你们面前，也特意带他到你亚基帕王面前，为要在查问之后有所陈奏。
{Act 25:27} For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him."
{Act 25:27} 据我看来，解送囚犯，不指明他的罪案是不合理的。”
{Act 26:1}  So Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:
{Act 26:1}  亚基帕对保罗说：“准你为自己辩明。”于是保罗伸手分诉，说：
{Act 26:2}  "I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am going to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews,
{Act 26:2}  “亚基帕王啊，犹太人所告我的一切事，今日得在你面前分诉，实为万幸；
{Act 26:3}  especially because you are familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
{Act 26:3}  更可幸的，是你熟悉犹太人的规矩和他们的辩论；所以求你耐心听我。
{Act 26:4}  "My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews.
{Act 26:4}  我从起初在本国的民中，并在耶路撒冷，自幼为人如何，犹太人都知道。
{Act 26:5}  They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee.
{Act 26:5}  他们若肯作见证就晓得，我从起初是按着我们教中最严紧的教门作了法利赛人。
{Act 26:6}  And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers,
{Act 26:6}  现在我站在这里受审，是因为指望神向我们祖宗所应许的；
{Act 26:7}  to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king!
{Act 26:7}  这应许，我们十二个支派，昼夜切切的事奉神，都指望得着。王啊，我被犹太人控告，就是因这指望。
{Act 26:8}  Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?
{Act 26:8}  神叫死人复活，你们为什么看作不可信的呢？
{Act 26:9}  "I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
{Act 26:9}  从前我自己以为应当多方攻击拿撒勒人耶稣的名，
{Act 26:10} And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.
{Act 26:10} 我在耶路撒冷也曾这样行了。既从祭司长得了权柄，我就把许多圣徒囚在监里。他们被杀，我也出名定案。
{Act 26:11} And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme, and in raging fury against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
{Act 26:11} 在各会堂，我屡次用刑强逼他们说亵渎的话，又分外恼恨他们，甚至追逼他们，直到外邦的城邑。”
{Act 26:12} "In this connection I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.
{Act 26:12} “那时，我领了祭司长的权柄和命令，往大马色去。
{Act 26:13} At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me.
{Act 26:13} 王啊，我在路上，晌午的时候，看见从天发光，比日头还亮，四面照着我并与我同行的人。
{Act 26:14} And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
{Act 26:14} 我们都仆倒在地，我就听见有声音用希伯来话向我说：‘扫罗！扫罗！为什么逼迫我？你用脚踢刺是难的！’
{Act 26:15} And I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.
{Act 26:15} 我说：‘主啊，你是谁？’主说：‘我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。
{Act 26:16} But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you,
{Act 26:16} 你起来站着，我特意向你显现，要派你作执事，作见证，将你所看见的事和我将要指示你的事证明出来。；
{Act 26:17} delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles--to whom I am sending you
{Act 26:17} 我也要救你脱离百姓和外邦人的手。
{Act 26:18} to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'
{Act 26:18} 我差你到他们那里去，要叫他们的眼睛得开，从黑暗中归向光明，从撒但权下归向神；又因信我，得蒙赦罪，和一切成圣的人同得基业。’”
{Act 26:19} "Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
{Act 26:19} “亚基帕王啊，我故此没有违背那从天上来的异象；
{Act 26:20} but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance.
{Act 26:20} 先在大马色，后在耶路撒冷和犹太全地，以及外邦，劝勉他们应当悔改归向神，行事与悔改的心相称。
{Act 26:21} For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.
{Act 26:21} 因此，犹太人在殿里拿住我，想要杀我。
{Act 26:22} To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:
{Act 26:22} 然而我蒙神的帮助，直到今日还站得住，对着尊贵、卑贱、老幼作见证；所讲的并不外乎众先知和摩西所说将来必成的事，
{Act 26:23} that the Christ must suffer and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles."
{Act 26:23} 就是基督必须受害，并且因从死里复活，要首先把光明的道传给百姓和外邦人。”
{Act 26:24} And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind."
{Act 26:24} 保罗这样分诉，非斯都大声说：“保罗，你癫狂了吧。你的学问太大，反叫你癫狂了！”
{Act 26:25} But Paul said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words.
{Act 26:25} 保罗说：“非斯都大人，我不是癫狂，我说的乃是真实明白话。
{Act 26:26} For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.
{Act 26:26} 王也晓得这些事，所以我向王放胆直言，我深信这些事没有一件向王隐藏的，因都不是在背地里做的。
{Act 26:27} King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."
{Act 26:27} 亚基帕王啊，你信先知吗？我知道你是信的。”
{Act 26:28} And Agrippa said to Paul, "In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian?"
{Act 26:28} 亚基帕对保罗说：“你想少微一劝，便叫我作基督徒啊（或作：你这样劝我，几乎叫我作基督徒了）！”
{Act 26:29} And Paul said, "Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am--except for these chains."
{Act 26:29} 保罗说：“无论是少劝是多劝，我向神所求的，不但你一个人，就是今天一切听我的，都要像我一样，只是不要像我有这些锁链。”
{Act 26:30} Then the king rose, and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them.
{Act 26:30} 于是，王和巡抚并百尼基与同坐的人都起来，
{Act 26:31} And when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, "This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment."
{Act 26:31} 退到里面，彼此谈论说：“这人并没有犯什么该死该绑的罪。”
{Act 26:32} And Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
{Act 26:32} 亚基帕又对非斯都说：“这人若没有上告于该撒，就可以释放了。”
{Act 27:1}  And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius.
{Act 27:1}  非斯都既然定规了，叫我们坐船往义大利去，便将保罗和别的囚犯交给御营里的一个百夫长，名叫犹流。
{Act 27:2}  And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
{Act 27:2}  有一只亚大米田的船，要沿着亚西亚一带地方的海边走，我们就上了那船开行；有马其顿的帖撒罗尼迦人亚里达古和我们同去。
{Act 27:3}  The next day we put in at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for.
{Act 27:3}  第二天，到了西顿；犹流宽待保罗，准他往朋友那里去，受他们的照应。
{Act 27:4}  And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.
{Act 27:4}  从那里又开船，因为风不顺，就贴着居比路背风岸行去。
{Act 27:5}  And when we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.
{Act 27:5}  过了基利家、旁非利亚前面的海，就到了吕家的每拉。
{Act 27:6}  There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board.
{Act 27:6}  在那里，百夫长遇见一只亚力山大的船，要往义大利去，便叫我们上了那船。
{Act 27:7}  We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.
{Act 27:7}  一连多日，船行得慢，仅仅来到革尼土的对面。因为被风拦阻，就贴着革哩底背风岸，从撒摩尼对面行过。
{Act 27:8}  Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.
{Act 27:8}  我们沿岸行走，仅仅来到一个地方，名叫佳澳；离那里不远，有拉西亚城。
{Act 27:9}  Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over, Paul advised them,
{Act 27:9}  走的日子多了，已经过了禁食的节期，行船又危险，保罗就劝众人说：
{Act 27:10} saying, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
{Act 27:10} “众位，我看这次行船，不但货物和船要受伤损，大遭破坏，连我们的性命也难保。”
{Act 27:11} But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.
{Act 27:11} 但百夫长信从掌船的和船主，不信从保罗所说的。
{Act 27:12} And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.
{Act 27:12} 且因在这海口过冬不便，船上的人就多半说：不如开船离开这地方，或者能到非尼基过冬。非尼基是革哩底的一个海口，一面朝东北，一面朝东南。
{Act 27:13} Now when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore.
{Act 27:13} 这时，微微起了南风，他们以为得意，就起了锚，贴近革哩底行去。
{Act 27:14} But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land.
{Act 27:14} 不多几时，狂风从岛上扑下来；那风名叫“友拉革罗。”
{Act 27:15} And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.
{Act 27:15} 船被风抓住，敌不住风，我们就任风刮去。
{Act 27:16} Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the ship's boat.
{Act 27:16} 贴着一个小岛的背风岸奔行，那岛名叫高大，在那里仅仅收住了小船。
{Act 27:17} After hoisting it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and thus they were driven along.
{Act 27:17} 既然把小船拉上来，就用缆索捆绑船底，又恐怕在赛耳底沙滩上搁了浅，就落下篷来，任船飘去。
{Act 27:18} Since we were violently storm-tossed, they began the next day to jettison the cargo.
{Act 27:18} 我们被风浪逼得甚急，第二天众人就把货物抛在海里。
{Act 27:19} And on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.
{Act 27:19} 到第三天，他们又亲手把船上的器具抛弃了。
{Act 27:20} When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.
{Act 27:20} 太阳和星辰多日不显露，又有狂风大浪催逼，我们得救的指望就都绝了。
{Act 27:21} Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, "Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss.
{Act 27:21} 众人多日没有吃什么，保罗就出来站在他们中间，说：“众位，你们本该听我的话，不离开革哩底，免得遭这样的伤损破坏。
{Act 27:22} Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
{Act 27:22} 现在我还劝你们放心，你们的性命一个也不失丧，惟独失丧这船。
{Act 27:23} For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship,
{Act 27:23} 因我所属所事奉的神，他的使者昨夜站在我旁边，说：
{Act 27:24} and he said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'
{Act 27:24} ‘保罗，不要害怕，你必定站在该撒面前，并且与你同船的人，神都赐给你了。’
{Act 27:25} So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.
{Act 27:25} 所以众位可以放心，我信神他怎样对我说：事情也要怎样成就。
{Act 27:26} But we must run aground on some island."
{Act 27:26} 只是我们必要撞在一个岛上。”
{Act 27:27} When the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land.
{Act 27:27} 到了第十四天夜间，船在亚底亚海飘来飘去。约到半夜，水手以为渐近旱地，
{Act 27:28} So they took a sounding and found twenty fathoms. A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms.
{Act 27:28} 就探深浅，探得有十二丈；稍往前行，又探深浅，探得有九丈。
{Act 27:29} And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.
{Act 27:29} 恐怕撞在石头上，就从船尾抛下四个锚，盼望天亮。
{Act 27:30} And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the ship's boat into the sea under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,
{Act 27:30} 水手想要逃出船去，把小船放在海里，假作要从船头抛锚的样子。
{Act 27:31} Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."
{Act 27:31} 保罗对百夫长和兵丁说：“这些人若不等在船上，你们必不能得救。”
{Act 27:32} Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship's boat and let it go.
{Act 27:32} 于是兵丁砍断小船的绳子，由他飘去。
{Act 27:33} As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing.
{Act 27:33} 天渐亮的时候，保罗劝众人都吃饭，说：“你们悬望忍饿不吃什么，已经十四天了。
{Act 27:34} Therefore I urge you to take some food. For it will give you strength, for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you."
{Act 27:34} 所以我劝你们吃饭，这是关乎你们救命的事；因为你们各人连一根头发也不至于损坏。”
{Act 27:35} And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat.
{Act 27:35} 保罗说了这话，就拿着饼，在众人面前祝谢了神，擘开吃。
{Act 27:36} Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves.
{Act 27:36} 于是他们都放下心，也就吃了。
{Act 27:37} (We were in all 276 persons in the ship.)
{Act 27:37} 我们在船上的共有二百七十六个人。
{Act 27:38} And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
{Act 27:38} 他们吃饱了，就把船上的麦子抛在海里，为要叫船轻一点。
{Act 27:39} Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore.
{Act 27:39} 到了天亮，他们不认识那地方，但见一个海湾，有岸可登，就商议能把船拢进去不能。
{Act 27:40} So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders. Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach.
{Act 27:40} 于是砍断缆索，弃锚在海里；同时也松开舵绳，拉起头篷，顺着风向岸行去。
{Act 27:41} But striking a reef, they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf.
{Act 27:41} 但遇着两水夹流的地方，就把船搁了浅；船头胶住不动，船尾被浪的猛力冲坏。
{Act 27:42} The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape.
{Act 27:42} 兵丁的意思要把囚犯杀了，恐怕有洑水脱逃的。
{Act 27:43} But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land,
{Act 27:43} 但百夫长要救保罗，不准他们任意而行，就吩咐会洑水的，跳下水去先上岸；
{Act 27:44} and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.
{Act 27:44} 其余的人可以用板子或船上的零碎东西上岸。这样，众人都得了救，上了岸。
{Act 28:1}  After we were brought safely through, we then learned that the island was called Malta.
{Act 28:1}  我们既已得救，才知道那岛名叫米利大。
{Act 28:2}  The native people showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.
{Act 28:2}  土人看待我们，有非常的情分；因为当时下雨，天气又冷，就生火接待我们众人。
{Act 28:3}  When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.
{Act 28:3}  那时，保罗拾起一捆柴，放在火上，有一条毒蛇，因为热了出来，咬住他的手。
{Act 28:4}  When the native people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live."
{Act 28:4}  土人看见那毒蛇悬在他手上，就彼此说：“这人必是个凶手，虽然从海里救上来，天理还不容他活着。”
{Act 28:5}  He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.
{Act 28:5}  保罗竟把那毒蛇甩在火里，并没有受伤。
{Act 28:6}  They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
{Act 28:6}  土人想他必要肿起来，或是忽然仆倒死了；看了多时，见他无害，就转念，说：“他是个神。”
{Act 28:7}  Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
{Act 28:7}  离那地方不远，有田产是岛长部百流的；他接纳我们，尽情款待三日。
{Act 28:8}  It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him.
{Act 28:8}  当时，部百流的父亲患热病和痢疾躺着。保罗进去，为他祷告，按手在他身上，治好了他。
{Act 28:9}  And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.
{Act 28:9}  从此，岛上其余的病人也来，得了医治。
{Act 28:10} They also honored us greatly, and when we were about to sail, they put on board whatever we needed.
{Act 28:10} 他们又多方的尊敬我们；到了开船的时候，也把我们所需用的送到船上。
{Act 28:11} After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the twin gods as a figurehead.
{Act 28:11} 过了三个月，我们上了亚力山大的船往前行；这船以“丢斯双子”为记，是在那海岛过了冬的。
{Act 28:12} Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
{Act 28:12} 到了叙拉古，我们停泊三日；
{Act 28:13} And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.
{Act 28:13} 又从那里绕行，来到利基翁。过了一天，起了南风，第二天就来到部丢利。
{Act 28:14} There we found brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.
{Act 28:14} 在那里遇见弟兄们，请我们与他们同住了七天。这样，我们来到罗马。
{Act 28:15} And the brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage.
{Act 28:15} 那里的弟兄们一听见我们的信息就出来，到亚比乌市和三馆地方迎接我们。保罗见了他们，就感谢神，放心壮胆。
{Act 28:16} And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.
{Act 28:16} 进了罗马城，（有古卷加：百夫长把众囚犯交给御营的统领，惟有）保罗蒙准和一个看守他的兵另住在一处。
{Act 28:17} After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews, and when they had gathered, he said to them, "Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
{Act 28:17} 过了三天，保罗请犹太人的首领来。他们来了，就对他们说：“弟兄们，我虽没有作什么事干犯本国的百姓和我们祖宗的规条，却被锁绑，从耶路撒冷解在罗马人的手里。
{Act 28:18} When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.
{Act 28:18} 他们审问了我，就愿意释放我；因为在我身上，并没有该死的罪。
{Act 28:19} But because the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar--though I had no charge to bring against my nation.
{Act 28:19} 无奈犹太人不服，我不得已，只好上告于该撒，并非有什么事要控告我本国的百姓。
{Act 28:20} For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am wearing this chain."
{Act 28:20} 因此，我请你们来见面说话，我原为以色列人所指望的，被这链子捆锁。”
{Act 28:21} And they said to him, "We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you.
{Act 28:21} 他们说：“我们并没有接着从犹太来论你的信，也没有弟兄到这里来报给我们说你有什么不好处。
{Act 28:22} But we desire to hear from you what your views are, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against."
{Act 28:22} 但我们愿意听你的意见如何；因为这教门，我们晓得是到处被毁谤的。”
{Act 28:23} When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers. From morning till evening he expounded to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.
{Act 28:23} 他们和保罗约定了日子，就有许多人到他的寓处来。保罗从早到晚，对他们讲论这事，证明神国的道，引摩西的律法和先知的书，以耶稣的事劝勉他们。
{Act 28:24} And some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved.
{Act 28:24} 他所说的话，有信的，有不信的。
{Act 28:25} And disagreeing among themselves, they departed after Paul had made one statement: "The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:
{Act 28:25} 他们彼此不合，就散了；未散以先，保罗说了一句话，说：“圣灵藉先知以赛亚向你们祖宗所说的话是不错的。
{Act 28:26} "'Go to this people, and say, "You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive."
{Act 28:26} 他说：你去告诉这百姓说：你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不晓得；
{Act 28:27} For this people's heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'
{Act 28:27} 因为这百姓油蒙了心，耳朵发沉，眼睛闭着；恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，我就医治他们。
{Act 28:28} Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen."
{Act 28:28} 所以你们当知道，神这救恩，如今传给外邦人，他们也必听受。”（有古卷在此有：
{Act 28:29} And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much dispute among themselves.
{Act 28:29} 保罗说了这话，犹太人议论纷纷的就走了。）
{Act 28:30} He lived there two whole years at his own expense, in his own hired dwelling. and welcomed all who came to him,
{Act 28:30} 保罗在自己所租的房子里住了足足两年。凡来见他的人，他全都接待，
{Act 28:31} proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.
{Act 28:31} 放胆传讲神国的道，将主耶稣基督的事教导人，并没有人禁止。
