{1Ch 10:1}  非利士人与以色列人争战，以色列人在非利士人面前逃跑，在基利波山有被杀仆倒的。
{1Ch 10:2}  And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
{1Ch 10:2}  非利士人紧追扫罗和他儿子们，就杀了扫罗的儿子约拿单、亚比拿达、麦基舒亚。
{1Ch 10:3}  The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.
{1Ch 10:3}  势派甚大，扫罗被弓箭手追上，射伤甚重，
{1Ch 10:4}  Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mistreat me." But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
{1Ch 10:4}  就吩咐拿他兵器的人说：“你拔出刀来，将我刺死，免得那些未受割礼的人来凌辱我。”但拿兵器的人甚惧怕，不肯刺他；
{1Ch 10:5}  And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.
{1Ch 10:5}  扫罗就自己伏在刀上死了。拿兵器的人见扫罗已死，也伏在刀上死了。
{1Ch 10:6}  Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.
{1Ch 10:6}  这样，扫罗和他三个儿子，并他的全家都一同死亡。
{1Ch 10:7}  And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them.
{1Ch 10:7}  住平原的以色列众人见以色列军兵逃跑，扫罗和他儿子都死了，也就弃城逃跑，非利士人便来住在其中。
{1Ch 10:8}  The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
{1Ch 10:8}  次日，非利士人来剥那被杀之人的衣服，看见扫罗和他儿子仆倒在基利波山，
{1Ch 10:9}  And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.
{1Ch 10:9}  就剥了他的军装，割下他的首级，打发人到（到：或作送到）非利士地的四境报信与他们的偶像和众民，
{1Ch 10:10} And they put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
{1Ch 10:10} 又将扫罗的军装放在他们神的庙里，将他的首级钉在大衮庙中。
{1Ch 10:11} But when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
{1Ch 10:11} 基列雅比人听见非利士人向扫罗所行的一切事，
{1Ch 10:12} all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
{1Ch 10:12} 他们中间所有的勇士就起身前去，将扫罗和他儿子的尸身送到雅比，将他们的尸骨葬在雅比的橡树下，就禁食七日。
{1Ch 10:13} So Saul died for his breach of faith. He broke faith with the LORD in that he did not keep the command of the LORD, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance.
{1Ch 10:13} 这样，扫罗死了。因为他干犯耶和华，没有遵守耶和华的命；又因他求问交鬼的妇人，
{1Ch 10:14} He did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.
{1Ch 10:14} 没有求问耶和华，所以耶和华使他被杀，把国归于耶西的儿子大卫。
{1Ch 11:1}  Then all Israel gathered together to David at Hebron and said, "Behold, we are your bone and flesh.
{1Ch 11:1}  以色列众人聚集到希伯仑见大卫，说：“我们原是你的骨肉。
{1Ch 11:2}  In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the LORD your God said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.'"
{1Ch 11:2}  从前扫罗作王的时候，率领以色列人出入的是你；耶和华你的神也曾应许你说：‘你必牧养我的民以色列，作以色列的君。’”
{1Ch 11:3}  So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
{1Ch 11:3}  于是以色列的长老都来到希伯仑见大卫王。大卫在希伯仑耶和华面前与他们立约，他们就膏大卫作以色列的王，是照耶和华藉撒母耳所说的话。
{1Ch 11:4}  And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is, Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
{1Ch 11:4}  大卫和以色列众人到了耶路撒冷，就是耶布斯；那时耶布斯人住在那里。
{1Ch 11:5}  The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You will not come in here." Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
{1Ch 11:5}  耶布斯人对大卫说：“你决不能进这地方。”然而大卫攻取锡安的保障，就是大卫的城。
{1Ch 11:6}  David said, "Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and commander." And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.
{1Ch 11:6}  大卫说：“谁先攻打耶布斯人，必作首领元帅。”洗鲁雅的儿子约押先上去，就作了元帅。
{1Ch 11:7}  And David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.
{1Ch 11:7}  大卫住在保障里，所以那保障叫作大卫城。
{1Ch 11:8}  And he built the city all around from the Millo in complete circuit, and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
{1Ch 11:8}  大卫又从米罗起，四围建筑城墙，其余的是约押修理。
{1Ch 11:9}  And David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him.
{1Ch 11:9}  大卫日见强盛，因为万军之耶和华与他同在。
{1Ch 11:10} Now these are the chiefs of David's mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
{1Ch 11:10} 以下记录跟随大卫勇士的首领，就是奋勇帮助他得国、照着耶和华吩咐以色列人的话、与以色列人一同立他作王的。
{1Ch 11:11} This is an account of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, was chief of the three. He wielded his spear against 300 whom he killed at one time.
{1Ch 11:11} 大卫勇士的数目记在下面：哈革摩尼的儿子雅朔班，他是军长的统领，一时举枪杀了三百人。
{1Ch 11:12} And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite.
{1Ch 11:12} 其次是亚合人犰多的儿子以利亚撒，他是三个勇士里的一个。
{1Ch 11:13} He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines.
{1Ch 11:13} 他从前与大卫在巴斯达闵，非利士人聚集要打仗。那里有一块长满大麦的田，众民就在非利士人面前逃跑；
{1Ch 11:14} But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the Philistines. And the LORD saved them by a great victory.
{1Ch 11:14} 这勇士便站在那田间击杀非利士人，救护了那田。耶和华使以色列人大获全胜。
{1Ch 11:15} Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
{1Ch 11:15} 三十个勇士中的三个人下到磐石那里，进了亚杜兰洞见大卫；非利士的军队在利乏音谷安营。
{1Ch 11:16} David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
{1Ch 11:16} 那时大卫在山寨，非利士人的防营在伯利恒。
{1Ch 11:17} And David said longingly, "Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!"
{1Ch 11:17} 大卫渴想，说：“甚愿有人将伯利恒城门旁井里的水打来给我喝！”
{1Ch 11:18} Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it. He poured it out to the LORD
{1Ch 11:18} 这三个勇士就闯过非利士人的营盘，从伯利恒城门旁的井里打水，拿来奉给大卫。他却不肯喝，将水奠在耶和华面前，
{1Ch 11:19} and said, "Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it." Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
{1Ch 11:19} 说：“我的神啊，这三个人冒死去打水，这水好像他们的血一般，我断不敢喝！”如此，大卫不肯喝。这是三个勇士所做的事。
{1Ch 11:20} Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against 300 men and killed them and won a name beside the three.
{1Ch 11:20} 约押的兄弟亚比筛是这三个勇士的首领；他举枪杀了三百人，就在三个勇士里得了名。
{1Ch 11:21} He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.
{1Ch 11:21} 他在这三个勇士里是最尊贵的，所以作他们的首领；只是不及前三个勇士。
{1Ch 11:22} And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two heroes of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
{1Ch 11:22} 有甲薛勇士耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅行过大能的事：他杀了摩押人亚利伊勒的两个儿子，又在下雪的时候下坑里去杀了一个狮子，
{1Ch 11:23} And he struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver's beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
{1Ch 11:23} 又杀了一个埃及人。埃及人身高五肘，手里拿着枪，枪杆粗如织布的机轴；比拿雅只拿着棍子下去，从埃及人手里夺过枪来，用那枪将他刺死。
{1Ch 11:24} These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and won a name beside the three mighty men.
{1Ch 11:24} 这是耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅所行的事，就在三个勇士里得了名。
{1Ch 11:25} He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
{1Ch 11:25} 他比那三十个勇士都尊贵，只是不及前三个勇士。大卫立他作护卫长。

{1Ch 12:15} 正月，约但河水涨过两岸的时候，他们过河，使一切住平原的人东奔西逃。
{1Ch 12:16} And some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.
{1Ch 12:16} 又有便雅悯和犹大人到山寨大卫那里。
{1Ch 12:17} David went out to meet them and said to them, "If you have come to me in friendship to help me, my heart will be joined to you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, although there is no wrong in my hands, then may the God of our fathers see and rebuke you."
{1Ch 12:17} 大卫出去迎接他们，对他们说：“你们若是和和平平地来帮助我，我心就与你们相契；你们若是将我这无罪的人卖在敌人手里，愿我们列祖的神察看责罚。”
{1Ch 12:18} Then the Spirit clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said, "We are yours, O David, and with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers! For your God helps you." Then David received them and made them officers of his troops.

{1Ch 12:19} Some of the men of Manasseh deserted to David when he came with the Philistines for the battle against Saul. (Yet he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines took counsel and sent him away, saying, "At peril to our heads he will desert to his master Saul.")
{1Ch 12:19} 大卫从前与非利士人同去，要与扫罗争战，有些玛拿西人来投奔大卫，他们却没有帮助非利士人；因为非利士人的首领商议，打发他们回去，说：“恐怕大卫拿我们的首级，归降他的主人扫罗。”
{1Ch 12:20} As he went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh deserted to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.
{1Ch 12:20} 大卫往洗革拉去的时候，有玛拿西人的千夫长押拿、约撒拔、耶叠、米迦勒、约撒拔、以利户、洗勒太都来投奔他。

{1Ch 12:38} 以上都是能守行伍的战士，他们都诚心来到希伯仑，要立大卫作以色列的王。以色列其余的人也都一心要立大卫作王。
{1Ch 12:39} And they were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had made preparation for them.
{1Ch 12:39} 他们在那里三日，与大卫一同吃喝，因为他们的族弟兄给他们预备了。
{1Ch 12:40} And also their relatives, from as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, came bringing food on donkeys and on camels and on mules and on oxen, abundant provisions of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, and wine and oil, oxen and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.
{1Ch 12:40} 靠近他们的人以及以萨迦、西布伦、拿弗他利人将许多面饼、无花果饼、干葡萄、酒、油，用驴、骆驼、骡子、牛驮来，又带了许多的牛和羊来，因为以色列人甚是欢乐。
{1Ch 13:1}  David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with every leader.
{1Ch 13:1}  大卫与千夫长、百夫长，就是一切首领商议。
{1Ch 13:2}  And David said to all the assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you and from the LORD our God, let us send abroad to our brothers who remain in all the lands of Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites in the cities that have pasturelands, that they may be gathered to us.
{1Ch 13:2}  大卫对以色列全会众说：“你们若以为美，见这事是出于耶和华我们的神，我们就差遣人走遍以色列地，见我们未来的弟兄，又见住在有郊野之城的祭司利未人，使他们都到这里来聚集。
{1Ch 13:3}  Then let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul."
{1Ch 13:3}  我们要把神的约柜运到我们这里来；因为在扫罗年间，我们没有在约柜前求问神。”
{1Ch 13:4}  All the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
{1Ch 13:4}  全会众都说可以如此行；这事在众民眼中都看为好。
{1Ch 13:5}  So David assembled all Israel from the Nile of Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
{1Ch 13:5}  于是，大卫将以色列人从埃及的西曷河直到哈马口都招聚了来，要从基列耶琳将神的约柜运来。
{1Ch 13:6}  And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim that belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD who sits enthroned above the cherubim.
{1Ch 13:6}  大卫率领以色列众人上到巴拉，就是属犹大的基列耶琳，要从那里将约柜运来。这约柜就是坐在二基路伯上耶和华神留名的约柜。
{1Ch 13:7}  And they carried the ark of God on a new cart, from the house of Abinadab, and Uzzah and Ahio were driving the cart.
{1Ch 13:7}  他们将神的约柜从亚比拿达的家里抬出来，放在新车上。乌撒和亚希约赶车。
{1Ch 13:8}  And David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, with song and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets.
{1Ch 13:8}  大卫和以色列众人在神前用琴、瑟、锣、鼓、号作乐，极力跳舞歌唱。
{1Ch 13:9}  And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand to take hold of the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
{1Ch 13:9}  到了基顿（在撒母耳下六章六节是拿艮）的禾场；因为牛失前蹄（或作：惊跳），乌撒就伸手扶住约柜。
{1Ch 13:10} And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he put out his hand to the ark, and he died there before God.
{1Ch 13:10} 耶和华向他发怒，因他伸手扶住约柜击杀他，他就死在神面前。
{1Ch 13:11} And David was angry because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.
{1Ch 13:11} 大卫因耶和华击杀（原文作闯杀）乌撒，心里愁烦，就称那地方为毗列斯乌撒，直到今日。
{1Ch 13:12} And David was afraid of God that day, and he said, "How can I bring the ark of God home to me?"
{1Ch 13:12} 那日，大卫惧怕神，说：“神的约柜怎可运到我这里来？”
{1Ch 13:13} So David did not take the ark home into the city of David, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
{1Ch 13:13} 于是大卫不将约柜运进大卫的城，却运到迦特人俄别以东的家中。
{1Ch 13:14} And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that he had.
{1Ch 13:14} 神的约柜在俄别以东家中三个月，耶和华赐福给俄别以东的家和他一切所有的。

{1Ch 14:1}  推罗王希兰将香柏木运到大卫那里，又差遣使者和石匠、木匠给大卫建造宫殿。
{1Ch 14:2}  And David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
{1Ch 14:2}  大卫就知道耶和华坚立他作以色列王，又为自己的民以色列，使他的国兴旺。
{1Ch 14:3}  And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters.
{1Ch 14:3}  大卫在耶路撒冷又立后妃，又生儿女。
{1Ch 14:4}  These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,

{1Ch 14:8}  When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went out against them.
{1Ch 14:8}  非利士人听见大卫受膏作以色列众人的王，非利士众人就上来寻索大卫。大卫听见，就出去迎敌。
{1Ch 14:9}  Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim.
{1Ch 14:9}  非利士人来了，布散在利乏音谷。
{1Ch 14:10} And David inquired of God, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?" And the LORD said to him, "Go up, and I will give them into your hand."
{1Ch 14:10} 大卫求问神，说：“我可以上去攻打非利士人吗？你将他们交在我手里吗？”耶和华说：“你可以上去，我必将他们交在你手里。”
{1Ch 14:11} And he went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them down there. And David said, "God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood." Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim.
{1Ch 14:11} 非利士人来到巴力毗拉心，大卫在那里杀败他们。大卫说：“神藉我的手冲破敌人，如同水冲去一般”；因此称那地方为巴力毗拉心。
{1Ch 14:12} And they left their gods there, and David gave command, and they were burned.
{1Ch 14:12} 非利士人将神像撇在那里，大卫吩咐人用火焚烧了。
{1Ch 14:13} And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
{1Ch 14:13} 非利士人又布散在利乏音谷。
{1Ch 14:14} And when David again inquired of God, God said to him, "You shall not go up after them; go around and come against them opposite the balsam trees.
{1Ch 14:14} 大卫又求问神。神说：“不要一直地上去，要转到他们后头，从桑林对面攻打他们。
{1Ch 14:15} And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines."
{1Ch 14:15} 你听见桑树梢上有脚步的声音，就要出战，因为神已经在你前头去攻打非利士人的军队。”
{1Ch 14:16} And David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
{1Ch 14:16} 大卫就遵着神所吩咐的，攻打非利士人的军队，从基遍直到基色。
{1Ch 14:17} And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.
{1Ch 14:17} 于是大卫的名传扬到列国，耶和华使列国都惧怕他。
{1Ch 15:1}  David built houses for himself in the city of David. And he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
{1Ch 15:1}  大卫在大卫城为自己建造宫殿，又为神的约柜预备地方，支搭帐幕。
{1Ch 15:2}  Then David said that no one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the LORD had chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister to him forever.
{1Ch 15:2}  那时大卫说：“除了利未人之外，无人可抬神的约柜；因为耶和华拣选他们抬神的约柜，且永远事奉他。”
{1Ch 15:3}  And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it.
{1Ch 15:3}  大卫招聚以色列众人到耶路撒冷，要将耶和华的约柜抬到他所预备的地方。
{1Ch 15:4}  And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites:
{1Ch 15:4}  大卫又聚集亚伦的子孙和利未人。
{1Ch 15:5}  of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with 120 of his brothers;
{1Ch 15:5}  哥辖子孙中有族长乌列和他的弟兄一百二十人。
{1Ch 15:6}  of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with 220 of his brothers;
{1Ch 15:6}  米拉利子孙中有族长亚帅雅和他的弟兄二百二十人。
{1Ch 15:7}  of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with 130 of his brothers;
{1Ch 15:7}  革顺子孙中有族长约珥和他的弟兄一百三十人。
{1Ch 15:8}  of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with 200 of his brothers;
{1Ch 15:8}  以利撒反子孙中有族长示玛雅和他的弟兄二百人。
{1Ch 15:9}  of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with 80 of his brothers;
{1Ch 15:9}  希伯仑子孙中有族长以列和他的弟兄八十人。
{1Ch 15:10} of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with 112 of his brothers.
{1Ch 15:10} 乌薛子孙中有族长亚米拿达和他的弟兄一百一十二人。
{1Ch 15:11} Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,
{1Ch 15:11} 大卫将祭司撒督和亚比亚他，并利未人乌列、亚帅雅、约珥、示玛雅、以列、亚米拿达召来，
{1Ch 15:12} and said to them, "You are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites. Consecrate yourselves, you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.
{1Ch 15:12} 对他们说：“你们是利未人的族长，你们和你们的弟兄应当自洁，好将耶和华以色列神的约柜抬到我所预备的地方。
{1Ch 15:13} Because you did not carry it the first time, the LORD our God broke out against us, because we did not seek him according to the rule."
{1Ch 15:13} 因你们先前没有抬这约柜，按定例求问耶和华我们的神，所以他刑罚（原文作闯杀）我们。”
{1Ch 15:14} So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.
{1Ch 15:14} 于是祭司利未人自洁，好将耶和华以色列神的约柜抬上来。
{1Ch 15:15} And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD.
{1Ch 15:15} 利未子孙就用杠，肩抬神的约柜，是照耶和华藉摩西所吩咐的。
{1Ch 15:16} David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy.
{1Ch 15:16} 大卫吩咐利未人的族长，派他们歌唱的弟兄用琴瑟和钹作乐，欢欢喜喜地大声歌颂。
{1Ch 15:17} So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
{1Ch 15:17} 于是利未人派约珥的儿子希幔和他弟兄中比利家的儿子亚萨，并他们族弟兄米拉利子孙里古沙雅的儿子以探。
{1Ch 15:18} and with them their brothers of the second order, Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
{1Ch 15:18} 其次还有他们的弟兄撒迦利雅、便雅薛、示米拉末、耶歇、乌尼、以利押、比拿雅、玛西雅、玛他提雅、以利斐利户、弥克尼雅，并守门的俄别以东和耶利。
{1Ch 15:19} The singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals;
{1Ch 15:19} 这样，派歌唱的希幔、亚萨、以探敲铜钹，大发响声；
{1Ch 15:20} Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth;
{1Ch 15:20} 派撒迦利雅、雅薛、示米拉末、耶歇、乌尼、以利押、玛西雅、比拿雅鼓瑟，调用女音；
{1Ch 15:21} but Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith.
{1Ch 15:21} 又派玛他提雅、以利斐利户、弥克尼雅、俄别以东、耶利、亚撒西雅领首弹琴，调用第八。
{1Ch 15:22} Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, should direct the music, for he understood it.
{1Ch 15:22} 利未人的族长基拿尼雅是歌唱人的首领，又教训人歌唱，因为他精通此事。
{1Ch 15:23} Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
{1Ch 15:23} 比利家、以利加拿是约柜前守门的。
{1Ch 15:24} Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, should blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
{1Ch 15:24} 祭司示巴尼、约沙法、拿坦业、亚玛赛、撒迦利雅、比拿亚、以利以谢在神的约柜前吹号。俄别以东和耶希亚也是约柜前守门的。
{1Ch 15:25} So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing.
{1Ch 15:25} 于是，大卫和以色列的长老，并千夫长都去从俄别以东的家欢欢喜喜地将耶和华的约柜抬上来。
{1Ch 15:26} And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
{1Ch 15:26} 神赐恩与抬耶和华约柜的利未人，他们就献上七只公牛，七只公羊。
{1Ch 15:27} David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers. And David wore a linen ephod.
{1Ch 15:27} 大卫和抬约柜的利未人，并歌唱人的首领基拿尼雅，以及歌唱的人，都穿着细麻布的外袍；大卫另外穿着细麻布的以弗得。
{1Ch 15:28} So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, to the sound of the horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and made loud music on harps and lyres.
{1Ch 15:28} 这样，以色列众人欢呼吹角、吹号、敲钹、鼓瑟、弹琴，大发响声，将耶和华的约柜抬上来。
{1Ch 15:29} And as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.
{1Ch 15:29} 耶和华的约柜进了大卫城的时候，扫罗的女儿米甲从窗户里观看，见大卫王踊跃跳舞，心里就轻视他。
{1Ch 16:1}  And they brought in the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
{1Ch 16:1}  众人将神的约柜请进去，安放在大卫所搭的帐幕里，就在神面前献燔祭和平安祭。
{1Ch 16:2}  And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD
{1Ch 16:2}  大卫献完了燔祭和平安祭，就奉耶和华的名给民祝福，
{1Ch 16:3}  and distributed to all Israel, both men and women, to each a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.
{1Ch 16:3}  并且分给以色列人，无论男女，每人一个饼，一块肉，一个葡萄饼。
{1Ch 16:4}  Then he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the LORD, to invoke, to thank, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel.
{1Ch 16:4}  大卫派几个利未人在耶和华的约柜前事奉，颂扬，称谢，赞美耶和华以色列的神：
{1Ch 16:5}  Asaph was the chief, and second to him were Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, who were to play harps and lyres; Asaph was to sound the cymbals,
{1Ch 16:5}  为首的是亚萨，其次是撒迦利雅、雅薛、示米拉末、耶歇、玛他提雅、以利押、比拿雅、俄别以东、耶利，鼓瑟弹琴；惟有亚萨敲钹，大发响声；
{1Ch 16:6}  and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
{1Ch 16:6}  祭司比拿雅和雅哈悉常在神的约柜前吹号。
{1Ch 16:7}  Then on that day David first appointed that thanksgiving be sung to the LORD by Asaph and his brothers.
{1Ch 16:7}  那日，大卫初次藉亚萨和他的弟兄以诗歌称颂耶和华，说：
{1Ch 16:8}  Oh give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples!
{1Ch 16:8}  你们要称谢耶和华，求告他的名，在万民中传扬他的作为！
{1Ch 16:9}  Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works!
{1Ch 16:9}  要向他唱诗、歌颂，谈论他一切奇妙的作为。
{1Ch 16:10} Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!
{1Ch 16:10} 要以他的圣名夸耀；寻求耶和华的人，心中应当欢喜。
{1Ch 16:11} Seek the LORD and his strength; seek his presence continually!
{1Ch 16:11} 要寻求耶和华与他的能力，时常寻求他的面。
{1Ch 16:12} Remember the wondrous works that he has done, his miracles and the judgments he uttered,
{1Ch 16:12} (SEE 16:13)
{1Ch 16:13} O offspring of Israel his servant, children of Jacob, his chosen ones!
{1Ch 16:13} 他仆人以色列的后裔，他所拣选雅各的子孙哪，你们要记念他奇妙的作为和他的奇事，并他口中的判语。
{1Ch 16:14} He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
{1Ch 16:14} 他是耶和华我们的神，全地都有他的判断。
{1Ch 16:15} Remember his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
{1Ch 16:15} 你们要记念他的约，直到永远；他所吩咐的话，直到千代，
{1Ch 16:16} the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,
{1Ch 16:16} 就是与亚伯拉罕所立的约，向以撒所起的誓。
{1Ch 16:17} which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
{1Ch 16:17} 他又将这约向雅各定为律例，向以色列定为永远的约，
{1Ch 16:18} saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, as your portion for an inheritance."
{1Ch 16:18} 说：我必将迦南地赐给你，作你产业的分。
{1Ch 16:19} When you were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,
{1Ch 16:19} 当时你们人丁有限，数目稀少，并且在那地为寄居的；
{1Ch 16:20} wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,
{1Ch 16:20} 他们从这邦游到那邦，从这国行到那国。
{1Ch 16:21} he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,
{1Ch 16:21} 耶和华不容什么人欺负他们，为他们的缘故责备君王，
{1Ch 16:22} saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!"
{1Ch 16:22} 说：不可难为我受膏的人，也不可恶待我的先知！
{1Ch 16:23} Sing to the LORD, all the earth! Tell of his salvation from day to day.
{1Ch 16:23} 全地都要向耶和华歌唱！天天传扬他的救恩，
{1Ch 16:24} Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples!
{1Ch 16:24} 在列邦中述说他的荣耀，在万民中述说他的奇事。
{1Ch 16:25} For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised, and he is to be feared above all gods.
{1Ch 16:25} 因耶和华为大，当受极大的赞美；他在万神之上，当受敬畏。
{1Ch 16:26} For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the LORD made the heavens.
{1Ch 16:26} 外邦的神都属虚无，惟独耶和华创造诸天。
{1Ch 16:27} Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and joy are in his place.
{1Ch 16:27} 有尊荣和威严在他面前，有能力和喜乐在他圣所。
{1Ch 16:28} Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength!
{1Ch 16:28} 民中的万族啊，你们要将荣耀能力归给耶和华，都归给耶和华！
{1Ch 16:29} Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering and come before him! Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness;
{1Ch 16:29} 要将耶和华的名所当得的荣耀归给他，拿供物来奉到他面前；当以圣洁的（的：或作为）妆饰敬拜耶和华。
{1Ch 16:30} tremble before him, all the earth; yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved.
{1Ch 16:30} 全地要在他面前战抖，世界也坚定不得动摇。
{1Ch 16:31} Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice, and let them say among the nations, "The LORD reigns!"
{1Ch 16:31} 愿天欢喜，愿地快乐；愿人在列邦中说：耶和华作王了！
{1Ch 16:32} Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; let the field exult, and everything in it!
{1Ch 16:32} 愿海和其中所充满的澎湃；愿田和其中所有的都欢乐。
{1Ch 16:33} Then shall the trees of the forest sing for joy before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.
{1Ch 16:33} 那时，林中的树木都要在耶和华面前欢呼，因为他来要审判全地。
{1Ch 16:34} Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever!
{1Ch 16:34} 应当称谢耶和华；因他本为善，他的慈爱永远长存！
{1Ch 16:35} Say also: "Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather and deliver us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.
{1Ch 16:35} 要说：拯救我们的神啊，求你救我们，聚集我们，使我们脱离外邦，我们好称赞你的圣名，以赞美你为夸胜。
{1Ch 16:36} Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting!" Then all the people said, "Amen!" and praised the LORD.
{1Ch 16:36} 耶和华以色列的神，从亘古直到永远，是应当称颂的！众民都说：“阿们！”并且赞美耶和华。
{1Ch 16:37} So David left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister regularly before the ark as each day required,
{1Ch 16:37} 大卫派亚萨和他的弟兄在约柜前常常事奉耶和华，一日尽一日的职分；
{1Ch 16:38} and also Obed-edom and his sixty-eight brothers, while Obed-edom, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah were to be gatekeepers.
{1Ch 16:38} 又派俄别以东和他的弟兄六十八人，与耶杜顿的儿子俄别以东，并何萨作守门的；
{1Ch 16:39} And he left Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon
{1Ch 16:39} (SEE 16:40)
{1Ch 16:40} to offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly morning and evening, to do all that is written in the Law of the LORD that he commanded Israel.
{1Ch 16:40} 且派祭司撒督和他弟兄众祭司在基遍的邱坛、耶和华的帐幕前燔祭坛上，每日早晚，照着耶和华律法书上所吩咐以色列人的，常给耶和华献燔祭。
{1Ch 16:41} With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and expressly named to give thanks to the LORD, for his steadfast love endures forever.
{1Ch 16:41} 与他们一同被派的有希幔、耶杜顿，和其余被选名字录在册上的，称谢耶和华，因他的慈爱永远长存。
{1Ch 16:42} Heman and Jeduthun had trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were appointed to the gate.
{1Ch 16:42} 希幔、耶杜顿同着他们吹号、敲钹，大发响声，并用别的乐器随着歌颂神。耶杜顿的子孙作守门的。
{1Ch 16:43} Then all the people departed each to his house, and David went home to bless his household.
{1Ch 16:43} 于是众民各归各家；大卫也回去为家眷祝福。
{1Ch 17:1}  Now when David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, "Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent."
{1Ch 17:1}  大卫住在自己宫中，对先知拿单说：“看哪，我住在香柏木的宫中，耶和华的约柜反在幔子里。”
{1Ch 17:2}  And Nathan said to David, "Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you."
{1Ch 17:2}  拿单对大卫说：“你可以照你的心意而行，因为神与你同在。”
{1Ch 17:3}  But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan,
{1Ch 17:3}  当夜，神的话临到拿单，说：
{1Ch 17:4}  "Go and tell my servant David, 'Thus says the LORD: It is not you who will build me a house to dwell in.
{1Ch 17:4}  “你去告诉我仆人大卫，说耶和华如此说：‘你不可建造殿宇给我居住。
{1Ch 17:5}  For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from dwelling to dwelling.
{1Ch 17:5}  自从我领以色列人出埃及，直到今日，我未曾住过殿宇，乃从这会幕到那会幕，从这帐幕到那帐幕。
{1Ch 17:6}  In all places where I have moved with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'
{1Ch 17:6}  凡我同以色列人所走的地方，我何曾向以色列的一个士师，就是我吩咐牧养我民的说：你为何不给我建造香柏木的殿宇呢？’
{1Ch 17:7}  Now, therefore, thus shall you say to my servant David, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel,
{1Ch 17:7}  现在你要告诉我仆人大卫，说万军之耶和华如此说：‘我从羊圈中将你召来，叫你不再跟从羊群，立你作我民以色列的君。
{1Ch 17:8}  and I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
{1Ch 17:8}  你无论往那里去，我常与你同在，剪除你的一切仇敌；我必使你得大名，好像世上大大有名的人一样。
{1Ch 17:9}  And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall waste them no more, as formerly,
{1Ch 17:9}  我必为我民以色列选定一个地方，栽培他们，使他们住自己的地方，不再迁移；凶恶之子也不像从前扰害他们，
{1Ch 17:10} from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house.
{1Ch 17:10} 并不像我命士师治理我民以色列的时候一样。我必治服你的一切仇敌，并且我耶和华应许你，必为你建立家室。
{1Ch 17:11} When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
{1Ch 17:11} 你寿数满足归你列祖的时候，我必使你的后裔接续你的位，我也必坚定他的国。
{1Ch 17:12} He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.
{1Ch 17:12} 他必为我建造殿宇；我必坚定他的国位直到永远。
{1Ch 17:13} I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you,
{1Ch 17:13} 我要作他的父，他要作我的子；并不使我的慈爱离开他，像离开在你以前的扫罗一样。
{1Ch 17:14} but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.'"
{1Ch 17:14} 我却要将他永远坚立在我家里和我国里；他的国位也必坚定，直到永远。’”
{1Ch 17:15} In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
{1Ch 17:15} 拿单就按这一切话，照这默示告诉大卫。
{1Ch 17:16} Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said, "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
{1Ch 17:16} 于是大卫王进去，坐在耶和华面前，说：“耶和华神啊，我是谁，我的家算什么，你竟使我到这地步呢？
{1Ch 17:17} And this was a small thing in your eyes, O God. You have also spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, O LORD God!
{1Ch 17:17} 神啊，这在你眼中还看为小，又应许你仆人的家至于久远。耶和华神啊，你看顾我好像看顾高贵的人。
{1Ch 17:18} And what more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant.
{1Ch 17:18} 你加于仆人的尊荣，我还有何言可说呢？因为你知道你的仆人。
{1Ch 17:19} For your servant's sake, O LORD, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.
{1Ch 17:19} 耶和华啊，你行了这大事，并且显明出来，是因你仆人的缘故，也是照你的心意。
{1Ch 17:20} There is none like you, O LORD, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
{1Ch 17:20} 耶和华啊，照我们耳中听见，没有可比你的，除你以外再无神。
{1Ch 17:21} And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making for yourself a name for great and awesome things, in driving out nations before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt?
{1Ch 17:21} 世上有何民能比你的民以色列呢？你神从埃及救赎他们作自己的子民，又在你赎出来的民面前行大而可畏的事，驱逐列邦人，显出你的大名。
{1Ch 17:22} And you made your people Israel to be your people forever, and you, O LORD, became their God.
{1Ch 17:22} 你使以色列人作你的子民，直到永远；你耶和华也作他们的神。
{1Ch 17:23} And now, O LORD, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as you have spoken,
{1Ch 17:23} 耶和华啊，你所应许仆人和仆人家的话，求你坚定，直到永远，照你所说的而行。
{1Ch 17:24} and your name will be established and magnified forever, saying, 'The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel's God,' and the house of your servant David will be established before you.
{1Ch 17:24} 愿你的名永远坚立，被尊为大，说：‘万军之耶和华是以色列的神，是治理以色列的神。’这样，你仆人大卫的家必在你面前坚立。
{1Ch 17:25} For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.
{1Ch 17:25} 我的神啊，因你启示仆人说，我必为你建立家室，所以仆人大胆在你面前祈祷。
{1Ch 17:26} And now, O LORD, you are God, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.
{1Ch 17:26} 耶和华啊，惟有你是神，你也应许将这福气赐给仆人。
{1Ch 17:27} Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you, for it is you, O LORD, who have blessed, and it is blessed forever."
{1Ch 17:27} 现在你喜悦赐福与仆人的家，可以永存在你面前。耶和华啊，你已经赐福，还要赐福到永远。”
{1Ch 18:1}  After this David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Gath and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines.
{1Ch 18:1}  此后，大卫攻打非利士人，把他们治服，从他们手下夺取了迦特和属迦特的村庄；
{1Ch 18:2}  And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.
{1Ch 18:2}  又攻打摩押，摩押人就归服大卫，给他进贡。
{1Ch 18:3}  David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah-Hamath, as he went to set up his monument at the river Euphrates.
{1Ch 18:3}  琐巴王哈大利谢（在撒母耳下八章三节是哈大底谢）往伯拉大河去，要坚定自己的国权，大卫就攻打他，直到哈马，
{1Ch 18:4}  And David took from him 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left enough for 100 chariots.
{1Ch 18:4}  夺了他的战车一千，马兵七千，步兵二万，将拉战车的马砍断蹄筋，但留下一百辆车的马。
{1Ch 18:5}  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 men of the Syrians.
{1Ch 18:5}  大马色的亚兰人来帮助琐巴王哈大利谢，大卫就杀了亚兰人二万二千。
{1Ch 18:6}  Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
{1Ch 18:6}  于是大卫在大马色的亚兰地设立防营，亚兰人就归服他，给他进贡。大卫无论往那里去，耶和华都使他得胜。
{1Ch 18:7}  And David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
{1Ch 18:7}  他夺了哈大利谢臣仆所拿的金盾牌带到耶路撒冷。
{1Ch 18:8}  And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze. With it Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze.
{1Ch 18:8}  大卫又从属哈大利谢的提巴（或作：比他）和均二城中夺取了许多的铜。后来所罗门用此制造铜海、铜柱，和一切的铜器。
{1Ch 18:9}  When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer, king of Zobah,
{1Ch 18:9}  哈马王陀乌听见大卫杀败琐巴王哈大利谢的全军，
{1Ch 18:10} he sent his son Hadoram to King David, to ask about his health and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had often been at war with Tou. And he sent all sorts of articles of gold, of silver, and of bronze.
{1Ch 18:10} 就打发他儿子哈多兰去见大卫王，问他的安，为他祝福，因为他杀败了哈大利谢（原来陀乌与哈大利谢常常争战）。哈多兰带了金银铜的各样器皿来。
{1Ch 18:11} These also King David dedicated to the LORD, together with the silver and gold that he had carried off from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.
{1Ch 18:11} 大卫王将这些器皿，并从各国夺来的金银，就是从以东、摩押、亚扪、非利士、亚玛力人所夺来的，都分别为圣献给耶和华。
{1Ch 18:12} And Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, killed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
{1Ch 18:12} 洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛在盐谷击杀了以东一万八千人。
{1Ch 18:13} Then he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's servants. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
{1Ch 18:13} 大卫在以东地设立防营，以东人就都归服他。大卫无论往那里去，耶和华都使他得胜。
{1Ch 18:14} So David reigned over all Israel, and he administered justice and equity to all his people.
{1Ch 18:14} 大卫作以色列众人的王，又向众民秉公行义。
{1Ch 18:15} And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
{1Ch 18:15} 洗鲁雅的儿子约押作元帅；亚希律的儿子约沙法作史官；
{1Ch 18:16} and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests; and Shavsha was secretary;
{1Ch 18:16} 亚希突的儿子撒督和亚比亚他的儿子亚希米勒作祭司长；沙威沙作书记；
{1Ch 18:17} and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were the chief officials in the service of the king.
{1Ch 18:17} 耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅统辖基利提人和比利提人。大卫的众子都在王的左右作领袖。
{1Ch 19:1}  Now after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his place.
{1Ch 19:1}  此后，亚扪人的王拿辖死了，他儿子接续他作王。
{1Ch 19:2}  And David said, "I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father dealt kindly with me." So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came to the land of the Ammonites to Hanun to console him.
{1Ch 19:2}  大卫说：“我要照哈嫩的父亲拿辖厚待我的恩典厚待哈嫩。”于是大卫差遣使者为他丧父安慰他。大卫的臣仆到了亚扪人的境内见哈嫩，要安慰他，
{1Ch 19:3}  But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, "Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?"
{1Ch 19:3}  但亚扪人的首领对哈嫩说：“大卫差人来安慰你，你想他是尊敬你父亲吗？他的臣仆来见你不是为详察窥探、倾覆这地吗？”
{1Ch 19:4}  So Hanun took David's servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away;
{1Ch 19:4}  哈嫩便将大卫臣仆的胡须剃去一半，又割断他们下半截的衣服，使他们露出下体，打发他们回去。
{1Ch 19:5}  and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, "Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return."
{1Ch 19:5}  有人将臣仆所遇的事告诉大卫，他就差人去迎接他们，因为他们甚觉羞耻；告诉他们说：“可以住在耶利哥，等到胡须长起再回来。”
{1Ch 19:6}  When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from Zobah.
{1Ch 19:6}  亚扪人知道大卫憎恶他们，哈嫩和亚扪人就打发人拿一千他连得银子，从美索不达米亚、亚兰、玛迦、琐巴雇战车和马兵，
{1Ch 19:7}  They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle.
{1Ch 19:7}  于是雇了三万二千辆战车和玛迦王并他的军兵；他们来安营在米底巴前。亚扪人也从他们的城里出来，聚集交战。
{1Ch 19:8}  When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.
{1Ch 19:8}  大卫听见了，就差派约押统带勇猛的全军出去。
{1Ch 19:9}  And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
{1Ch 19:9}  亚扪人出来在城门前摆阵，所来的诸王另在郊野摆阵。
{1Ch 19:10} When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians.
{1Ch 19:10} 约押看见敌人在他前后摆阵，就从以色列军中挑选精兵，使他们对着亚兰人摆阵；
{1Ch 19:11} The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites.
{1Ch 19:11} 其余的兵交与他兄弟亚比筛，对着亚扪人摆阵。
{1Ch 19:12} And he said, "If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you.
{1Ch 19:12} 约押对亚比筛说：“亚兰人若强过我，你就来帮助我；亚扪人若强过你，我就去帮助你。
{1Ch 19:13} Be strong, and let us use our strength for our people and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good to him."
{1Ch 19:13} 我们都当刚强，为本国的民和神的城邑作大丈夫，愿耶和华凭他的意旨而行。”
{1Ch 19:14} So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle, and they fled before him.
{1Ch 19:14} 于是约押和跟随他的人前进攻打亚兰人；亚兰人在约押面前逃跑。
{1Ch 19:15} And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, Joab's brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
{1Ch 19:15} 亚扪人见亚兰人逃跑，他们也在约押的兄弟亚比筛面前逃跑进城。约押就回耶路撒冷去了。
{1Ch 19:16} But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
{1Ch 19:16} 亚兰人见自己被以色列人打败，就打发使者将大河那边的亚兰人调来，哈大利谢的将军朔法率领他们。
{1Ch 19:17} And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
{1Ch 19:17} 有人告诉大卫，他就聚集以色列众人过约但河，来到亚兰人那里，迎着他们摆阵。大卫既摆阵攻击亚兰人，亚兰人就与他打仗。
{1Ch 19:18} And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 7,000 chariots and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death also Shophach the commander of their army.
{1Ch 19:18} 亚兰人在以色列人面前逃跑。大卫杀了亚兰七千辆战车的人，四万步兵，又杀了亚兰的将军朔法。
{1Ch 19:19} And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Syrians were not willing to save the Ammonites anymore.
{1Ch 19:19} 属哈大利谢的诸王见自己被以色列人打败，就与大卫和好，归服他。于是亚兰人不敢再帮助亚扪人了。
{1Ch 20:1}  In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led out the army and ravaged the country of the Ammonites and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. And Joab struck down Rabbah and overthrew it.
{1Ch 20:1}  过了一年，到列王出战的时候，约押率领军兵毁坏亚扪人的地，围攻拉巴；大卫仍住在耶路撒冷。约押攻打拉巴，将城倾覆。
{1Ch 20:2}  And David took the crown of their king from his head. He found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone. And it was placed on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
{1Ch 20:2}  大卫夺了亚扪人之王所戴的金冠冕（王：或作玛勒堪。玛勒堪即米勒公，是亚扪族之神名），其上的金子重一他连得，又嵌着宝石；人将这冠冕戴在大卫头上。大卫从城里夺了许多财物，
{1Ch 20:3}  And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and axes. And thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
{1Ch 20:3}  将城里的人拉出来，放在锯下，或铁耙下，或铁斧下（或作：强他们用锯，或用打粮食的铁器，或用铁斧做工），大卫待亚扪各城的居民都是如此。其后大卫和众军都回耶路撒冷去了。
{1Ch 20:4}  And after this there arose war with the Philistines at Gezer. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the giants, and the Philistines were subdued.
{1Ch 20:4}  后来，以色列人在基色与非利士人打仗。户沙人西比该杀了伟人的一个儿子细派，非利士人就被制伏了。
{1Ch 20:5}  And there was again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair struck down Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
{1Ch 20:5}  又与非利士人打仗。睚珥的儿子伊勒哈难杀了迦特人歌利亚的兄弟拉哈米；这人的枪杆粗如织布的机轴。
{1Ch 20:6}  And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the giants.
{1Ch 20:6}  又在迦特打仗。那里有一个身量高大的人，手脚都是六指，共有二十四个指头，他也是伟人的儿子。
{1Ch 20:7}  And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, struck him down.
{1Ch 20:7}  这人向以色列人骂阵，大卫的哥哥示米亚的儿子约拿单就杀了他。
{1Ch 20:8}  These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
{1Ch 20:8}  这三个人是迦特伟人的儿子，都死在大卫和他仆人的手下。
{1Ch 21:1}  Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel.
{1Ch 21:1}  撒但起来攻击以色列人，激动大卫数点他们。
{1Ch 21:2}  So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, "Go, number Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number."
{1Ch 21:2}  大卫就吩咐约押和民中的首领说：“你们去数点以色列人，从别是巴直到但，回来告诉我，我好知道他们的数目。”
{1Ch 21:3}  But Joab said, "May the LORD add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord's servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should it be a cause of guilt for Israel?"
{1Ch 21:3}  约押说：“愿耶和华使他的百姓比现在加增百倍。我主我王啊，他们不都是你的仆人吗？我主为何吩咐行这事，为何使以色列人陷在罪里呢？”
{1Ch 21:4}  But the king's word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came back to Jerusalem.
{1Ch 21:4}  但王的命令胜过约押。约押就出去，走遍以色列地，回到耶路撒冷，
{1Ch 21:5}  And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and in Judah 470,000 who drew the sword.
{1Ch 21:5}  将百姓的总数奏告大卫：以色列人拿刀的有一百一十万；犹大人拿刀的有四十七万。
{1Ch 21:6}  But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king's command was abhorrent to Joab.
{1Ch 21:6}  惟有利未人和便雅悯人没有数在其中，因为约押厌恶王的这命令。
{1Ch 21:7}  But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel.
{1Ch 21:7}  神不喜悦这数点百姓的事，便降灾给以色列人。
{1Ch 21:8}  And David said to God, "I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly."
{1Ch 21:8}  大卫祷告神说：“我行这事大有罪了！现在求你除掉仆人的罪孽，因我所行的甚是愚昧。”
{1Ch 21:9}  And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
{1Ch 21:9}  耶和华吩咐大卫的先见迦得说：
{1Ch 21:10} "Go and say to David, 'Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.'"
{1Ch 21:10} “你去告诉大卫说，耶和华如此说：我有三样灾，随你选择一样，我好降与你。”
{1Ch 21:11} So Gad came to David and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Choose what you will:
{1Ch 21:11} 于是，迦得来见大卫，对他说：“耶和华如此说：‘你可以随意选择：
{1Ch 21:12} either three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword of the LORD, pestilence on the land, with the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.' Now decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me."
{1Ch 21:12} 或三年的饥荒；或败在你敌人面前，被敌人的刀追杀三个月；或在你国中有耶和华的刀，就是三日的瘟疫，耶和华的使者在以色列的四境施行毁灭。’现在你要想一想，我好回覆那差我来的。”
{1Ch 21:13} Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress. Let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man."
{1Ch 21:13} 大卫对迦得说：“我甚为难。我愿落在耶和华的手里，因为他有丰盛的怜悯；我不愿落在人的手里。”
{1Ch 21:14} So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell.
{1Ch 21:14} 于是，耶和华降瘟疫与以色列人，以色列人就死了七万。
{1Ch 21:15} And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw, and he relented from the calamity. And he said to the angel who was working destruction, "It is enough; now stay your hand." And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
{1Ch 21:15} 神差遣使者去灭耶路撒冷，刚要灭的时候，耶和华看见后悔，就不降这灾了，吩咐灭城的天使说：“够了，住手吧！”那时，耶和华的使者站在耶布斯人阿珥楠的禾场那里。
{1Ch 21:16} And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
{1Ch 21:16} 大卫举目，看见耶和华的使者站在天地间，手里有拔出来的刀，伸在耶路撒冷以上。大卫和长老都身穿麻衣，面伏于地。
{1Ch 21:17} And David said to God, "Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O LORD my God, be against me and against my father's house. But do not let the plague be on your people."
{1Ch 21:17} 大卫祷告神说：“吩咐数点百姓的不是我吗？我犯了罪，行了恶，但这群羊做了什么呢？愿耶和华我神的手攻击我和我的父家，不要攻击你的民，降瘟疫与他们。”
{1Ch 21:18} Now the angel of the LORD had commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
{1Ch 21:18} 耶和华的使者吩咐迦得去告诉大卫，叫他上去，在耶布斯人阿珥楠的禾场上为耶和华筑一座坛；
{1Ch 21:19} So David went up at Gad's word, which he had spoken in the name of the LORD.
{1Ch 21:19} 大卫就照着迦得奉耶和华名所说的话上去了。
{1Ch 21:20} Now Ornan was threshing wheat. He turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
{1Ch 21:20} 那时阿珥楠正打麦子，回头看见天使，就和他四个儿子都藏起来了。
{1Ch 21:21} As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground.
{1Ch 21:21} 大卫到了阿珥楠那里，阿珥楠看见大卫，就从禾场上出去，脸伏于地，向他下拜。
{1Ch 21:22} And David said to Ornan, "Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the LORD--give it to me at its full price--that the plague may be averted from the people."
{1Ch 21:22} 大卫对阿珥楠说：“你将这禾场与相连之地卖给我，我必给你足价，我好在其上为耶和华筑一座坛，使民间的瘟疫止住。”
{1Ch 21:23} Then Ornan said to David, "Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all."
{1Ch 21:23} 阿珥楠对大卫说：“你可以用这禾场，愿我主我王照你所喜悦的去行。我也将牛给你作燔祭，把打粮的器具当柴烧，拿麦子作素祭。这些我都送给你。”
{1Ch 21:24} But King David said to Ornan, "No, but I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing."
{1Ch 21:24} 大卫王对阿珥楠说：“不然！我必要用足价向你买。我不用你的物献给耶和华，也不用白得之物献为燔祭。”
{1Ch 21:25} So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site.
{1Ch 21:25} 于是大卫为那块地平了六百舍客勒金子给阿珥楠。
{1Ch 21:26} And David built there an altar to the LORD and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.
{1Ch 21:26} 大卫在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛，献燔祭和平安祭，求告耶和华。耶和华就应允他，使火从天降在燔祭坛上。
{1Ch 21:27} Then the LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
{1Ch 21:27} 耶和华吩咐使者，他就收刀入鞘。
{1Ch 21:28} At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.
{1Ch 21:28} 那时，大卫见耶和华在耶布斯人阿珥楠的禾场上应允了他，就在那里献祭。
{1Ch 21:29} For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon,
{1Ch 21:29} 摩西在旷野所造之耶和华的帐幕和燔祭坛都在基遍的高处；
{1Ch 21:30} but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
{1Ch 21:30} 只是大卫不敢前去求问神，因为惧怕耶和华使者的刀。
{1Ch 22:1}  Then David said, "Here shall be the house of the LORD God and here the altar of burnt offering for Israel."
{1Ch 22:1}  大卫说：“这就是耶和华神的殿，为以色列人献燔祭的坛。”
{1Ch 22:2}  David commanded to gather together the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the house of God.
{1Ch 22:2}  大卫吩咐聚集住以色列地的外邦人，从其中派石匠凿石头，要建造神的殿。
{1Ch 22:3}  David also provided great quantities of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing,
{1Ch 22:3}  大卫预备许多铁做门上的钉子和钩子，又预备许多铜，多得无法可称；
{1Ch 22:4}  and cedar timbers without number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar to David.
{1Ch 22:4}  又预备无数的香柏木，因为西顿人和推罗人给大卫运了许多香柏木来。
{1Ch 22:5}  For David said, "Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and glory throughout all lands. I will therefore make preparation for it." So David provided materials in great quantity before his death.
{1Ch 22:5}  大卫说：“我儿子所罗门还年幼娇嫩，要为耶和华建造的殿宇必须高大辉煌，使名誉荣耀传遍万国；所以我要为殿预备材料。”于是，大卫在未死之先预备的材料甚多。
{1Ch 22:6}  Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.
{1Ch 22:6}  大卫召了他儿子所罗门来，嘱咐他给耶和华以色列的神建造殿宇，
{1Ch 22:7}  David said to Solomon, "My son, I had it in my heart to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.
{1Ch 22:7}  对所罗门说：“我儿啊，我心里本想为耶和华我神的名建造殿宇，
{1Ch 22:8}  But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'You have shed much blood and have waged great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed so much blood before me on the earth.
{1Ch 22:8}  只是耶和华的话临到我说：‘你流了多人的血，打了多次大仗，你不可为我的名建造殿宇，因为你在我眼前使多人的血流在地上。
{1Ch 22:9}  Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies. For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
{1Ch 22:9}  你要生一个儿子，他必作太平的人；我必使他安静，不被四围的仇敌扰乱。他的名要叫所罗门（就是太平的意思）。他在位的日子，我必使以色列人平安康泰。
{1Ch 22:10} He shall build a house for my name. He shall be my son, and I will be his father, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel forever.'
{1Ch 22:10} 他必为我的名建造殿宇。他要作我的子；我要作他的父。他作以色列王；我必坚定他的国位，直到永远。’
{1Ch 22:11} "Now, my son, the LORD be with you, so that you may succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as he has spoken concerning you.
{1Ch 22:11} 我儿啊，现今愿耶和华与你同在，使你亨通，照他指着你说的话，建造耶和华你神的殿。
{1Ch 22:12} Only, may the LORD grant you discretion and understanding, that when he gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
{1Ch 22:12} 但愿耶和华赐你聪明智慧，好治理以色列国，遵行耶和华你神的律法。
{1Ch 22:13} Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the rules that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Fear not; do not be dismayed.
{1Ch 22:13} 你若谨守遵行耶和华藉摩西吩咐以色列的律例典章，就得亨通。你当刚强壮胆，不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。
{1Ch 22:14} With great pains I have provided for the house of the LORD 100,000 talents of gold, a million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weighing, for there is so much of it; timber and stone, too, I have provided. To these you must add.
{1Ch 22:14} 我在困难之中为耶和华的殿预备了金子十万他连得，银子一百万他连得，铜和铁多得无法可称；我也预备了木头、石头，你还可以增添。
{1Ch 22:15} You have an abundance of workmen: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and all kinds of craftsmen without number, skilled in working
{1Ch 22:15} 你有许多匠人，就是石匠、木匠，和一切能做各样工的巧匠，
{1Ch 22:16} gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Arise and work! The LORD be with you!"
{1Ch 22:16} 并有无数的金银铜铁。你当起来办事，愿耶和华与你同在。”
{1Ch 22:17} David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
{1Ch 22:17} 大卫又吩咐以色列的众首领帮助他儿子所罗门，说：
{1Ch 22:18} "Is not the LORD your God with you? And has he not given you peace on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the LORD and his people.
{1Ch 22:18} “耶和华你们的神不是与你们同在吗？不是叫你们四围都平安吗？因他已将这地的居民交在我手中，这地就在耶和华与他百姓面前制伏了。
{1Ch 22:19} Now set your mind and heart to seek the LORD your God. Arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built for the name of the LORD."
{1Ch 22:19} 现在你们应当立定心意，寻求耶和华你们的神；也当起来建造耶和华神的圣所，好将耶和华的约柜和供奉神的圣器皿都搬进为耶和华名建造的殿里。”
{1Ch 23:1}  When David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
{1Ch 23:1}  大卫年纪老迈，日子满足，就立他儿子所罗门作以色列的王。
{1Ch 23:2}  David assembled all the leaders of Israel and the priests and the Levites.
{1Ch 23:2}  大卫招聚以色列的众首领和祭司利未人。
{1Ch 23:3}  The Levites, thirty years old and upward, were numbered, and the total was 38,000 men.
{1Ch 23:3}  利未人从三十岁以外的都被数点，他们男丁的数目共有三万八千；
{1Ch 23:4}  "Twenty-four thousand of these," David said, "shall have charge of the work in the house of the LORD, 6,000 shall be officers and judges,
{1Ch 23:4}  其中有二万四千人管理耶和华殿的事，有六千人作官长和士师，
{1Ch 23:5}  4,000 gatekeepers, and 4,000 shall offer praises to the LORD with the instruments that I have made for praise."
{1Ch 23:5}  有四千人作守门的，又有四千人用大卫所做的乐器颂赞耶和华。
{1Ch 23:6}  And David organized them in divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

{1Ch 23:10} 示每的儿子是雅哈、细拿、耶乌施、比利亚共四人。
{1Ch 23:11} Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, therefore they became counted as a single father's house.
{1Ch 23:11} 雅哈是长子，细撒是次子。但耶乌施和比利亚的子孙不多，所以算为一族。
{1Ch 23:12} The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
{1Ch 23:12} 哥辖的儿子是暗兰、以斯哈、希伯伦、乌薛共四人。
{1Ch 23:13} The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to dedicate the most holy things, that he and his sons forever should make offerings before the LORD and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name forever.
{1Ch 23:13} 暗兰的儿子是亚伦、摩西。亚伦和他的子孙分出来，好分别至圣的物，在耶和华面前烧香、事奉他，奉他的名祝福，直到永远。
{1Ch 23:14} But the sons of Moses the man of God were named among the tribe of Levi.

{1Ch 23:24} 以上利未子孙作族长的，照着男丁的数目，从二十岁以外，都办耶和华殿的事务。
{1Ch 23:25} For David said, "The LORD, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people, and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.
{1Ch 23:25} 大卫说：“耶和华以色列的神已经使他的百姓平安，他永远住在耶路撒冷。
{1Ch 23:26} And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service."
{1Ch 23:26} 利未人不必再抬帐幕和其中所用的一切器皿了。”
{1Ch 23:27} For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward.
{1Ch 23:27} 照着大卫临终所吩咐的，利未人从二十岁以外的都被数点。
{1Ch 23:28} For their duty was to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, having the care of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of God.
{1Ch 23:28} 他们的职任是服事亚伦的子孙，在耶和华的殿和院子，并屋中办事，洁净一切圣物，就是办神殿的事务，
{1Ch 23:29} Their duty was also to assist with the showbread, the flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed with oil, and all measures of quantity or size.
{1Ch 23:29} 并管理陈设饼，素祭的细面，或无酵薄饼，或用盘烤，或用油调和的物，又管理各样的升斗尺度；
{1Ch 23:30} And they were to stand every morning, thanking and praising the LORD, and likewise at evening,
{1Ch 23:30} 每日早晚，站立称谢赞美耶和华，
{1Ch 23:31} and whenever burnt offerings were offered to the LORD on Sabbaths, new moons, and feast days, according to the number required of them, regularly before the LORD.
{1Ch 23:31} 又在安息日、月朔，并节期，按数照例，将燔祭常常献给耶和华；
{1Ch 23:32} Thus they were to keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary, and to attend the sons of Aaron, their brothers, for the service of the house of the LORD.
{1Ch 23:32} 又看守会幕和圣所，并守耶和华吩咐他们弟兄亚伦子孙的，办耶和华殿的事。
{1Ch 24:1}  The divisions of the sons of Aaron were these. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
{1Ch 24:1}  亚伦子孙的班次记在下面：亚伦的儿子是拿答、亚比户、以利亚撒、以他玛。
{1Ch 24:2}  But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar became the priests.
{1Ch 24:2}  拿答、亚比户死在他们父亲之先，没有留下儿子；故此，以利亚撒、以他玛供祭司的职分。
{1Ch 24:3}  With the help of Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service.
{1Ch 24:3}  以利亚撒的子孙撒督和以他玛的子孙亚希米勒，同着大卫将他们的族弟兄分成班次。
{1Ch 24:4}  Since more chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar, they organized them under sixteen heads of fathers' houses of the sons of Eleazar, and eight of the sons of Ithamar.
{1Ch 24:4}  以利亚撒子孙中为首的比以他玛子孙中为首的更多，分班如下：以利亚撒的子孙中有十六个族长，以他玛的子孙中有八个族长；
{1Ch 24:5}  They divided them by lot, all alike, for there were sacred officers and officers of God among both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar.
{1Ch 24:5}  都掣签分立，彼此一样。在圣所和神面前作首领的有以利亚撒的子孙，也有以他玛的子孙。
{1Ch 24:6}  And the scribe Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded them in the presence of the king and the princes and Zadok the priest and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar and the heads of the fathers' houses of the priests and of the Levites, one father's house being chosen for Eleazar and one chosen for Ithamar.

{1Ch 28:3}  只是神对我说：‘你不可为我的名建造殿宇；因你是战士，流了人的血。’
{1Ch 28:4}  Yet the LORD God of Israel chose me from all my father's house to be king over Israel forever. For he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah my father's house, and among my father's sons he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.
{1Ch 28:4}  然而，耶和华以色列的神在我父的全家拣选我作以色列的王，直到永远。因他拣选犹大为首领；在犹大支派中拣选我父家，在我父的众子里喜悦我，立我作以色列众人的王。
{1Ch 28:5}  And of all my sons (for the LORD has given me many sons) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.

{1Ch 28:8}  现今在耶和华的会中，以色列众人眼前所说的，我们的神也听见了。你们应当寻求耶和华你们神的一切诫命，谨守遵行，如此你们可以承受这美地，遗留给你们的子孙，永远为业。
{1Ch 28:9}  "And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.
{1Ch 28:9}  “我儿所罗门哪，你当认识耶和华你父的神，诚心乐意地事奉他；因为他鉴察众人的心，知道一切心思意念。你若寻求他，他必使你寻见；你若离弃他，他必永远丢弃你。

{1Ch 28:12} 又将被灵感动所得的样式，就是耶和华神殿的院子、周围的房屋、殿的府库，和圣物府库的一切样式都指示他；
{1Ch 28:13} for the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, and all the work of the service in the house of the LORD; for all the vessels for the service in the house of the LORD,
{1Ch 28:13} 又指示他祭司和利未人的班次与耶和华殿里各样的工作，并耶和华殿里一切器皿的样式，

{1Ch 28:18} for the altar of incense made of refined gold, and its weight; also his plan for the golden chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
{1Ch 28:18} 精金香坛的分两，并用金子做基路伯（原文作用金子做车式的基路伯）；基路伯张开翅膀，遮掩耶和华的约柜。
{1Ch 28:19} "All this he made clear to me in writing from the hand of the LORD, all the work to be done according to the plan."
{1Ch 28:19} 大卫说：“这一切工作的样式都是耶和华用手划出来使我明白的。”
{1Ch 28:20} Then David said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and courageous and do it. Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for the LORD God, even my God, is with you. He will not leave you or forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished.
{1Ch 28:20} 大卫又对他儿子所罗门说：“你当刚强壮胆去行！不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。因为耶和华神就是我的神，与你同在；他必不撇下你，也不丢弃你，直到耶和华殿的工作都完毕了。
{1Ch 28:21} And behold the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be every willing man who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command."
{1Ch 28:21} 有祭司和利未人的各班，为要办理神殿各样的事，又有灵巧的人在各样的工作上乐意帮助你；并有众首领和众民一心听从你的命令。”
{1Ch 29:1}  And David the king said to all the assembly, "Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the palace will not be for man but for the LORD God.
{1Ch 29:1}  大卫王对会众说：“我儿子所罗门是神特选的，还年幼娇嫩；这工程甚大，因这殿不是为人，乃是为耶和华神建造的。
{1Ch 29:2}  So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones and marble.

{1Ch 29:3}  Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God:
{1Ch 29:3}  且因我心中爱慕我神的殿，就在预备建造圣殿的材料之外，又将我自己积蓄的金银献上，建造我神的殿，
{1Ch 29:4}  3,000 talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house,
{1Ch 29:4}  就是俄斐金三千他连得、精链的银子七千他连得，以贴殿墙。
{1Ch 29:5}  and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to the LORD?"
{1Ch 29:5}  金子做金器，银子做银器，并藉匠人的手制造一切。今日有谁乐意将自己献给耶和华呢？”
{1Ch 29:6}  Then the leaders of fathers' houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king's work.
{1Ch 29:6}  于是，众族长和以色列各支派的首领、千夫长、百夫长，并监管王工的官长，都乐意献上。
