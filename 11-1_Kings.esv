{1Ki 1:1}   Now King David was old and advanced in years. And although they covered him with clothes, he could not get warm.
{1Ki 1:1}   大卫王年纪老迈，虽用被遮盖，仍不觉暖。
{1Ki 1:2}   Therefore his servants said to him, "Let a young woman be sought for my lord the king, and let her wait on the king and be in his service. Let her lie in your arms, that my lord the king may be warm."
{1Ki 1:2}   所以臣仆对他说：“不如为我主我王寻找一个处女，使他伺候王，奉养王，睡在王的怀中，好叫我主我王得暖。”
{1Ki 1:3}   So they sought for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
{1Ki 1:3}   于是在以色列全境寻找美貌的童女，寻得书念的一个童女亚比煞，就带到王那里。
{1Ki 1:4}   The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not.
{1Ki 1:4}   这童女极其美貌，他奉养王，伺候王，王却没有与他亲近。
{1Ki 1:5}   Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, "I will be king." And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
{1Ki 1:5}   那时，哈及的儿子亚多尼雅自尊，说：“我必作王”，就为自己预备车辆、马兵，又派五十人在他前头奔走。
{1Ki 1:6}   His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, "Why have you done thus and so?" He was also a very handsome man, and he was born next after Absalom.
{1Ki 1:6}   他父亲素来没有使他忧闷，说：“你是做什么呢？”他甚俊美，生在押沙龙之后。
{1Ki 1:7}   He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest. And they followed Adonijah and helped him.
{1Ki 1:7}   亚多尼雅与洗鲁雅的儿子约押，和祭司亚比亚他商议；二人就顺从他，帮助他。
{1Ki 1:8}   But Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and Nathan the prophet and Shimei and Rei and David's mighty men were not with Adonijah.
{1Ki 1:8}   但祭司撒督、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅、先知拿单、示每、利以，并大卫的勇士都不顺从亚多尼雅。
{1Ki 1:9}   Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the Serpent's Stone, which is beside En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of Judah,
{1Ki 1:9}   一日，亚多尼雅在隐罗结旁、琐希列磐石那里宰了牛羊、肥犊，请他的诸弟兄，就是王的众子，并所有作王臣仆的犹大人；
{1Ki 1:10}  but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother.
{1Ki 1:10}  惟独先知拿单和比拿雅并勇士，与他的兄弟所罗门，他都没有请。
{1Ki 1:11}  Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, "Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it?
{1Ki 1:11}  拿单对所罗门的母亲拔示巴说：“哈及的儿子亚多尼雅作王了，你没有听见吗？我们的主大卫却不知道。
{1Ki 1:12}  Now therefore come, let me give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
{1Ki 1:12}  现在我可以给你出个主意，好保全你和你儿子所罗门的性命。
{1Ki 1:13}  Go in at once to King David, and say to him, 'Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying, "Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne"? Why then is Adonijah king?'
{1Ki 1:13}  你进去见大卫王，对他说：‘我主我王啊，你不曾向婢女起誓说：你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上吗？现在亚多尼雅怎么作了王呢？’
{1Ki 1:14}  Then while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words."
{1Ki 1:14}  你还与王说话的时候，我也随后进去，证实你的话。”
{1Ki 1:15}  So Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber (now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king).
{1Ki 1:15}  拔示巴进入内室见王，王甚老迈，书念的童女亚比煞正伺候王。
{1Ki 1:16}  Bathsheba bowed and paid homage to the king, and the king said, "What do you desire?"
{1Ki 1:16}  拔示巴向王屈身下拜；王说：“你要什么？”
{1Ki 1:17}  She said to him, "My lord, you swore to your servant by the LORD your God, saying, 'Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.'
{1Ki 1:17}  他说：“我主啊，你曾向婢女指着耶和华你的神起誓说：‘你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上。’
{1Ki 1:18}  And now, behold, Adonijah is king, although you, my lord the king, do not know it.
{1Ki 1:18}  现在亚多尼雅作王了，我主我王却不知道。
{1Ki 1:19}  He has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but Solomon your servant he has not invited.
{1Ki 1:19}  他宰了许多牛羊、肥犊，请了王的众子和祭司亚比亚他，并元帅约押；惟独王的仆人所罗门，他没有请。
{1Ki 1:20}  And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
{1Ki 1:20}  我主我王啊，以色列众人的眼目都仰望你，等你晓谕他们，在我主我王之后谁坐你的位。
{1Ki 1:21}  Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders."
{1Ki 1:21}  若不然，到我主我王与列祖同睡以后，我和我儿子所罗门必算为罪人了。”
{1Ki 1:22}  While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.
{1Ki 1:22}  拔示巴还与王说话的时候，先知拿单也进来了。
{1Ki 1:23}  And they told the king, "Here is Nathan the prophet." And when he came in before the king, he bowed before the king, with his face to the ground.
{1Ki 1:23}  有人奏告王说：“先知拿单来了。”拿单进到王前，脸伏于地。
{1Ki 1:24}  And Nathan said, "My lord the king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne'?
{1Ki 1:24}  拿单说：“我主我王果然应许亚多尼雅说‘你必接续我作王，坐在我的位上’吗？
{1Ki 1:25}  For he has gone down this day and has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
{1Ki 1:25}  他今日下去，宰了许多牛羊、肥犊，请了王的众子和军长，并祭司亚比亚他；他们正在亚多尼雅面前吃喝，说：‘愿亚多尼雅王万岁！’
{1Ki 1:26}  But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he has not invited.
{1Ki 1:26}  惟独我，就是你的仆人和祭司撒督，耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，并王的仆人所罗门，他都没有请。
{1Ki 1:27}  Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not told your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
{1Ki 1:27}  这事果然出乎我主我王吗？王却没有告诉仆人们，在我主我王之后谁坐你的位。”
{1Ki 1:28}  Then King David answered, "Call Bathsheba to me." So she came into the king's presence and stood before the king.
{1Ki 1:28}  大卫王吩咐说：“叫拔示巴来。”拔示巴就进来，站在王面前。
{1Ki 1:29}  And the king swore, saying, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of every adversity,
{1Ki 1:29}  王起誓说：“我指着救我性命脱离一切苦难、永生的耶和华起誓。
{1Ki 1:30}  as I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying, 'Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,' even so will I do this day."
{1Ki 1:30}  我既然指着耶和华以色列的神向你起誓说：你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上。我今日就必照这话而行。”
{1Ki 1:31}  Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and paid homage to the king and said, "May my lord King David live forever!"
{1Ki 1:31}  于是，拔示巴脸伏于地，向王下拜，说：“愿我主大卫王万岁！”
{1Ki 1:32}  King David said, "Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." So they came before the king.
{1Ki 1:32}  大卫王又吩咐说：“将祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅召来！”他们就都来到王面前。
{1Ki 1:33}  And the king said to them, "Take with you the servants of your lord and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.
{1Ki 1:33}  王对他们说：“要带领你们主的仆人，使我儿子所罗门骑我的骡子，送他下到基训；
{1Ki 1:34}  And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet there anoint him king over Israel. Then blow the trumpet and say, 'Long live King Solomon!'
{1Ki 1:34}  在那里，祭司撒督和先知拿单要膏他作以色列的王；你们也要吹角，说：‘愿所罗门王万岁！’
{1Ki 1:35}  You shall then come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, for he shall be king in my place. And I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah."
{1Ki 1:35}  然后要跟随他上来，使他坐在我的位上，接续我作王。我已立他作以色列和犹大的君。”
{1Ki 1:36}  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, say so.
{1Ki 1:36}  耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅对王说：“阿们！愿耶和华我主我王的神也这样命定。
{1Ki 1:37}  As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David."
{1Ki 1:37}  耶和华怎样与我主我王同在，愿他照样与所罗门同在，使他的国位比我主大卫王的国位更大。”
{1Ki 1:38}  So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David's mule and brought him to Gihon.
{1Ki 1:38}  于是，祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，和基利提人、比利提人都下去使所罗门骑大卫王的骡子，将他送到基训。
{1Ki 1:39}  There Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, "Long live King Solomon!"
{1Ki 1:39}  祭司撒督就从帐幕中取了盛膏油的角来，用膏膏所罗门。人就吹角，众民都说：“愿所罗门王万岁！”
{1Ki 1:40}  And all the people went up after him, playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth was split by their noise.
{1Ki 1:40}  众民跟随他上来，且吹笛，大大欢呼，声音震地。
{1Ki 1:41}  Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, "What does this uproar in the city mean?"
{1Ki 1:41}  亚多尼雅和所请的众客筵宴方毕，听见这声音；约押听见角声就说：“城中为何有这响声呢？”
{1Ki 1:42}  While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said, "Come in, for you are a worthy man and bring good news."
{1Ki 1:42}  他正说话的时候，祭司亚比亚他的儿子约拿单来了。亚多尼雅对他说：“进来吧！你是个忠义的人，必是报好信息。”
{1Ki 1:43}  Jonathan answered Adonijah, "No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king,
{1Ki 1:43}  约拿单对亚多尼雅说：“我们的主大卫王诚然立所罗门为王了。
{1Ki 1:44}  and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And they had him ride on the king's mule.
{1Ki 1:44}  王差遣祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，和基利提人、比利提人都去使所罗门骑王的骡子。
{1Ki 1:45}  And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you have heard.
{1Ki 1:45}  祭司撒督和先知拿单在基训已经膏他作王。众人都从那里欢呼着上来，声音使城震动，这就是你们所听见的声音；
{1Ki 1:46}  Solomon sits on the royal throne.
{1Ki 1:46}  并且所罗门登了国位。
{1Ki 1:47}  Moreover, the king's servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his throne greater than your throne.' And the king bowed himself on the bed.
{1Ki 1:47}  王的臣仆也来为我们的主大卫王祝福，说：‘愿王的神使所罗门的名比王的名更尊荣；使他的国位比王的国位更大。’王就在床上屈身下拜。
{1Ki 1:48}  And the king also said, 'Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has granted someone to sit on my throne this day, my own eyes seeing it.'"
{1Ki 1:48}  王又说：‘耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的；因他赐我一人今日坐在我的位上，我也亲眼看见了。’”
{1Ki 1:49}  Then all the guests of Adonijah trembled and rose, and each went his own way.
{1Ki 1:49}  亚多尼雅的众客听见这话就都惊惧，起来四散。
{1Ki 1:50}  And Adonijah feared Solomon. So he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the altar.
{1Ki 1:50}  亚多尼雅惧怕所罗门，就起来，去抓住祭坛的角。
{1Ki 1:51}  Then it was told Solomon, "Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, for behold, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'"
{1Ki 1:51}  有人告诉所罗门说：“亚多尼雅惧怕所罗门王，现在抓住祭坛的角，说：‘愿所罗门王今日向我起誓，必不用刀杀仆人。’”
{1Ki 1:52}  And Solomon said, "If he will show himself a worthy man, not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth, but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die."
{1Ki 1:52}  所罗门说：“他若作忠义的人，连一根头发也不至落在地上；他若行恶，必要死亡。”
{1Ki 1:53}  So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and paid homage to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, "Go to your house."
{1Ki 1:53}  于是所罗门王差遣人，使亚多尼雅从坛上下来，他就来，向所罗门王下拜；所罗门对他说：“你回家去吧！”
{1Ki 2:1}   When David's time to die drew near, he commanded Solomon his son, saying,
{1Ki 2:1}   大卫的死期临近了，就嘱吩他儿子所罗门说：
{1Ki 2:2}   "I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong, and show yourself a man,
{1Ki 2:2}   “我现在要走世人必走的路。所以，你当刚强，作大丈夫，
{1Ki 2:3}   and keep the charge of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn,
{1Ki 2:3}   遵守耶和华你神所吩咐的，照着摩西律法上所写的行主的道，谨守他的律例、诫命、典章、法度。这样，你无论做什么事，不拘往何处去，尽都亨通。
{1Ki 2:4}   that the LORD may establish his word that he spoke concerning me, saying, 'If your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.'
{1Ki 2:4}   耶和华必成就向我所应许的话说：‘你的子孙若谨慎自己的行为，尽心尽意诚诚实实地行在我面前，就不断人坐以色列的国位。’
{1Ki 2:5}   "Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, Abner the son of Ner, and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, avenging in time of peace for blood that had been shed in war, and putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet.
{1Ki 2:5}   你知道洗鲁雅的儿子约押向我所行的，就是杀了以色列的两个元帅：尼珥的儿子押尼珥和益帖的儿子亚玛撒。他在太平之时流这二人的血，如在争战之时一样，将这血染了腰间束的带和脚上穿的鞋。
{1Ki 2:6}   Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.
{1Ki 2:6}   所以你要照你的智慧行，不容他白头安然下阴间。
{1Ki 2:7}   But deal loyally with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for with such loyalty they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother.
{1Ki 2:7}   你当恩待基列人巴西莱的众子，使他们常与你同席吃饭；因为我躲避你哥哥押沙龙的时候，他们拿食物来迎接我。
{1Ki 2:8}   And there is also with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD, saying, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.'
{1Ki 2:8}   在你这里有巴户琳的便雅悯人，基拉的儿子示每；我往玛哈念去的那日，他用狠毒的言语咒骂我，后来却下约但河迎接我，我就指着耶和华向他起誓说：‘我必不用刀杀你。’
{1Ki 2:9}   Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol."
{1Ki 2:9}   现在你不要以他为无罪。你是聪明人，必知道怎样待他，使他白头见杀，流血下到阴间。”
{1Ki 2:10}  Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.
{1Ki 2:10}  大卫与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城。
{1Ki 2:11}  And the time that David reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
{1Ki 2:11}  大卫作以色列王四十年：在希伯仑作王七年，在耶路撒冷作王三十三年。
{1Ki 2:12}  So Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.
{1Ki 2:12}  所罗门坐他父亲大卫的位，他的国甚是坚固。
{1Ki 2:13}  Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, "Do you come peacefully?" He said, "Peacefully."
{1Ki 2:13}  哈及的儿子亚多尼雅去见所罗门的母亲拔示巴，拔示巴问他说：“你来是为平安吗？”回答说：“是为平安”；
{1Ki 2:14}  Then he said, "I have something to say to you." She said, "Speak."
{1Ki 2:14}  又说：“我有话对你说。”拔示巴说：“你说吧。”
{1Ki 2:15}  He said, "You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully expected me to reign. However, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother's, for it was his from the LORD.
{1Ki 2:15}  亚多尼雅说：“你知道国原是归我的，以色列众人也都仰望我作王，不料，国反归了我兄弟，因他得国是出乎耶和华。
{1Ki 2:16}  And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me." She said to him, "Speak."
{1Ki 2:16}  现在我有一件事求你，望你不要推辞。”拔示巴说：“你说吧。”
{1Ki 2:17}  And he said, "Please ask King Solomon--he will not refuse you--to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife."
{1Ki 2:17}  他说：“求你请所罗门王将书念的女子亚比煞赐我为妻，因他必不推辞你。”
{1Ki 2:18}  Bathsheba said, "Very well; I will speak for you to the king."
{1Ki 2:18}  拔示巴说：“好，我必为你对王提说。”
{1Ki 2:19}  So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne and had a seat brought for the king's mother, and she sat on his right.
{1Ki 2:19}  于是，拔示巴去见所罗门王，要为亚多尼雅提说；王起来迎接，向他下拜，就坐在位上，吩咐人为王母设一座位，他便坐在王的右边。
{1Ki 2:20}  Then she said, "I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me." And the king said to her, "Make your request, my mother, for I will not refuse you."
{1Ki 2:20}  拔示巴说：“我有一件小事求你，望你不要推辞。”王说：“请母亲说，我必不推辞。”
{1Ki 2:21}  She said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife."
{1Ki 2:21}  拔示巴说：“求你将书念的女子亚比煞赐给你哥哥亚多尼雅为妻。”
{1Ki 2:22}  King Solomon answered his mother, "And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my older brother, and on his side are Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah."
{1Ki 2:22}  所罗门王对他母亲说：“为何单替他求书念的女子亚比煞呢？也可以为他求国吧！他是我的哥哥，他有祭司亚比亚他和洗鲁雅的儿子约押为辅佐。”
{1Ki 2:23}  Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, "God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adonijah his life!
{1Ki 2:23}  所罗门王就指着耶和华起誓说：“亚多尼雅这话是自己送命，不然，愿神重重的降罚与我。
{1Ki 2:24}  Now therefore as the LORD lives, who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today."
{1Ki 2:24}  耶和华坚立我，使我坐在父亲大卫的位上，照着所应许的话为我建立家室；现在我指着永生的耶和华起誓，亚多尼雅今日必被治死。”
{1Ki 2:25}  So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he struck him down, and he died.
{1Ki 2:25}  于是所罗门王差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，将亚多尼雅杀死。
{1Ki 2:26}  And to Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go to Anathoth, to your estate, for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because you shared in all my father's affliction."
{1Ki 2:26}  王对祭司亚比亚他说：“你回亚拿突归自己的田地去吧！你本是该死的，但因你在我父亲大卫面前抬过主耶和华的约柜，又与我父亲同受一切苦难，所以我今日不将你杀死。”
{1Ki 2:27}  So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, thus fulfilling the word of the LORD that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
{1Ki 2:27}  所罗门就革除亚比亚他，不许他作耶和华的祭司。这样，便应验耶和华在示罗论以利家所说的话。
{1Ki 2:28}  When the news came to Joab--for Joab had supported Adonijah although he had not supported Absalom--Joab fled to the tent of the LORD and caught hold of the horns of the altar.
{1Ki 2:28}  约押虽然没有归从押沙龙，却归从了亚多尼雅。他听见这风声，就逃到耶和华的帐幕，抓住祭坛的角。
{1Ki 2:29}  And when it was told King Solomon, "Joab has fled to the tent of the LORD, and behold, he is beside the altar," Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, "Go, strike him down."
{1Ki 2:29}  有人告诉所罗门王说：“约押逃到耶和华的帐幕，现今在祭坛的旁边。”所罗门就差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，说：“你去将他杀死。”
{1Ki 2:30}  So Benaiah came to the tent of the LORD and said to him, "The king commands, 'Come out.'" But he said, "No, I will die here." Then Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, "Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me."
{1Ki 2:30}  比拿雅来到耶和华的帐幕，对约押说：“王吩咐说，你出来吧！”他说：“我不出去，我要死在这里。”比拿雅就去回覆王，说约押如此如此回答我。
{1Ki 2:31}  The king replied to him, "Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him, and thus take away from me and from my father's house the guilt for the blood that Joab shed without cause.
{1Ki 2:31}  王说：“你可以照着他的话行，杀死他，将他葬埋，好叫约押流无辜人血的罪不归我和我的父家了。
{1Ki 2:32}  The LORD will bring back his bloody deeds on his own head, because, without the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than himself, Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.
{1Ki 2:32}  耶和华必使约押流人血的罪归到他自己的头上；因为他用刀杀了两个比他又义又好的人，就是以色列元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥和犹大元帅益帖的儿子亚玛撒，我父亲大卫却不知道。
{1Ki 2:33}  So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever. But for David and for his descendants and for his house and for his throne there shall be peace from the LORD forevermore."
{1Ki 2:33}  故此，流这二人血的罪必归到约押和他后裔的头上，直到永远；惟有大卫和他的后裔，并他的家与国，必从耶和华那里得平安，直到永远。”
{1Ki 2:34}  Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and put him to death. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
{1Ki 2:34}  于是耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅上去，将约押杀死，葬在旷野约押自己的坟墓（原文作房屋）里。
{1Ki 2:35}  The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.
{1Ki 2:35}  王就立耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅作元帅，代替约押，又使祭司撒督代替亚比亚他。
{1Ki 2:36}  Then the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there to any place whatever.
{1Ki 2:36}  王差遣人将示每召来，对他说：“你要在耶路撒冷建造房屋居住，不可出来往别处去。
{1Ki 2:37}  For on the day you go out and cross the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall die. Your blood shall be on your own head."
{1Ki 2:37}  你当确实地知道，你何日出来过汲沦溪，何日必死！你的罪（原文作血）必归到自己的头上。”
{1Ki 2:38}  And Shimei said to the king, "What you say is good; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do." So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.
{1Ki 2:38}  示每对王说：“这话甚好！我主我王怎样说，仆人必怎样行。”于是示每多日住在耶路撒冷。
{1Ki 2:39}  But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shimei's servants ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And when it was told Shimei, "Behold, your servants are in Gath,"
{1Ki 2:39}  过了三年，示每的两个仆人逃到迦特王玛迦的儿子亚吉那里去。有人告诉示每说：“你的仆人在迦特。”
{1Ki 2:40}  Shimei arose and saddled a donkey and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.
{1Ki 2:40}  示每起来，备上驴，往迦特到亚吉那里去找他的仆人，就从迦特带他仆人回来。
{1Ki 2:41}  And when Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned,
{1Ki 2:41}  有人告诉所罗门说：“示每出耶路撒冷往迦特去，回来了。”
{1Ki 2:42}  the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you, saying, 'Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place whatever, you shall die'? And you said to me, 'What you say is good; I will obey.'
{1Ki 2:42}  王就差遣人将示每召了来，对他说：“我岂不是叫你指着耶和华起誓，并且警戒你说‘你当确实地知道，你那日出来往别处去，那日必死’吗？你也对我说：‘这话甚好，我必听从。’
{1Ki 2:43}  Why then have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the commandment with which I commanded you?"
{1Ki 2:43}  现在你为何不遵守你指着耶和华起的誓和我所吩咐你的命令呢？”
{1Ki 2:44}  The king also said to Shimei, "You know in your own heart all the harm that you did to David my father. So the LORD will bring back your harm on your own head.
{1Ki 2:44}  王又对示每说：“你向我父亲大卫所行的一切恶事，你自己心里也知道，所以耶和华必使你的罪恶归到自己的头上；
{1Ki 2:45}  But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever."
{1Ki 2:45}  惟有所罗门王必得福，并且大卫的国位必在耶和华面前坚定，直到永远。”
{1Ki 2:46}  Then the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck him down, and he died. So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
{1Ki 2:46}  于是王吩咐耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，他就去杀死示每。这样，便坚定了所罗门的国位。
{1Ki 3:1}   Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem.
{1Ki 3:1}   所罗门与埃及王法老结亲，娶了法老的女儿为妻，接他进入大卫城，直等到造完了自己的宫和耶和华的殿，并耶路撒冷周围的城墙。
{1Ki 3:2}   The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the LORD.
{1Ki 3:2}   当那些日子，百姓仍在邱坛献祭，因为还没有为耶和华的名建殿。
{1Ki 3:3}   Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father, only he sacrificed and made offerings at the high places.
{1Ki 3:3}   所罗门爱耶和华，遵行他父亲大卫的律例，只是还在邱坛献祭烧香。
{1Ki 3:4}   And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
{1Ki 3:4}   所罗门王上基遍去献祭；因为在那里有极大（或作：出名）的邱坛，他在那坛上献一千牺牲作燔祭。
{1Ki 3:5}   At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, "Ask what I shall give you."
{1Ki 3:5}   在基遍，夜间梦中，耶和华向所罗门显现，对他说：“你愿我赐你什么？你可以求。”
{1Ki 3:6}   And Solomon said, "You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you. And you have kept for him this great and steadfast love and have given him a son to sit on his throne this day.
{1Ki 3:6}   所罗门说：“你仆人我父亲大卫用诚实、公义、正直的心行在你面前，你就向他大施恩典，又为他存留大恩，赐他一个儿子坐在他的位上，正如今日一样。
{1Ki 3:7}   And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father, although I am but a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in.
{1Ki 3:7}   耶和华我的神啊，如今你使仆人接续我父亲大卫作王；但我是幼童，不知道应当怎样出入。
{1Ki 3:8}   And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted for multitude.
{1Ki 3:8}   仆人住在你所拣选的民中，这民多得不可胜数。
{1Ki 3:9}   Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?"
{1Ki 3:9}   所以求你赐我智慧，可以判断你的民，能辨别是非。不然，谁能判断这众多的民呢？”
{1Ki 3:10}  It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this.
{1Ki 3:10}  所罗门因为求这事，就蒙主喜悦。
{1Ki 3:11}  And God said to him, "Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right,
{1Ki 3:11}  神对他说：“你既然求这事，不为自己求寿、求富，也不求灭绝你仇敌的性命，单求智慧可以听讼，
{1Ki 3:12}  behold, I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you.
{1Ki 3:12}  我就应允你所求的，赐你聪明智慧，甚至在你以前没有像你的，在你以后也没有像你的。
{1Ki 3:13}  I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days.
{1Ki 3:13}  你所没有求的，我也赐给你，就是富足、尊荣，使你在世的日子，列王中没有一个能比你的。
{1Ki 3:14}  And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days."
{1Ki 3:14}  你若效法你父亲大卫，遵行我的道，谨守我的律例、诫命，我必使你长寿。”
{1Ki 3:15}  And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.
{1Ki 3:15}  所罗门醒了，不料是个梦。他就回到耶路撒冷，站在耶和华的约柜前，献燔祭和平安祭，又为他众臣仆设摆筵席。
{1Ki 3:16}  Then two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
{1Ki 3:16}  一日，有两个妓女来，站在王面前。
{1Ki 3:17}  The one woman said, "Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house.
{1Ki 3:17}  一个说：“我主啊，我和这妇人同住一房；他在房中的时候，我生了一个男孩。
{1Ki 3:18}  Then on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. And we were alone. There was no one else with us in the house; only we two were in the house.
{1Ki 3:18}  我生孩子后第三日，这妇人也生了孩子。我们是同住的，除了我们二人之外，房中再没有别人。
{1Ki 3:19}  And this woman's son died in the night, because she lay on him.
{1Ki 3:19}  夜间，这妇人睡着的时候，压死了他的孩子。
{1Ki 3:20}  And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me, while your servant slept, and laid him at her breast, and laid her dead son at my breast.
{1Ki 3:20}  他半夜起来，趁我睡着，从我旁边把我的孩子抱去，放在他怀里，将他的死孩子放在我怀里。
{1Ki 3:21}  When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, he was dead. But when I looked at him closely in the morning, behold, he was not the child that I had borne."
{1Ki 3:21}  天要亮的时候，我起来要给我的孩子吃奶，不料，孩子死了；及至天亮，我细细地察看，不是我所生的孩子。”
{1Ki 3:22}  But the other woman said, "No, the living child is mine, and the dead child is yours." The first said, "No, the dead child is yours, and the living child is mine." Thus they spoke before the king.
{1Ki 3:22}  那妇人说：“不然，活孩子是我的，死孩子是你的。”这妇人说：“不然，死孩子是你的，活孩子是我的。”他们在王面前如此争论。
{1Ki 3:23}  Then the king said, "The one says, 'This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead'; and the other says, 'No; but your son is dead, and my son is the living one.'"
{1Ki 3:23}  王说：“这妇人说‘活孩子是我的，死孩子是你的’，那妇人说‘不然，死孩子是你的，活孩子是我的’”，
{1Ki 3:24}  And the king said, "Bring me a sword." So a sword was brought before the king.
{1Ki 3:24}  就吩咐说：“拿刀来！”人就拿刀来。
{1Ki 3:25}  And the king said, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other."
{1Ki 3:25}  王说：“将活孩子劈成两半，一半给那妇人，一半给这妇人。”
{1Ki 3:26}  Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king, because her heart yearned for her son, "Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means put him to death." But the other said, "He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him."
{1Ki 3:26}  活孩子的母亲为自己的孩子心里急痛，就说：“求我主将活孩子给那妇人吧，万不可杀他！”那妇人说：“这孩子也不归我，也不归你，把他劈了吧！”
{1Ki 3:27}  Then the king answered and said, "Give the living child to the first woman, and by no means put him to death; she is his mother."
{1Ki 3:27}  王说：“将活孩子给这妇人，万不可杀他；这妇人实在是他的母亲。”
{1Ki 3:28}  And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered, and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him to do justice.
{1Ki 3:28}  以色列众人听见王这样判断，就都敬畏他；因为见他心里有神的智慧，能以断案。

{1Ki 5:1}   Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram always loved David.
{1Ki 5:1}   推罗王希兰，平素爱大卫；他听见以色列人膏所罗门，接续他父亲作王，就差遣臣仆来见他。
{1Ki 5:2}   And Solomon sent word to Hiram,
{1Ki 5:2}   所罗门也差遣人去见希兰，说：
{1Ki 5:3}   "You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
{1Ki 5:3}   “你知道我父亲大卫因四围的争战，不能为耶和华他神的名建殿，直等到耶和华使仇敌都服在他脚下。
{1Ki 5:4}   But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune.
{1Ki 5:4}   现在耶和华我的神使我四围平安，没有仇敌，没有灾祸。
{1Ki 5:5}   And so I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD said to David my father, 'Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.'
{1Ki 5:5}   我定意要为耶和华我神的名建殿，是照耶和华应许我父亲大卫的话说：‘我必使你儿子接续你坐你的位，他必为我的名建殿。’
{1Ki 5:6}   Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians."
{1Ki 5:6}   所以求你吩咐你的仆人在利巴嫩为我砍伐香柏木，我的仆人也必帮助他们，我必照你所定的，给你仆人的工价；因为你知道，在我们中间没有人像西顿人善于砍伐树木。”
{1Ki 5:7}   As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, "Blessed be the LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people."
{1Ki 5:7}   希兰听见所罗门的话，就甚喜悦，说：“今日应当称颂耶和华；因他赐给大卫一个有智慧的儿子，治理这众多的民。”
{1Ki 5:8}   And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, "I have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber.
{1Ki 5:8}   希兰打发人去见所罗门，说：“你差遣人向我所提的那事，我都听见了；论到香柏木和松木，我必照你的心愿而行。
{1Ki 5:9}   My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household."
{1Ki 5:9}   我的仆人必将这木料从利巴嫩运到海里，扎成筏子，浮海运到你所指定我的地方，在那里拆开，你就可以收取；你也要成全我的心愿，将食物给我的家。”
{1Ki 5:10}  So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired,
{1Ki 5:10}  于是希兰照着所罗门所要的，给他香柏木和松木；
{1Ki 5:11}  while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000 cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.
{1Ki 5:11}  所罗门给希兰麦子二万歌珥，清油二十歌珥，作他家的食物。所罗门每年都是这样给希兰。
{1Ki 5:12}  And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.
{1Ki 5:12}  耶和华照着所应许的赐智慧给所罗门。希兰与所罗门和好，彼此立约。
{1Ki 5:13}  King Solomon drafted forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men.
{1Ki 5:13}  所罗门王从以色列人中挑取服苦的人共有三万，
{1Ki 5:14}  And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the draft.
{1Ki 5:14}  派他们轮流每月一万人上利巴嫩去；一个月在利巴嫩，两个月在家里。亚多尼兰掌管他们。
{1Ki 5:15}  Solomon also had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country,
{1Ki 5:15}  所罗门用七万扛抬的，八万在山上凿石头的。
{1Ki 5:16}  besides Solomon's 3,300 chief officers who were over the work, who had charge of the people who carried on the work.
{1Ki 5:16}  此外，所罗门用三千三百督工的，监管工人。
{1Ki 5:17}  At the king's command they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones.
{1Ki 5:17}  王下令，人就凿出又大又宝贵的石头来，用以立殿的根基。
{1Ki 5:18}  So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.
{1Ki 5:18}  所罗门的匠人和希兰的匠人，并迦巴勒人，都将石头凿好，预备木料和石头建殿。
{1Ki 6:1}   In the four hundred and eightieth year after the people of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, he began to build the house of the LORD.
{1Ki 6:1}   以色列人出埃及地后四百八十年，所罗门作以色列王第四年西弗月，就是二月，开工建造耶和华的殿。
{1Ki 6:2}   The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.
{1Ki 6:2}   所罗门王为耶和华所建的殿，长六十肘，宽二十肘，高三十肘。
{1Ki 6:3}   The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house.
{1Ki 6:3}   殿前的廊子长二十肘，与殿的宽窄一样，阔十肘；
{1Ki 6:4}   And he made for the house windows with recessed frames.
{1Ki 6:4}   又为殿做了严紧的窗棂。
{1Ki 6:5}   He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary. And he made side chambers all around.
{1Ki 6:5}   靠着殿墙，围着外殿内殿，造了三层旁屋；
{1Ki 6:6}   The lowest story was five cubits broad, the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad. For around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.
{1Ki 6:6}   下层宽五肘，中层宽六肘，上层宽七肘。殿外旁屋的梁木搁在殿墙坎上，免得插入殿墙。
{1Ki 6:7}   When the house was built, it was with stone prepared at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built.
{1Ki 6:7}   建殿是用山中凿成的石头。建殿的时候，锤子、斧子，和别样铁器的响声都没有听见。
{1Ki 6:8}   The entrance for the lowest story was on the south side of the house, and one went up by stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third.
{1Ki 6:8}   在殿右边当中的旁屋有门，门内有旋螺的楼梯，可以上到第二层，从第二层可以上到第三层。
{1Ki 6:9}   So he built the house and finished it, and he made the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar.
{1Ki 6:9}   所罗门建殿，安置香柏木的栋梁，又用香柏木板遮盖。
{1Ki 6:10}  He built the structure against the whole house, five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.
{1Ki 6:10}  靠着殿所造的旁屋，每层高五肘，香柏木的栋梁搁在殿墙坎上。
{1Ki 6:11}  Now the word of the LORD came to Solomon,
{1Ki 6:11}  耶和华的话临到所罗门说：
{1Ki 6:12}  "Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes and obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.
{1Ki 6:12}  “论到你所建的这殿，你若遵行我的律例，谨守我的典章，遵从我的一切诫命，我必向你应验我所应许你父亲大卫的话。
{1Ki 6:13}  And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake my people Israel."
{1Ki 6:13}  我必住在以色列人中间，并不丢弃我民以色列。”
{1Ki 6:14}  So Solomon built the house and finished it.
{1Ki 6:14}  所罗门建造殿宇。
{1Ki 6:15}  He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood, and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress.
{1Ki 6:15}  殿里面用香柏木板贴墙，从地到棚顶都用木板遮蔽，又用松木板铺地。
{1Ki 6:16}  He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as the Most Holy Place.
{1Ki 6:16}  内殿，就是至圣所，长二十肘，从地到棚顶用香柏木板遮蔽（或作：隔断）。
{1Ki 6:17}  The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long.
{1Ki 6:17}  内殿前的外殿，长四十肘。
{1Ki 6:18}  The cedar within the house was carved in the form of gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was seen.
{1Ki 6:18}  殿里一点石头都不显露，一概用香柏木遮蔽；上面刻着野瓜和初开的花。
{1Ki 6:19}  The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
{1Ki 6:19}  殿里预备了内殿，好安放耶和华的约柜。
{1Ki 6:20}  The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid an altar of cedar.
{1Ki 6:20}  内殿长二十肘，宽二十肘，高二十肘，墙面都贴上精金；又用香柏木做坛，包上精金。
{1Ki 6:21}  And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.
{1Ki 6:21}  所罗门用精金贴了殿内的墙，又用金链子挂在内殿前门扇，用金包裹。
{1Ki 6:22}  And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.
{1Ki 6:22}  全殿都贴上金子，直到贴完；内殿前的坛，也都用金包裹。
{1Ki 6:23}  In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high.
{1Ki 6:23}  他用橄榄木做两个基路伯，各高十肘，安在内殿。
{1Ki 6:24}  Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.
{1Ki 6:24}  这一个基路伯有两个翅膀，各长五肘，从这翅膀尖到那翅膀尖共有十肘；
{1Ki 6:25}  The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form.
{1Ki 6:25}  那一个基路伯的两个翅膀也是十肘，两个基路伯的尺寸、形像都是一样。
{1Ki 6:26}  The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub.
{1Ki 6:26}  这基路伯高十肘，那基路伯也是如此。
{1Ki 6:27}  He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house. And the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house.
{1Ki 6:27}  他将两个基路伯安在内殿里；基路伯的翅膀是张开的，这基路伯的一个翅膀挨着这边的墙，那基路伯的一个翅膀挨着那边的墙，里边的两个翅膀在殿中间彼此相接；
{1Ki 6:28}  And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
{1Ki 6:28}  又用金子包裹二基路伯。
{1Ki 6:29}  Around all the walls of the house he carved engraved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms.
{1Ki 6:29}  内殿、外殿周围的墙上都刻着基路伯、棕树，和初开的花。
{1Ki 6:30}  The floor of the house he overlaid with gold in the inner and outer rooms.
{1Ki 6:30}  内殿、外殿的地板都贴上金子。
{1Ki 6:31}  For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided.
{1Ki 6:31}  又用橄榄木制造内殿的门扇、门楣、门框；门口有墙的五分之一。
{1Ki 6:32}  He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. He overlaid them with gold and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.
{1Ki 6:32}  在橄榄木做的两门扇上刻着基路伯、棕树，和初开的花，都贴上金子。
{1Ki 6:33}  So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square,
{1Ki 6:33}  又用橄榄木制造外殿的门框，门口有墙的四分之一。
{1Ki 6:34}  and two doors of cypress wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
{1Ki 6:34}  用松木做门两扇。这扇分两扇，是摺叠的；那扇分两扇；也是摺叠的。
{1Ki 6:35}  On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work.
{1Ki 6:35}  上面刻着基路伯、棕树，和初开的花，都用金子贴了。
{1Ki 6:36}  He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams.
{1Ki 6:36}  他又用凿成的石头三层、香柏木一层建筑内院。
{1Ki 6:37}  In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv.
{1Ki 6:37}  所罗门在位第四年西弗月，立了耶和华殿的根基。
{1Ki 6:38}  And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications. He was seven years in building it.
{1Ki 6:38}  到十一年布勒月，就是八月，殿和一切属殿的都按着样式造成。他建殿的工夫共有七年。
{1Ki 7:1}   Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished his entire house.
{1Ki 7:1}   所罗门为自己建造宫室，十三年方才造成；
{1Ki 7:2}   He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon. Its length was a hundred cubits and its breadth fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits, and it was built on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.
{1Ki 7:2}   又建造利巴嫩林宫，长一百肘，宽五十肘，高三十肘，有香柏木柱三（原文作四）行，柱上有香柏木柁梁。
{1Ki 7:3}   And it was covered with cedar above the chambers that were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row.
{1Ki 7:3}   其上以香柏木为盖，每行柱子十五根，共有四十五根。
{1Ki 7:4}   There were window frames in three rows, and window opposite window in three tiers.
{1Ki 7:4}   有窗户三层，窗与窗相对。
{1Ki 7:5}   All the doorways and windows had square frames, and window was opposite window in three tiers.
{1Ki 7:5}   所有的门框都是厚木见方的，有窗户三层，窗与窗相对。
{1Ki 7:6}   And he made the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits. There was a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy in front of them.
{1Ki 7:6}   并建造有柱子的廊子，长五十肘，宽三十肘；在这廊前又有廊子，廊外有柱子和台阶。
{1Ki 7:7}   And he made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, even the Hall of Judgment. It was finished with cedar from floor to rafters.
{1Ki 7:7}   又建造一廊，其中设立审判的座位，这廊从地到顶都用香柏木遮蔽。
{1Ki 7:8}   His own house where he was to dwell, in the other court back of the hall, was of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter whom he had taken in marriage.
{1Ki 7:8}   廊后院内有所罗门住的宫室；工作与这工作相同。所罗门又为所娶法老的女儿建造一宫，做法与这廊子一样。
{1Ki 7:9}   All these were made of costly stones, cut according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front, even from the foundation to the coping, and from the outside to the great court.
{1Ki 7:9}   建造这一切所用的石头都是宝贵的，是按着尺寸凿成的，是用锯里外锯齐的；从根基直到檐石，从外头直到大院，都是如此。
{1Ki 7:10}  The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and ten cubits.
{1Ki 7:10}  根基是宝贵的大石头，有长十肘的，有长八肘的；
{1Ki 7:11}  And above were costly stones, cut according to measurement, and cedar.
{1Ki 7:11}  上面有香柏木和按着尺寸凿成宝贵的石头。
{1Ki 7:12}  The great court had three courses of cut stone all around, and a course of cedar beams; so had the inner court of the house of the LORD and the vestibule of the house.
{1Ki 7:12}  大院周围有凿成的石头三层、香柏木一层，都照耶和华殿的内院和殿廊的样式。
{1Ki 7:13}  And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre.
{1Ki 7:13}  所罗门王差遣人往推罗去，将户兰召了来。
{1Ki 7:14}  He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze. And he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon and did all his work.
{1Ki 7:14}  他是拿弗他利支派中一个寡妇的儿子，他父亲是推罗人，作铜匠的。户兰满有智慧、聪明、技能，善于各样铜作。他来到所罗门王那里，做王一切所要做的。
{1Ki 7:15}  He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference. It was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers. The second pillar was the same.
{1Ki 7:15}  他制造两根铜柱，每根高十八肘，围十二肘；
{1Ki 7:16}  He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
{1Ki 7:16}  又用铜铸了两个柱顶安在柱上，各高五肘。
{1Ki 7:17}  There were lattices of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals on the tops of the pillars, a lattice for the one capital and a lattice for the other capital.
{1Ki 7:17}  柱顶上有装修的网子和拧成的链索，每顶七个。
{1Ki 7:18}  Likewise he made pomegranates in two rows around the one latticework to cover the capital that was on the top of the pillar, and he did the same with the other capital.
{1Ki 7:18}  网子周围有两行石榴遮盖柱顶，两个柱顶都是如此。
{1Ki 7:19}  Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits.
{1Ki 7:19}  廊子的柱顶径四肘，刻着百合花。
{1Ki 7:20}  The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the latticework. There were two hundred pomegranates in two rows all around, and so with the other capital.
{1Ki 7:20}  两柱顶的鼓肚上挨着网子，各有两行石榴环绕，两行共有二百。
{1Ki 7:21}  He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple. He set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz.
{1Ki 7:21}  他将两根柱子立在殿廊前头：右边立一根，起名叫雅斤；左边立一根，起名叫波阿斯。
{1Ki 7:22}  And on the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.
{1Ki 7:22}  在柱顶上刻着百合花。这样，造柱子的工就完毕了。
{1Ki 7:23}  Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.
{1Ki 7:23}  他又铸一个铜海，样式是圆的，高五肘，径十肘，围三十肘。
{1Ki 7:24}  Under its brim were gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.
{1Ki 7:24}  在海边之下，周围有野瓜的样式；每肘十瓜，共有两行，是铸海的时候铸上的。
{1Ki 7:25}  It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward.
{1Ki 7:25}  有十二只铜牛驮海：三只向北，三只向西，三只向南，三只向东；海在牛上，牛尾都向内。
{1Ki 7:26}  Its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.
{1Ki 7:26}  海厚一掌，边如杯边，又如百合花，可容二千罢特。
{1Ki 7:27}  He also made the ten stands of bronze. Each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.
{1Ki 7:27}  他用铜制造十个盆座，每座长四肘，宽四肘，高三肘。
{1Ki 7:28}  This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames,
{1Ki 7:28}  座的造法是这样：四面都有心子，心子在边子当中，
{1Ki 7:29}  and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work.
{1Ki 7:29}  心子上有狮子和牛，并基路伯；边上有小座，狮子和牛以下有垂下的璎珞。
{1Ki 7:30}  Moreover, each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and at the four corners were supports for a basin. The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each.
{1Ki 7:30}  每盆座有四个铜轮和铜轴。小座的四角上在盆以下，有铸成的盆架，其旁都有璎珞。
{1Ki 7:31}  Its opening was within a crown that projected upward one cubit. Its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round.
{1Ki 7:31}  小座高一肘，口是圆的，彷佛座的样式，径一肘半，在口上有雕工，心子是方的，不是圆的。
{1Ki 7:32}  And the four wheels were underneath the panels. The axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands, and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.
{1Ki 7:32}  四个轮子在心子以下，轮轴与座相连，每轮高一肘半。
{1Ki 7:33}  The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.
{1Ki 7:33}  轮的样式如同车轮；轴、辋、辐、毂都是铸的。
{1Ki 7:34}  There were four supports at the four corners of each stand. The supports were of one piece with the stands.
{1Ki 7:34}  每座四角上都有盆架，是与座一同铸成的。
{1Ki 7:35}  And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it.
{1Ki 7:35}  座上有圆架，高半肘；座上有撑子和心子，是与座一同铸的。
{1Ki 7:36}  And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.
{1Ki 7:36}  在撑子和心子上刻着基路伯、狮子，和棕树，周围有璎珞。
{1Ki 7:37}  After this manner he made the ten stands. All of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.
{1Ki 7:37}  十个盆座都是这样，铸法、尺寸、样式相同。
{1Ki 7:38}  And he made ten basins of bronze. Each basin held forty baths, each basin measured four cubits, and there was a basin for each of the ten stands.
{1Ki 7:38}  又用铜制造十个盆，每盆可容四十罢特。盆径四肘，在那十座上，每座安设一盆。
{1Ki 7:39}  And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house. And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.
{1Ki 7:39}  五个安在殿门的右边，五个放在殿门的左边；又将海放在殿门的右旁，就是南边。
{1Ki 7:40}  Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the LORD:
{1Ki 7:40}  户兰又造了盆、铲子，和盘子。这样，他为所罗门王做完了耶和华殿的一切工。
{1Ki 7:41}  the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars;
{1Ki 7:41}  所造的就是：两根柱子和柱上两个如球的顶；并两个盖柱顶的网子；
{1Ki 7:42}  and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;
{1Ki 7:42}  和四百石榴，安在两个网子上，每网两行，盖着两个柱上如球的顶；
{1Ki 7:43}  the ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands;
{1Ki 7:43}  十个座和其上的十个盆；
{1Ki 7:44}  and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.
{1Ki 7:44}  海和海下的十二只牛；
{1Ki 7:45}  Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the LORD, which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished bronze.
{1Ki 7:45}  盆、铲子、盘子。这一切都是户兰给所罗门王用光亮的铜为耶和华的殿造成的，
{1Ki 7:46}  In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
{1Ki 7:46}  是遵王命在约但平原、疏割和撒拉旦中间藉胶泥铸成的。
{1Ki 7:47}  And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.
{1Ki 7:47}  这一切所罗门都没有过秤；因为甚多，铜的轻重也无法可查。
{1Ki 7:48}  So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence,
{1Ki 7:48}  所罗门又造耶和华殿里的金坛和陈设饼的金桌子；
{1Ki 7:49}  the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;
{1Ki 7:49}  内殿前的精金灯台：右边五个，左边五个，并其上的金花、灯盏、蜡剪，
{1Ki 7:50}  the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple.
{1Ki 7:50}  与精金的杯、盘、镊子、调羹、火鼎，以及至圣所、内殿的门枢，和外殿的门枢。
{1Ki 7:51}  Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
{1Ki 7:51}  所罗门王做完了耶和华殿的一切工，就把他父大卫分别为圣的金银和器皿都带来放在耶和华殿的府库里。
{1Ki 8:1}   Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel, before King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
{1Ki 8:1}   那时，所罗门将以色列的长老和各支派的首领，并以色列的族长，招聚到耶路撒冷，要把耶和华的约柜从大卫城就是锡安运上来。
{1Ki 8:2}   And all the men of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
{1Ki 8:2}   以他念月，就是七月，在节前，以色列人都聚集到所罗门王那里。
{1Ki 8:3}   And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
{1Ki 8:3}   以色列长老来到，祭司便抬起约柜，
{1Ki 8:4}   And they brought up the ark of the LORD, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up.
{1Ki 8:4}   祭司和利未人将耶和华的约柜运上来，又将会幕和会幕的一切圣器具都带上来。
{1Ki 8:5}   And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.
{1Ki 8:5}   所罗门王和聚集到他那里的以色列全会众，一同在约柜前献牛羊为祭，多得不可胜数。
{1Ki 8:6}   Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.
{1Ki 8:6}   祭司将耶和华的约柜抬进内殿，就是至圣所，放在两个基路伯的翅膀底下。
{1Ki 8:7}   For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles.
{1Ki 8:7}   基路伯张着翅膀在约柜之上，遮掩约柜和抬柜的杠。
{1Ki 8:8}   And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.
{1Ki 8:8}   这杠甚长，杠头在内殿前的圣所可以看见，在殿外却不能看见，直到如今还在那里。
{1Ki 8:9}   There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
{1Ki 8:9}   约柜里惟有两块石版，就是以色列人出埃及地后，耶和华与他们立约的时候摩西在何烈山所放的。除此以外，并无别物。
{1Ki 8:10}  And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, a cloud filled the house of the LORD,
{1Ki 8:10}  祭司从圣所出来的时候，有云充满耶和华的殿；
{1Ki 8:11}  so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.
{1Ki 8:11}  甚至祭司不能站立供职，因为耶和华的荣光充满了殿。
{1Ki 8:12}  Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.
{1Ki 8:12}  那时所罗门说：耶和华曾说，他必住在幽暗之处。
{1Ki 8:13}  I have indeed built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever."
{1Ki 8:13}  我已经建造殿宇作你的居所，为你永远的住处。
{1Ki 8:14}  Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.
{1Ki 8:14}  王转脸为以色列会众祝福，以色列会众就都站立。
{1Ki 8:15}  And he said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying,
{1Ki 8:15}  所罗门说：“耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的！因他亲口向我父大卫所应许的，也亲手成就了。
{1Ki 8:16}  'Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there. But I chose David to be over my people Israel.'
{1Ki 8:16}  他说：‘自从我领我民以色列出埃及以来，我未曾在以色列各支派中选择一城建造殿宇为我名的居所，但拣选大卫治理我民以色列。’”
{1Ki 8:17}  Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
{1Ki 8:17}  所罗门说：“我父大卫曾立意，要为耶和华以色列神的名建殿。
{1Ki 8:18}  But the LORD said to David my father, 'Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.
{1Ki 8:18}  耶和华却对我父大卫说：‘你立意为我的名建殿，这意思甚好。
{1Ki 8:19}  Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.'
{1Ki 8:19}  只是你不可建殿，惟你所生的儿子必为我名建殿。’
{1Ki 8:20}  Now the LORD has fulfilled his promise that he made. For I have risen in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and I have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
{1Ki 8:20}  现在耶和华成就了他所应许的话，使我接续我父大卫坐以色列的国位，又为耶和华以色列神的名建造了殿。
{1Ki 8:21}  And there I have provided a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt."
{1Ki 8:21}  我也在其中为约柜预备一处。约柜内有耶和华的约，就是他领我们列祖出埃及地的时候，与他们所立的约。”
{1Ki 8:22}  Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven,
{1Ki 8:22}  所罗门当着以色列会众，站在耶和华的坛前，向天举手说：
{1Ki 8:23}  and said, "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart;
{1Ki 8:23}  “耶和华以色列的神啊，天上地下没有神可比你的！你向那尽心行在你面前的仆人守约施慈爱；
{1Ki 8:24}  you have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him. You spoke with your mouth, and with your hand have fulfilled it this day.
{1Ki 8:24}  向你仆人我父大卫所应许的话现在应验了。你亲口应许，亲手成就，正如今日一样。
{1Ki 8:25}  Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.'
{1Ki 8:25}  耶和华以色列的神啊，你所应许你仆人我父大卫的话说：‘你的子孙若谨慎自己的行为，在我面前行事像你所行的一样，就不断人坐以色列的国位。’现在求你应验这话。
{1Ki 8:26}  Now therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David my father.
{1Ki 8:26}  以色列的神啊，求你成就向你仆人我父大卫所应许的话。
{1Ki 8:27}  "But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built!
{1Ki 8:27}  “神果真住在地上吗？看哪，天和天上的天尚且不足你居住的，何况我所建的这殿呢？
{1Ki 8:28}  Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O LORD my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you this day,
{1Ki 8:28}  惟求耶和华我的神垂顾仆人的祷告祈求，俯听仆人今日在你面前的祈祷呼吁。
{1Ki 8:29}  that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you have said, 'My name shall be there,' that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place.
{1Ki 8:29}  愿你昼夜看顾这殿，就是你应许立为你名的居所；求你垂听仆人向此处祷告的话。
{1Ki 8:30}  And listen to the plea of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen in heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.
{1Ki 8:30}  你仆人和你民以色列向此处祈祷的时候，求你在天上你的居所垂听，垂听而赦免。
{1Ki 8:31}  "If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath and comes and swears his oath before your altar in this house,
{1Ki 8:31}  “人若得罪邻舍，有人叫他起誓，他来到这殿在你的坛前起誓，
{1Ki 8:32}  then hear in heaven and act and judge your servants, condemning the guilty by bringing his conduct on his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
{1Ki 8:32}  求你在天上垂听，判断你的仆人：定恶人有罪，照他所行的报应在他头上；定义人有理，照他的义赏赐他。
{1Ki 8:33}  "When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and if they turn again to you and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this house,
{1Ki 8:33}  “你的民以色列若得罪你，败在仇敌面前，又归向你，承认你的名，在这殿里祈求祷告，
{1Ki 8:34}  then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave to their fathers.
{1Ki 8:34}  求你在天上垂听，赦免你民以色列的罪，使他们归回你赐给他们列祖之地。
{1Ki 8:35}  "When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you afflict them,
{1Ki 8:35}  “你的民因得罪你，你惩罚他们，使天闭塞不下雨；他们若向此处祷告，承认你的名，离开他们的罪，
{1Ki 8:36}  then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk, and grant rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.
{1Ki 8:36}  求你在天上垂听，赦免你仆人以色列民的罪，将当行的善道指教他们，且降雨在你的地，就是你赐给你民为业之地。
{1Ki 8:37}  "If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar, if their enemy besieges them in the land at their gates, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,
{1Ki 8:37}  “国中若有饥荒、瘟疫、旱风、霉烂、蝗虫、蚂蚱，或有仇敌犯境围困城邑，无论遭遇什么灾祸疾病，
{1Ki 8:38}  whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart and stretching out his hands toward this house,
{1Ki 8:38}  你的民以色列，或是众人，或是一人，自觉有罪（原文作灾），向这殿举手，无论祈求什么，祷告什么，
{1Ki 8:39}  then hear in heaven your dwelling place and forgive and act and render to each whose heart you know, according to all his ways (for you, you only, know the hearts of all the children of mankind),
{1Ki 8:39}  求你在天上你的居所垂听赦免。你是知道人心的，要照各人所行的待他们（惟有你知道世人的心），
{1Ki 8:40}  that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our fathers.
{1Ki 8:40}  使他们在你赐给我们列祖之地上一生一世敬畏你。
{1Ki 8:41}  "Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a far country for your name's sake
{1Ki 8:41}  “论到不属你民以色列的外邦人，为你名从远方而来，
{1Ki 8:42}  (for they shall hear of your great name and your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm), when he comes and prays toward this house,
{1Ki 8:42}  （他们听人论说你的大名和大能的手，并伸出来的膀臂）向这殿祷告，
{1Ki 8:43}  hear in heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house that I have built is called by your name.
{1Ki 8:43}  求你在天上你的居所垂听，照着外邦人所祈求的而行，使天下万民都认识你的名，敬畏你像你的民以色列一样；又使他们知道我建造的这殿是称为你名下的。
{1Ki 8:44}  "If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to the LORD toward the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,
{1Ki 8:44}  “你的民若奉你的差遣，无论往何处去与仇敌争战，向耶和华所选择的城与我为你名所建造的殿祷告，
{1Ki 8:45}  then hear in heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.
{1Ki 8:45}  求你在天上垂听他们的祷告祈求，使他们得胜。
{1Ki 8:46}  "If they sin against you--for there is no one who does not sin--and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near,
{1Ki 8:46}  “你的民若得罪你（世上没有不犯罪的人），你向他们发怒，将他们交给仇敌掳到仇敌之地，或远或近，
{1Ki 8:47}  yet if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captors, saying, 'We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly,'
{1Ki 8:47}  他们若在掳到之地想起罪来，回心转意，恳求你说：‘我们有罪了，我们悖逆了，我们作恶了’；
{1Ki 8:48}  if they repent with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name,
{1Ki 8:48}  他们若在掳到之地尽心尽性归服你，又向自己的地，就是你赐给他们列祖之地和你所选择的城，并我为你名所建造的殿祷告，
{1Ki 8:49}  then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause
{1Ki 8:49}  求你在天上你的居所垂听他们的祷告祈求，为他们伸冤；
{1Ki 8:50}  and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions that they have committed against you, and grant them compassion in the sight of those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them
{1Ki 8:50}  饶恕得罪你的民，赦免他们的一切过犯，使他们在掳他们的人面前蒙怜恤。
{1Ki 8:51}  (for they are your people, and your heritage, which you brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace).
{1Ki 8:51}  因为他们是你的子民，你的产业，是你从埃及领出来脱离铁炉的。
{1Ki 8:52}  Let your eyes be open to the plea of your servant and to the plea of your people Israel, giving ear to them whenever they call to you.
{1Ki 8:52}  愿你的眼目看顾仆人，听你民以色列的祈求，无论何时向你祈求，愿你垂听。
{1Ki 8:53}  For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be your heritage, as you declared through Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD."
{1Ki 8:53}  主耶和华啊，你将他们从地上的万民中分别出来作你的产业，是照你领我们列祖出埃及的时候，藉你仆人摩西所应许的话。”
{1Ki 8:54}  Now as Solomon finished offering all this prayer and plea to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, where he had knelt with hands outstretched toward heaven.
{1Ki 8:54}  所罗门在耶和华的坛前屈膝跪着，向天举手，在耶和华面前祷告祈求已毕，就起来，
{1Ki 8:55}  And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
{1Ki 8:55}  站着，大声为以色列全会众祝福，说：
{1Ki 8:56}  "Blessed be the LORD who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. Not one word has failed of all his good promise, which he spoke by Moses his servant.
{1Ki 8:56}  “耶和华是应当称颂的！因为他照着一切所应许的赐平安给他的民以色列人，凡藉他仆人摩西应许赐福的话，一句都没有落空。
{1Ki 8:57}  The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. May he not leave us or forsake us,
{1Ki 8:57}  愿耶和华我们的神与我们同在，像与我们列祖同在一样，不撇下我们，不丢弃我们，
{1Ki 8:58}  that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his rules, which he commanded our fathers.
{1Ki 8:58}  使我们的心归向他，遵行他的道，谨守他吩咐我们列祖的诫命、律例、典章。
{1Ki 8:59}  Let these words of mine, with which I have pleaded before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, and may he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel, as each day requires,
{1Ki 8:59}  我在耶和华面前祈求的这些话，愿耶和华我们的神昼夜垂念，每日为他仆人与他民以色列伸冤，
{1Ki 8:60}  that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no other.
{1Ki 8:60}  使地上的万民都知道惟独耶和华是神，并无别神。
{1Ki 8:61}  Let your heart therefore be wholly true to the LORD our God, walking in his statutes and keeping his commandments, as at this day."
{1Ki 8:61}  所以你们当向耶和华我们的神存诚实的心，遵行他的律例，谨守他的诫命，至终如今日一样。”
{1Ki 8:62}  Then the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
{1Ki 8:62}  王和以色列众民一同在耶和华面前献祭。
{1Ki 8:63}  Solomon offered as peace offerings to the LORD 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
{1Ki 8:63}  所罗门向耶和华献平安祭，用牛二万二千，羊十二万。这样，王和以色列众民为耶和华的殿行奉献之礼。
{1Ki 8:64}  The same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to receive the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings.
{1Ki 8:64}  当日，王因耶和华殿前的铜坛太小，容不下燔祭、素祭，和平安祭牲的脂油，便将耶和华殿前院子当中分别为圣，在那里献燔祭、素祭，和平安祭牲的脂油。
{1Ki 8:65}  So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days.
{1Ki 8:65}  那时，所罗门和以色列众人，就是从哈马口直到埃及小河所有的以色列人，都聚集成为大会，在耶和华我们的神面前守节七日又七日，共十四日。
{1Ki 8:66}  On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their homes joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown to David his servant and to Israel his people.
{1Ki 8:66}  第八日，王遣散众民；他们都为王祝福。因见耶和华向他仆人大卫和他民以色列所施的一切恩惠，就都心中喜乐，各归各家去了。
{1Ki 9:1}   As soon as Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the king's house and all that Solomon desired to build,
{1Ki 9:1}   所罗门建造耶和华殿和王宫，并一切所愿意建造的都完毕了，
{1Ki 9:2}   the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
{1Ki 9:2}   耶和华就二次向所罗门显现，如先前在基遍向他显现一样，
{1Ki 9:3}   And the LORD said to him, "I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you have made before me. I have consecrated this house that you have built, by putting my name there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.
{1Ki 9:3}   对他说：“你向我所祷告祈求的，我都应允了。我已将你所建的这殿分别为圣，使我的名永远在其中；我的眼、我的心也必常在那里。
{1Ki 9:4}   And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my rules,
{1Ki 9:4}   你若效法你父大卫，存诚实正直的心行在我面前，遵行我一切所吩咐你的，谨守我的律例典章，
{1Ki 9:5}   then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, 'You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.'
{1Ki 9:5}   我就必坚固你的国位在以色列中，直到永远，正如我应许你父大卫说：‘你的子孙必不断人坐以色列的国位。’
{1Ki 9:6}   But if you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,
{1Ki 9:6}   倘若你们和你们的子孙转去不跟从我，不守我指示你们的诫命律例，去事奉敬拜别神，
{1Ki 9:7}   then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight, and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
{1Ki 9:7}   我就必将以色列人从我赐给他们的地上剪除，并且我为己名所分别为圣的殿也必舍弃不顾，使以色列人在万民中作笑谈，被讥诮。
{1Ki 9:8}   And this house will become a heap of ruins. Everyone passing by it will be astonished and will hiss, and they will say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?'
{1Ki 9:8}   这殿虽然甚高，将来经过的人必惊讶、嗤笑，说：‘耶和华为何向这地和这殿如此行呢？’
{1Ki 9:9}   Then they will say, 'Because they abandoned the LORD their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore the LORD has brought all this disaster on them.'"
{1Ki 9:9}   人必回答说：‘是因此地的人离弃领他们列祖出埃及地之耶和华他们的神，去亲近别神，事奉敬拜他，所以耶和华使这一切灾祸临到他们。’”
{1Ki 9:10}  At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house,
{1Ki 9:10}  所罗门建造耶和华殿和王宫，这两所二十年才完毕了。
{1Ki 9:11}  and Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold, as much as he desired, King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
{1Ki 9:11}  推罗王希兰曾照所罗门所要的，资助他香柏木、松木，和金子；所罗门王就把加利利地的二十座城给了希兰。
{1Ki 9:12}  But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, they did not please him.
{1Ki 9:12}  希兰从推罗出来，察看所罗门给他的城邑，就不喜悦，
{1Ki 9:13}  Therefore he said, "What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?" So they are called the land of Cabul to this day.
{1Ki 9:13}  说：“我兄啊，你给我的是什么城邑呢？”他就给这城邑之地起名叫迦步勒，直到今日。
{1Ki 9:14}  Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
{1Ki 9:14}  希兰给所罗门一百二十他连得金子。
{1Ki 9:15}  And this is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon drafted to build the house of the LORD and his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer
{1Ki 9:15}  所罗门王挑取服苦的人，是为建造耶和华的殿、自己的宫、米罗、耶路撒冷的城墙、夏琐、米吉多，并基色。
{1Ki 9:16}  (Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire, and had killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife;
{1Ki 9:16}  先前埃及王法老上来攻取基色，用火焚烧，杀了城内居住的迦南人，将城赐给他女儿所罗门的妻作妆奁。
{1Ki 9:17}  so Solomon rebuilt Gezer) and Lower Beth-horon
{1Ki 9:17}  所罗门建造基色、下伯和仑、
{1Ki 9:18}  and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,
{1Ki 9:18}  巴拉，并国中旷野里的达莫，
{1Ki 9:19}  and all the store cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
{1Ki 9:19}  又建造所有的积货城，并屯车和马兵的城，与耶路撒冷、利巴嫩，以及自己治理的全国中所愿建造的。
{1Ki 9:20}  All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the people of Israel--
{1Ki 9:20}  至于国中所剩下不属以色列人的亚摩利人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人，
{1Ki 9:21}  their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel were unable to devote to destruction--these Solomon drafted to be slaves, and so they are to this day.
{1Ki 9:21}  就是以色列人不能灭尽的，所罗门挑取他们的后裔作服苦的奴仆，直到今日。
{1Ki 9:22}  But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves. They were the soldiers, they were his officials, his commanders, his captains, his chariot commanders and his horsemen.
{1Ki 9:22}  惟有以色列人，所罗门不使他们作奴仆，乃是作他的战士、臣仆、统领、军长、车兵长、马兵长。
{1Ki 9:23}  These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work: 550 who had charge of the people who carried on the work.
{1Ki 9:23}  所罗门有五百五十督工的，监管工人。
{1Ki 9:24}  But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the city of David to her own house that Solomon had built for her. Then he built the Millo.
{1Ki 9:24}  法老的女儿从大卫城搬到所罗门为他建造的宫里。那时，所罗门才建造米罗。
{1Ki 9:25}  Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he built to the LORD, making offerings with it before the LORD. So he finished the house.
{1Ki 9:25}  所罗门每年三次在他为耶和华所筑的坛上献燔祭和平安祭，又在耶和华面前的坛上烧香。这样，他建造殿的工程完毕了。
{1Ki 9:26}  King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
{1Ki 9:26}  所罗门王在以东地红海边，靠近以禄的以旬迦别制造船只。
{1Ki 9:27}  And Hiram sent with the fleet his servants, seamen who were familiar with the sea, together with the servants of Solomon.
{1Ki 9:27}  希兰差遣他的仆人，就是熟悉泛海的船家，与所罗门的仆人一同坐船航海。
{1Ki 9:28}  And they went to Ophir and brought from there gold, 420 talents, and they brought it to King Solomon.
{1Ki 9:28}  他们到了俄斐，从那里得了四百二十他连得金子，运到所罗门王那里。
{1Ki 10:1}  Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with hard questions.
{1Ki 10:1}  示巴女王听见所罗门因耶和华之名所得的名声，就来要用难解的话试问所罗门。
{1Ki 10:2}  She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.
{1Ki 10:2}  跟随他到耶路撒冷的人甚多，又有骆驼驮着香料、宝石，和许多金子。他来见了所罗门王，就把心里所有的对所罗门都说出来。
{1Ki 10:3}  And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her.
{1Ki 10:3}  所罗门王将他所问的都答上了，没有一句不明白、不能答的。
{1Ki 10:4}  And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,
{1Ki 10:4}  示巴女王见所罗门大有智慧，和他所建造的宫室，
{1Ki 10:5}  the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more breath in her.
{1Ki 10:5}  席上的珍馐美味，群臣分列而坐，仆人两旁侍立，以及他们的衣服装饰和酒政的衣服装饰，又见他上耶和华殿的台阶（或作：他在耶和华殿里所献的燔祭），就诧异得神不守舍；
{1Ki 10:6}  And she said to the king, "The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom,
{1Ki 10:6}  对王说：“我在本国里所听见论到你的事和你的智慧实在是真的！
{1Ki 10:7}  but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard.
{1Ki 10:7}  我先不信那些话，及至我来亲眼见了才知道人所告诉我的还不到一半。你的智慧和你的福分越过我所听见的风声。
{1Ki 10:8}  Happy are your men! Happy are your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
{1Ki 10:8}  你的臣子、你的仆人常侍立在你面前听你智慧的话是有福的！
{1Ki 10:9}  Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the LORD loved Israel forever, he has made you king, that you may execute justice and righteousness."
{1Ki 10:9}  耶和华你的神是应当称颂的！他喜悦你，使你坐以色列的国位；因为他永远爱以色列，所以立你作王，使你秉公行义。”
{1Ki 10:10} Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones. Never again came such an abundance of spices as these that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
{1Ki 10:10} 于是，示巴女王将一百二十他连得金子和宝石，与极多的香料，送给所罗门王。他送给王的香料，以后奉来的不再有这样多。
{1Ki 10:11} Moreover, the fleet of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a very great amount of almug wood and precious stones.
{1Ki 10:11} 希兰的船只从俄斐运了金子来，又从俄斐运了许多檀香木（或作：乌木；下同）和宝石来。
{1Ki 10:12} And the king made of the almug wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king's house, also lyres and harps for the singers. No such almug wood has come or been seen to this day.
{1Ki 10:12} 王用檀香木为耶和华殿和王宫做栏杆，又为歌唱的人做琴瑟。以后再没有这样的檀香木进国来，也没有人看见过，直到如今。）
{1Ki 10:13} And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what was given her by the bounty of King Solomon. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants.
{1Ki 10:13} 示巴女王一切所要所求的，所罗门王都送给他，另外照自己的厚意馈送他。于是女王和他臣仆转回本国去了。
{1Ki 10:14} Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,
{1Ki 10:14} 所罗门每年所得的金子共有六百六十六他连得。
{1Ki 10:15} besides that which came from the explorers and from the business of the merchants, and from all the kings of the west and from the governors of the land.
{1Ki 10:15} 另外还有商人和杂族（杂族在历代下九章十四节是亚拉伯）的诸王，与国中的省长所进的金子。
{1Ki 10:16} King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of gold went into each shield.
{1Ki 10:16} 所罗门王用锤出来的金子打成挡牌二百面，每面用金子六百舍客勒；
{1Ki 10:17} And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
{1Ki 10:17} 又用锤出来的金子打成盾牌三百面，每面用金子三弥那，都放在利巴嫩林宫里。
{1Ki 10:18} The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with the finest gold.
{1Ki 10:18} 王用象牙制造一个宝座，用精金包裹。
{1Ki 10:19} The throne had six steps, and the throne had a round top, and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests,
{1Ki 10:19} 宝座有六层台阶，座的后背是圆的，两旁有扶手，靠近扶手有两个狮子站立。
{1Ki 10:20} while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom.
{1Ki 10:20} 六层台阶上有十二个狮子站立，每层有两个：左边一个，右边一个；在列国中没有这样做的。
{1Ki 10:21} All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.
{1Ki 10:21} 所罗门王一切的饮器都是金子的。利巴嫩林宫里的一切器皿都是精金的。所罗门年间，银子算不了什么。
{1Ki 10:22} For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
{1Ki 10:22} 因为王有他施船只与希兰的船只一同航海，三年一次，装载金银、象牙、猿猴、孔雀回来。
{1Ki 10:23} Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
{1Ki 10:23} 所罗门王的财宝与智慧胜过天下的列王。
{1Ki 10:24} And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.
{1Ki 10:24} 普天下的王都求见所罗门，要听神赐给他智慧的话。
{1Ki 10:25} Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
{1Ki 10:25} 他们各带贡物，就是金器、银器、衣服、军械、香料、骡马，每年有一定之例。
{1Ki 10:26} And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
{1Ki 10:26} 所罗门聚集战车马兵，有战车一千四百辆，马兵一万二千名，安置在屯车的城邑和耶路撒冷，就是王那里。
{1Ki 10:27} And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.
{1Ki 10:27} 王在耶路撒冷使银子多如石头，香柏木多如高原的桑树。
{1Ki 10:28} And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's traders received them from Kue at a price.
{1Ki 10:28} 所罗门的马是从埃及带来的，是王的商人一群一群按着定价买来的。
{1Ki 10:29} A chariot could be imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver and a horse for 150, and so through the king's traders they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
{1Ki 10:29} 从埃及买来的车，每辆价银六百舍客勒，马每匹一百五十舍客勒。赫人诸王和亚兰诸王所买的车马，也是按这价值经他们手买来的。
{1Ki 11:1}  Now King Solomon loved many foreign women, along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women,
{1Ki 11:1}  所罗门王在法老的女儿之外，又宠爱许多外邦女子，就是摩押女子、亚扪女子、以东女子、西顿女子、赫人女子。
{1Ki 11:2}  from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the people of Israel, "You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods." Solomon clung to these in love.
{1Ki 11:2}  论到这些国的人，耶和华曾晓谕以色列人说：“你们不可与他们往来相通，因为他们必诱惑你们的心去随从他们的神。”所罗门却恋爱这些女子。
{1Ki 11:3}  He had 700 wives, who were princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives turned away his heart.
{1Ki 11:3}  所罗门有妃七百，都是公主；还有嫔三百。这些妃嫔诱惑他的心。
{1Ki 11:4}  For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.
{1Ki 11:4}  所罗门年老的时候，他的妃嫔诱惑他的心去随从别神，不效法他父亲大卫诚诚实实地顺服耶和华他的神。
{1Ki 11:5}  For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
{1Ki 11:5}  因为所罗门随从西顿人的女神亚斯他录和亚扪人可憎的神米勒公。
{1Ki 11:6}  So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and did not wholly follow the LORD, as David his father had done.
{1Ki 11:6}  所罗门行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，不效法他父亲大卫专心顺从耶和华。
{1Ki 11:7}  Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem.
{1Ki 11:7}  所罗门为摩押可憎的神基抹和亚扪人可憎的神摩洛，在耶路撒冷对面的山上建筑邱坛。
{1Ki 11:8}  And so he did for all his foreign wives, who made offerings and sacrificed to their gods.
{1Ki 11:8}  他为那些向自己的神烧香献祭的外邦女子，就是他娶来的妃嫔也是这样行。
{1Ki 11:9}  And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice
{1Ki 11:9}  耶和华向所罗门发怒，因为他的心偏离向他两次显现的耶和华以色列的神。
{1Ki 11:10} and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep what the LORD commanded.
{1Ki 11:10} 耶和华曾吩咐他不可随从别神，他却没有遵守耶和华所吩咐的。
{1Ki 11:11} Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this has been your practice and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant.
{1Ki 11:11} 所以耶和华对他说：“你既行了这事，不遵守我所吩咐你守的约和律例，我必将你的国夺回，赐给你的臣子。
{1Ki 11:12} Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
{1Ki 11:12} 然而，因你父亲大卫的缘故，我不在你活着的日子行这事，必从你儿子的手中将国夺回。
{1Ki 11:13} However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem that I have chosen."
{1Ki 11:13} 只是我不将全国夺回，要因我仆人大卫和我所选择的耶路撒冷，还留一支派给你的儿子。”
{1Ki 11:14} And the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was of the royal house in Edom.
{1Ki 11:14} 耶和华使以东人哈达兴起，作所罗门的敌人；他是以东王的后裔。
{1Ki 11:15} For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, he struck down every male in Edom
{1Ki 11:15} 先前大卫攻击以东，元帅约押上去葬埋阵亡的人，将以东的男丁都杀了。
{1Ki 11:16} (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom).
{1Ki 11:16} 约押和以色列众人在以东住了六个月，直到将以东的男丁尽都剪除。
{1Ki 11:17} But Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain Edomites of his father's servants, Hadad still being a little child.
{1Ki 11:17} 那时哈达还是幼童；他和他父亲的臣仆，几个以东人逃往埃及。
{1Ki 11:18} They set out from Midian and came to Paran and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him an allowance of food and gave him land.
{1Ki 11:18} 他们从米甸起行，到了巴兰；从巴兰带着几个人来到埃及见埃及王法老；法老为他派定粮食，又给他房屋田地。
{1Ki 11:19} And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
{1Ki 11:19} 哈达在法老面前大蒙恩惠，以致法老将王后答比匿的妹子赐他为妻。
{1Ki 11:20} And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.
{1Ki 11:20} 答比匿的妹子给哈达生了一个儿子，名叫基努拔。答比匿使基努拔在法老的宫里断奶，基努拔就与法老的众子一同住在法老的宫里。
{1Ki 11:21} But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let me depart, that I may go to my own country."
{1Ki 11:21} 哈达在埃及听见大卫与他列祖同睡，元帅约押也死了，就对法老说：“求王容我回本国去。”
{1Ki 11:22} But Pharaoh said to him, "What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country?" And he said to him, "Only let me depart."
{1Ki 11:22} 法老对他说：“你在我这里有什么缺乏，你竟要回你本国去呢？”他回答说：“我没有缺乏什么，只是求王容我回去。”
{1Ki 11:23} God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah.
{1Ki 11:23} 神又使以利亚大的儿子利逊兴起，作所罗门的敌人。他先前逃避主人琐巴王哈大底谢。
{1Ki 11:24} And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, after the killing by David. And they went to Damascus and lived there and made him king in Damascus.
{1Ki 11:24} 大卫击杀琐巴人的时候，利逊招聚了一群人，自己作他们的头目，往大马色居住，在那里作王。
{1Ki 11:25} He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing harm as Hadad did. And he loathed Israel and reigned over Syria.
{1Ki 11:25} 所罗门活着的时候，哈达为患之外，利逊也作以色列的敌人。他恨恶以色列人，且作了亚兰人的王。
{1Ki 11:26} Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king.
{1Ki 11:26} 所罗门的臣仆、尼八的儿子耶罗波安也举手攻击王。他是以法莲支派的洗利达人，他母亲是寡妇，名叫洗鲁阿。
{1Ki 11:27} And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father.
{1Ki 11:27} 他举手攻击王的缘故，乃由先前所罗门建造米罗，修补他父亲大卫城的破口。
{1Ki 11:28} The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.
{1Ki 11:28} 耶罗波安是大有才能的人。所罗门见这少年人殷勤，就派他监管约瑟家的一切工程。
{1Ki 11:29} And at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had dressed himself in a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the open country.
{1Ki 11:29} 一日，耶罗波安出了耶路撒冷，示罗人先知亚希雅在路上遇见他；亚希雅身上穿着一件新衣。他们二人在田野，以外并无别人。
{1Ki 11:30} Then Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces.
{1Ki 11:30} 亚希雅将自己穿的那件新衣撕成十二片，
{1Ki 11:31} And he said to Jeroboam, "Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you ten tribes
{1Ki 11:31} 对耶罗波安说：“你可以拿十片。耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘我必将国从所罗门手里夺回，将十个支派赐给你。
{1Ki 11:32} (but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),
{1Ki 11:32} （我因仆人大卫和我在以色列众支派中所选择的耶路撒冷城的缘故，仍给所罗门留一个支派。）
{1Ki 11:33} because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and they have not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my rules, as David his father did.
{1Ki 11:33} 因为他离弃我，敬拜西顿人的女神亚斯他录、摩押的神基抹，和亚扪人的神米勒公，没有遵从我的道，行我眼中看为正的事，守我的律例典章，像他父亲大卫一样。
{1Ki 11:34} Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes.
{1Ki 11:34} 但我不从他手里将全国夺回；使他终身为君，是因我所拣选的仆人大卫谨守我的诫命律例。
{1Ki 11:35} But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give it to you, ten tribes.
{1Ki 11:35} 我必从他儿子的手里将国夺回，以十个支派赐给你，
{1Ki 11:36} Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name.
{1Ki 11:36} 还留一个支派给他的儿子，使我仆人大卫在我所选择立我名的耶路撒冷城里，在我面前长有灯光。
{1Ki 11:37} And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.
{1Ki 11:37} 我必拣选你，使你照心里一切所愿的，作王治理以色列。
{1Ki 11:38} And if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.
{1Ki 11:38} 你若听从我一切所吩咐你的，遵行我的道，行我眼中看为正的事，谨守我的律例诫命，像我仆人大卫所行的，我就与你同在，为你立坚固的家，像我为大卫所立的一样，将以色列人赐给你。
{1Ki 11:39} And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this, but not forever.'"
{1Ki 11:39} 我必因所罗门所行的使大卫后裔受患难，但不至于永远。’”
{1Ki 11:40} Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
{1Ki 11:40} 所罗门因此想要杀耶罗波安。耶罗波安却起身逃往埃及；到了埃及王示撒那里，就住在埃及，直到所罗门死了。
{1Ki 11:41} Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?
{1Ki 11:41} 所罗门其余的事，凡他所行的和他的智慧都写在所罗门记上。
{1Ki 11:42} And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
{1Ki 11:42} 所罗门在耶路撒冷作以色列众人的王共四十年。
{1Ki 11:43} And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
{1Ki 11:43} 所罗门与他列祖同睡，葬在他父亲大卫的城里。他儿子罗波安接续他作王。
{1Ki 12:1}  Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
{1Ki 12:1}  罗波安往示剑去；因为以色列人都到了示剑要立他作王。
{1Ki 12:2}  And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
{1Ki 12:2}  尼八的儿子耶罗波安先前躲避所罗门王，逃往埃及，住在那里（他听见这事。）
{1Ki 12:3}  And they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam,
{1Ki 12:3}  以色列人打发人去请他来，他就和以色列会众都来见罗波安，对他说：
{1Ki 12:4}  "Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you."
{1Ki 12:4}  “你父亲使我们负重轭，做苦工，现在求你使我们做的苦工、负的重轭轻松些，我们就事奉你。”
{1Ki 12:5}  He said to them, "Go away for three days, then come again to me." So the people went away.
{1Ki 12:5}  罗波安对他们说：“你们暂且去，第三日再来见我。”民就去了。
{1Ki 12:6}  Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, "How do you advise me to answer this people?"
{1Ki 12:6}  罗波安之父所罗门在世的日子，有侍立在他面前的老年人，罗波安王和他们商议，说：“你们给我出个什么主意，我好回覆这民。”
{1Ki 12:7}  And they said to him, "If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever."
{1Ki 12:7}  老年人对他说：“现在王若服事这民如仆人，用好话回答他们，他们就永远作王的仆人。”
{1Ki 12:8}  But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.
{1Ki 12:8}  王却不用老年人给他出的主意，就和那些与他一同长大、在他面前侍立的少年人商议，
{1Ki 12:9}  And he said to them, "What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?"
{1Ki 12:9}  说：“这民对我说：‘你父亲使我们负重轭，求你使我们轻松些。’你们给我出个什么主意，我好回覆他们。”
{1Ki 12:10} And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, "Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us,' thus shall you say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs.
{1Ki 12:10} 那同他长大的少年人说：“这民对王说：‘你父亲使我们负重轭，求你使我们轻松些。’王要对他们如此说：‘我的小拇指头比我父亲的腰还粗。
{1Ki 12:11} And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'"
{1Ki 12:11} 我父亲使你们负重轭，我必使你们负更重的轭！我父亲用鞭子责打你们，我要用蝎子鞭责打你们！’”
{1Ki 12:12} So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, "Come to me again the third day."
{1Ki 12:12} 耶罗波安和众百姓遵着罗波安王所说“你们第三日再来见我”的那话，第三日他们果然来了。
{1Ki 12:13} And the king answered the people harshly, and forsaking the counsel that the old men had given him,
{1Ki 12:13} 王用严厉的话回答百姓，不用老年人给他所出的主意，
{1Ki 12:14} he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."
{1Ki 12:14} 照着少年人所出的主意对民说：“我父亲使你们负重轭，我必使你们负更重的轭！我父亲用鞭子责打你们，我要用蝎子鞭责打你们！”
{1Ki 12:15} So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by the LORD that he might fulfill his word, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
{1Ki 12:15} 王不肯依从百姓，这事乃出于耶和华，为要应验他藉示罗人亚希雅对尼八的儿子耶罗波安所说的话。
{1Ki 12:16} And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, "What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David." So Israel went to their tents.
{1Ki 12:16} 以色列众民见王不依从他们，就对王说：我们与大卫有什么分儿呢？与耶西的儿子并没有关涉。以色列人哪，各回各家去吧！大卫家啊，自己顾自己吧！于是，以色列人都回自己家里去了，
{1Ki 12:17} But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.
{1Ki 12:17} 惟独住犹大城邑的以色列人，罗波安仍作他们的王。
{1Ki 12:18} Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
{1Ki 12:18} 罗波安王差遣掌管服苦之人的亚多兰往以色列人那里去，以色列人就用石头打死他。罗波安王急忙上车，逃回耶路撒冷去了。
{1Ki 12:19} So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
{1Ki 12:19} 这样，以色列人背叛大卫家，直到今日。
{1Ki 12:20} And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David but the tribe of Judah only.
{1Ki 12:20} 以色列众人听见耶罗波安回来了，就打发人去请他到会众面前，立他作以色列众人的王。除了犹大支派以外，没有顺从大卫家的。
{1Ki 12:21} When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
{1Ki 12:21} 罗波安来到耶路撒冷，招聚犹大全家和便雅悯支派的人共十八万，都是挑选的战士，要与以色列家争战，好将国夺回，再归所罗门的儿子罗波安。
{1Ki 12:22} But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:
{1Ki 12:22} 但神的话临到神人示玛雅，说：
{1Ki 12:23} "Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,
{1Ki 12:23} “你去告诉所罗门的儿子犹大王罗波安和犹大、便雅悯全家，并其余的民说：
{1Ki 12:24} 'Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives the people of Israel. Every man return to his home, for this thing is from me.'" So they listened to the word of the LORD and went home again, according to the word of the LORD.
{1Ki 12:24} ‘耶和华如此说：你们不可上去与你们的弟兄以色列人争战。各归各家去吧！因为这事出于我。’”众人就听从耶和华的话，遵着耶和华的命回去了。
{1Ki 12:25} Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And he went out from there and built Penuel.
{1Ki 12:25} 耶罗波安在以法莲山地建筑示剑，就住在其中；又从示剑出去，建筑毗努伊勒。
{1Ki 12:26} And Jeroboam said in his heart, "Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David.
{1Ki 12:26} 耶罗波安心里说：“恐怕这国仍归大卫家；
{1Ki 12:27} If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the temple of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah."
{1Ki 12:27} 这民若上耶路撒冷去，在耶和华的殿里献祭，他们的心必归向他们的主犹大王罗波安，就把我杀了，仍归犹大王罗波安。”
{1Ki 12:28} So the king took counsel and made two calves of gold. And he said to the people, "You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."
{1Ki 12:28} 耶罗波安王就筹划定妥，铸造了两个金牛犊，对众民说：“以色列人哪，你们上耶路撒冷去实在是难；这就是领你们出埃及地的神。”
{1Ki 12:29} And he set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.
{1Ki 12:29} 他就把牛犊一只安在伯特利，一只安在但。
{1Ki 12:30} Then this thing became a sin, for the people went as far as Dan to be before one.
{1Ki 12:30} 这事叫百姓陷在罪里，因为他们往但去拜那牛犊。
{1Ki 12:31} He also made temples on high places and appointed priests from among all the people, who were not of the Levites.
{1Ki 12:31} 耶罗波安在邱坛那里建殿，将那不属利未人的凡民立为祭司。
{1Ki 12:32} And Jeroboam appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar. So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.
{1Ki 12:32} 耶罗波安定八月十五日为节期，像在犹大的节期一样，自己上坛献祭。他在伯特利也这样向他所铸的牛犊献祭，又将立为邱坛的祭司安置在伯特利。
{1Ki 12:33} He went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month that he had devised from his own heart. And he instituted a feast for the people of Israel and went up to the altar to make offerings.
{1Ki 12:33} 他在八月十五日，就是他私自所定的月日，为以色列人立作节期的日子，在伯特利上坛烧香。
{1Ki 13:1}  And behold, a man of God came out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel. Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make offerings.
{1Ki 13:1}  那时，有一个神人奉耶和华的命从犹大来到伯特利。耶罗波安正站在坛旁要烧香；
{1Ki 13:2}  And the man cried against the altar by the word of the LORD and said, "O altar, altar, thus says the LORD: 'Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who make offerings on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.'"
{1Ki 13:2}  神人奉耶和华的命向坛呼叫，说：“坛哪，坛哪！耶和华如此说：大卫家里必生一个儿子，名叫约西亚，他必将邱坛的祭司，就是在你上面烧香的，杀在你上面，人的骨头也必烧在你上面。”
{1Ki 13:3}  And he gave a sign the same day, saying, "This is the sign that the LORD has spoken: 'Behold, the altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.'"
{1Ki 13:3}  当日，神人设个预兆，说：“这坛必破裂，坛上的灰必倾撒，这是耶和华说的预兆。”
{1Ki 13:4}  And when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, "Seize him." And his hand, which he stretched out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself.
{1Ki 13:4}  耶罗波安王听见神人向伯特利的坛所呼叫的话，就从坛上伸手，说：“拿住他吧！”王向神人所伸的手就枯干了，不能弯回；
{1Ki 13:5}  The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
{1Ki 13:5}  坛也破裂了，坛上的灰倾撒了，正如神人奉耶和华的命所设的预兆。
{1Ki 13:6}  And the king said to the man of God, "Entreat now the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me." And the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him and became as it was before.
{1Ki 13:6}  王对神人说：“请你为我祷告，求耶和华你神的恩典使我的手复原。”于是神人祈祷耶和华，王的手就复了原，仍如寻常一样。
{1Ki 13:7}  And the king said to the man of God, "Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward."
{1Ki 13:7}  王对神人说：“请你同我回去吃饭，加添心力，我也必给你赏赐。”
{1Ki 13:8}  And the man of God said to the king, "If you give me half your house, I will not go in with you. And I will not eat bread or drink water in this place,
{1Ki 13:8}  神人对王说：“你就是把你的宫一半给我，我也不同你进去，也不在这地方吃饭喝水；
{1Ki 13:9}  for so was it commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'You shall neither eat bread nor drink water nor return by the way that you came.'"
{1Ki 13:9}  因为有耶和华的话嘱咐我，说不可在伯特利吃饭喝水，也不可从你去的原路回来。”
{1Ki 13:10} So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.
{1Ki 13:10} 于是神人从别的路回去，不从伯特利来的原路回去。
{1Ki 13:11} Now an old prophet lived in Bethel. And his sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told to their father the words that he had spoken to the king.
{1Ki 13:11} 有一个老先知住在伯特利，他儿子们来，将神人当日在伯特利所行的一切事和向王所说的话都告诉了父亲。
{1Ki 13:12} And their father said to them, "Which way did he go?" And his sons showed him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone.
{1Ki 13:12} 父亲问他们说：“神人从那条路去了呢？”儿子们就告诉他；原来他们看见那从犹大来的神人所去的路。
{1Ki 13:13} And he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled the donkey for him and he mounted it.
{1Ki 13:13} 老先知就吩咐他儿子们说：“你们为我备驴。”他们备好了驴，他就骑上，
{1Ki 13:14} And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" And he said, "I am."
{1Ki 13:14} 去追赶神人，遇见他坐在橡树底下，就问他说：“你是从犹大来的神人不是？”他说：“是。”
{1Ki 13:15} Then he said to him, "Come home with me and eat bread."
{1Ki 13:15} 老先知对他说：“请你同我回家吃饭。”
{1Ki 13:16} And he said, "I may not return with you, or go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place,
{1Ki 13:16} 神人说：“我不可同你回去进你的家，也不可在这里同你吃饭喝水；
{1Ki 13:17} for it was said to me by the word of the LORD, 'You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came.'"
{1Ki 13:17} 因为有耶和华的话嘱咐我说：‘你在那里不可吃饭喝水，也不可从你去的原路回来。’”
{1Ki 13:18} And he said to him, "I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water.'" But he lied to him.
{1Ki 13:18} 老先知对他说：“我也是先知，和你一样。有天使奉耶和华的命对我说：‘你去把他带回你的家，叫他吃饭喝水。’”这都是老先知诓哄他。
{1Ki 13:19} So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.
{1Ki 13:19} 于是神人同老先知回去，在他家里吃饭喝水。
{1Ki 13:20} And as they sat at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back.
{1Ki 13:20} 二人坐席的时候，耶和华的话临到那带神人回来的先知，
{1Ki 13:21} And he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD and have not kept the command that the LORD your God commanded you,
{1Ki 13:21} 他就对那从犹大来的神人说：“耶和华如此说：你既违背耶和华的话，不遵守耶和华你神的命令，
{1Ki 13:22} but have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, "Eat no bread and drink no water," your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.'"
{1Ki 13:22} 反倒回来，在耶和华禁止你吃饭喝水的地方吃了喝了，因此你的尸身不得入你列祖的坟墓。”
{1Ki 13:23} And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.
{1Ki 13:23} 吃喝完了，老先知为所带回来的先知备驴。
{1Ki 13:24} And as he went away a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his body was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body.
{1Ki 13:24} 他就去了，在路上有个狮子遇见他，将他咬死，尸身倒在路上，驴站在尸身旁边，狮子也站在尸身旁边。
{1Ki 13:25} And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown in the road and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.
{1Ki 13:25} 有人从那里经过，看见尸身倒在路上，狮子站在尸身旁边，就来到老先知所住的城里述说这事。
{1Ki 13:26} And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, "It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the LORD; therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word that the LORD spoke to him."
{1Ki 13:26} 那带神人回来的先知听见这事，就说：“这是那违背了耶和华命令的神人，所以耶和华把他交给狮子；狮子抓伤他，咬死他，是应验耶和华对他说的话。”
{1Ki 13:27} And he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." And they saddled it.
{1Ki 13:27} 老先知就吩咐他儿子们说：“你们为我备驴。”他们就备了驴。
{1Ki 13:28} And he went and found his body thrown in the road, and the donkey and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or torn the donkey.
{1Ki 13:28} 他去了，看见神人的尸身倒在路上，驴和狮子站在尸身旁边，狮子却没有吃尸身，也没有抓伤驴。
{1Ki 13:29} And the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back to the city to mourn and to bury him.
{1Ki 13:29} 老先知就把神人的尸身驮在驴上，带回自己的城里，要哀哭他，葬埋他；
{1Ki 13:30} And he laid the body in his own grave. And they mourned over him, saying, "Alas, my brother!"
{1Ki 13:30} 就把他的尸身葬在自己的坟墓里，哀哭他，说：“哀哉！我兄啊。”
{1Ki 13:31} And after he had buried him, he said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
{1Ki 13:31} 安葬之后，老先知对他儿子们说：“我死了，你们要葬我在神人的坟墓里，使我的尸骨靠近他的尸骨，
{1Ki 13:32} For the saying that he called out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to pass."
{1Ki 13:32} 因为他奉耶和华的命指着伯特利的坛和撒玛利亚各城有邱坛之殿所说的话必定应验。”
{1Ki 13:33} After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made priests for the high places again from among all the people. Any who would, he ordained to be priests of the high places.
{1Ki 13:33} 这事以后，耶罗波安仍不离开他的恶道，将凡民立为邱坛的祭司；凡愿意的，他都分别为圣，立为邱坛的祭司。
{1Ki 13:34} And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth.
{1Ki 13:34} 这事叫耶罗波安的家陷在罪里，甚至他的家从地上除灭了。
{1Ki 14:1}  At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
{1Ki 14:1}  那时，耶罗波安的儿子亚比雅病了。
{1Ki 14:2}  And Jeroboam said to his wife, "Arise, and disguise yourself, that it not be known that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who said of me that I should be king over this people.
{1Ki 14:2}  耶罗波安对他的妻说：“你可以起来改装，使人不知道你是耶罗波安的妻，往示罗去，在那里有先知亚希雅。他曾告诉我说，你必作这民的王。
{1Ki 14:3}  Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what shall happen to the child."
{1Ki 14:3}  现在你要带十个饼，与几个薄饼，和一瓶蜜去见他，他必告诉你儿子将要怎样。”
{1Ki 14:4}  Jeroboam's wife did so. She arose and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.
{1Ki 14:4}  耶罗波安的妻就这样行，起身往示罗去，到了亚希雅的家。亚希雅因年纪老迈，眼目发直，不能看见。
{1Ki 14:5}  And the LORD said to Ahijah, "Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus shall you say to her." When she came, she pretended to be another woman.
{1Ki 14:5}  耶和华先晓谕亚希雅说：“耶罗波安的妻要来问你，因他儿子病了，你当如此如此告诉他。他进来的时候必装作别的妇人。”
{1Ki 14:6}  But when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with unbearable news for you.
{1Ki 14:6}  他刚进门，亚希雅听见他脚步的响声，就说：“耶罗波安的妻，进来吧！你为何装作别的妇人呢？我奉差遣将凶事告诉你。
{1Ki 14:7}  Go, tell Jeroboam, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: "Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over my people Israel
{1Ki 14:7}  你回去告诉耶罗波安说：‘耶和华以色列的神如此说：我从民中将你高举，立你作我民以色列的君，
{1Ki 14:8}  and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, and yet you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my eyes,
{1Ki 14:8}  将国从大卫家夺回赐给你；你却不效法我仆人大卫，遵守我的诫命，一心顺从我，行我眼中看为正的事。
{1Ki 14:9}  but you have done evil above all who were before you and have gone and made for yourself other gods and metal images, provoking me to anger, and have cast me behind your back,
{1Ki 14:9}  你竟行恶，比那在你以先的更甚，为自己立了别神，铸了偶像，惹我发怒，将我丢在背后。
{1Ki 14:10} therefore behold, I will bring harm upon the house of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will burn up the house of Jeroboam, as a man burns up dung until it is all gone.
{1Ki 14:10} 因此，我必使灾祸临到耶罗波安的家，将属耶罗波安的男丁，无论困住的、自由的都从以色列中剪除，必除尽耶罗波安的家，如人除尽粪土一般。
{1Ki 14:11} Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat, for the LORD has spoken it."'
{1Ki 14:11} 凡属耶罗波安的人，死在城中的必被狗吃，死在田野的必被空中的鸟吃。这是耶和华说的。’
{1Ki 14:12} Arise therefore, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.
{1Ki 14:12} 所以你起身回家去吧！你的脚一进城，你儿子就必死了。
{1Ki 14:13} And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something pleasing to the LORD, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
{1Ki 14:13} 以色列众人必为他哀哭，将他葬埋。凡属耶罗波安的人，惟有他得入坟墓；因为在耶罗波安的家中，只有他向耶和华以色列的神显出善行。
{1Ki 14:14} Moreover, the LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam today. And henceforth,
{1Ki 14:14} 耶和华必另立一王治理以色列。到了日期，他必剪除耶罗波安的家；那日期已经到了。
{1Ki 14:15} the LORD will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water, and root up Israel out of this good land that he gave to their fathers and scatter them beyond the Euphrates, because they have made their Asherim, provoking the LORD to anger.
{1Ki 14:15} 耶和华必击打以色列人，使他们摇动，像水中的芦苇一般；又将他们从耶和华赐给他们列祖的美地上拔出来，分散在大河那边；因为他们做木偶，惹耶和华发怒。
{1Ki 14:16} And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he sinned and made Israel to sin."
{1Ki 14:16} 因耶罗波安所犯的罪，又使以色列人陷在罪里，耶和华必将以色列人交给仇敌。”
{1Ki 14:17} Then Jeroboam's wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah. And as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
{1Ki 14:17} 耶罗波安的妻起身回去，到了得撒，刚到门槛，儿子就死了。
{1Ki 14:18} And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.
{1Ki 14:18} 以色列众人将他葬埋，为他哀哭，正如耶和华藉他仆人先知亚希雅所说的话。
{1Ki 14:19} Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
{1Ki 14:19} 耶罗波安其余的事，他怎样争战，怎样作王，都写在以色列诸王记上。
{1Ki 14:20} And the time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years. And he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.
{1Ki 14:20} 耶罗波安作王二十二年，就与他列祖同睡。他儿子拿答接续他作王。
{1Ki 14:21} Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
{1Ki 14:21} 所罗门的儿子罗波安作犹大王。他登基的时候年四十一岁，在耶路撒冷，就是耶和华从以色列众支派中所选择立他名的城，作王十七年。罗波安的母亲名叫拿玛，是亚扪人。
{1Ki 14:22} And Judah did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins that they committed, more than all that their fathers had done.
{1Ki 14:22} 犹大人行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，犯罪触动他的愤恨，比他们列祖更甚。
{1Ki 14:23} For they also built for themselves high places and pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree,
{1Ki 14:23} 因为他们在各高冈上，各青翠树下筑坛，立柱像和木偶。
{1Ki 14:24} and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations that the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
{1Ki 14:24} 国中也有娈童。犹大人效法耶和华在以色列人面前所赶出的外邦人，行一切可憎恶的事。
{1Ki 14:25} In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.
{1Ki 14:25} 罗波安王第五年，埃及王示撒上来攻取耶路撒冷，
{1Ki 14:26} He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house. He took away everything. He also took away all the shields of gold that Solomon had made,
{1Ki 14:26} 夺了耶和华殿和王宫里的宝物，尽都带走，又夺去所罗门制造的金盾牌。
{1Ki 14:27} and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.
{1Ki 14:27} 罗波安王制造铜盾牌代替那金盾牌，交给守王宫门的护卫长看守。
{1Ki 14:28} And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard carried them and brought them back to the guardroom.
{1Ki 14:28} 王每逢进耶和华的殿，护卫兵就拿这盾牌，随后仍将盾牌送回，放在护卫房。
{1Ki 14:29} Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{1Ki 14:29} 罗波安其余的事，凡他所行的，都写在犹大列王记上。
{1Ki 14:30} And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
{1Ki 14:30} 罗波安与耶罗波安时常争战。
{1Ki 14:31} And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite. And Abijam his son reigned in his place.
{1Ki 14:31} 罗波安与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他母亲名叫拿玛，是亚扪人。他儿子亚比央（又名亚比雅）接续他作王。
{1Ki 15:1}  Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah.
{1Ki 15:1}  尼八的儿子耶罗波安王十八年，亚比央登基作犹大王，
{1Ki 15:2}  He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
{1Ki 15:2}  在耶路撒冷作王三年。他母亲名叫玛迦，是押沙龙的女儿。
{1Ki 15:3}  And he walked in all the sins that his father did before him, and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
{1Ki 15:3}  亚比央行他父亲在他以前所行的一切恶，他的心不像他祖大卫的心，诚诚实实地顺服耶和华他的神。
{1Ki 15:4}  Nevertheless, for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem,
{1Ki 15:4}  然而耶和华他的神因大卫的缘故，仍使他在耶路撒冷有灯光，叫他儿子接续他作王，坚立耶路撒冷。
{1Ki 15:5}  because David did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
{1Ki 15:5}  因为大卫除了赫人乌利亚那件事，都是行耶和华眼中看为正的事，一生没有违背耶和华一切所吩咐的。
{1Ki 15:6}  Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
{1Ki 15:6}  罗波安在世的日子常与耶罗波安争战。
{1Ki 15:7}  The rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
{1Ki 15:7}  亚比央其余的事，凡他所行的，都写在犹大列王记上。亚比央常与耶罗波安争战。
{1Ki 15:8}  And Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place.
{1Ki 15:8}  亚比央与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫的城里。他儿子亚撒接续他作王。
{1Ki 15:9}  In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah,
{1Ki 15:9}  以色列王耶罗波安二十年，亚撒登基作犹大王，
{1Ki 15:10} and he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
{1Ki 15:10} 在耶路撒冷作王四十一年。他祖母名叫玛迦，是押沙龙的女儿。
{1Ki 15:11} And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as David his father had done.
{1Ki 15:11} 亚撒效法他祖大卫行耶和华眼中看为正的事，
{1Ki 15:12} He put away the male cult prostitutes out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
{1Ki 15:12} 从国中除去娈童，又除掉他列祖所造的一切偶像；
{1Ki 15:13} He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother because she had made an abominable image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her image and burned it at the brook Kidron.
{1Ki 15:13} 并且贬了他祖母玛迦太后的位，因他造了可憎的偶像亚舍拉。亚撒砍下他的偶像，烧在汲沦溪边，
{1Ki 15:14} But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was wholly true to the LORD all his days.
{1Ki 15:14} 只是邱坛还没有废去。亚撒一生却向耶和华存诚实的心。
{1Ki 15:15} And he brought into the house of the LORD the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels.
{1Ki 15:15} 亚撒将他父亲所分别为圣与自己所分别为圣的金银和器皿都奉到耶和华的殿里。
{1Ki 15:16} And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
{1Ki 15:16} 亚撒和以色列王巴沙在世的日子常常争战。
{1Ki 15:17} Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
{1Ki 15:17} 以色列王巴沙上来要攻击犹大，修筑拉玛，不许人从犹大王亚撒那里出入。
{1Ki 15:18} Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house and gave them into the hands of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,
{1Ki 15:18} 于是亚撒将耶和华殿和王宫府库里所剩下的金银都交在他臣仆手中，打发他们往住大马色的亚兰王希旬的孙子、他伯利们的儿子便哈达那里去，
{1Ki 15:19} "Let there be a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me."
{1Ki 15:19} 说：“你父曾与我父立约，我与你也要立约。现在我将金银送你为礼物，求你废掉你与以色列王巴沙所立的约，使他离开我。”
{1Ki 15:20} And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
{1Ki 15:20} 便哈达听从亚撒王的话，派军长去攻击以色列的城邑；他们就攻破以云、但、亚伯伯玛迦、基尼烈全境、拿弗他利全境。
{1Ki 15:21} And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and he lived in Tirzah.
{1Ki 15:21} 巴沙听见，就停工不修筑拉玛了，仍住在得撒。
{1Ki 15:22} Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah, none was exempt, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.
{1Ki 15:22} 于是亚撒王宣告犹大众人，不准一个推辞，吩咐他们将巴沙修筑拉玛所用的石头、木头都运去，用以修筑便雅悯的迦巴和米斯巴。
{1Ki 15:23} Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, and all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet.
{1Ki 15:23} 亚撒其余的事，凡他所行的，并他的勇力与他所建筑的城邑，都写在犹大列王记上。亚撒年老的时候，脚上有病。
{1Ki 15:24} And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.
{1Ki 15:24} 亚撒与他列祖同睡，葬在他祖大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子约沙法接续他作王。
{1Ki 15:25} Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.
{1Ki 15:25} 犹大王亚撒第二年，耶罗波安的儿子拿答登基作以色列王共二年，
{1Ki 15:26} He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin which he made Israel to sin.
{1Ki 15:26} 拿答行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，行他父亲所行的，犯他父亲使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。
{1Ki 15:27} Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
{1Ki 15:27} 以萨迦人亚希雅的儿子巴沙背叛拿答，在非利士的基比顿杀了他。那时拿答和以色列众人正围困基比顿。
{1Ki 15:28} So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place.
{1Ki 15:28} 在犹大王亚撒第三年巴沙杀了他，篡了他的位。
{1Ki 15:29} And as soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jeroboam. He left to the house of Jeroboam not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite.
{1Ki 15:29} 巴沙一作王就杀了耶罗波安的全家，凡有气息的没有留下一个，都灭尽了，正应验耶和华藉他仆人示罗人亚希雅所说的话。
{1Ki 15:30} It was for the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned and that he made Israel to sin, and because of the anger to which he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel.
{1Ki 15:30} 这是因为耶罗波安所犯的罪使以色列人陷在罪里，惹动耶和华以色列神的怒气。
{1Ki 15:31} Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{1Ki 15:31} 拿答其余的事，凡他所行的，都写在以色列诸王记上。
{1Ki 15:32} And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
{1Ki 15:32} 亚撒和以色列王巴沙在世的日子常常争战。
{1Ki 15:33} In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel at Tirzah, and he reigned twenty-four years.
{1Ki 15:33} 犹大王亚撒第三年，亚希雅的儿子巴沙在得撒登基作以色列众人的王共二十四年。
{1Ki 15:34} He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel to sin.
{1Ki 15:34} 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，行耶罗波安所行的道，犯他使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。
{1Ki 16:1}  And the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
{1Ki 16:1}  耶和华的话临到哈拿尼的儿子耶户，责备巴沙说：
{1Ki 16:2}  "Since I exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins,
{1Ki 16:2}  “我既从尘埃中提拔你，立你作我民以色列的君，你竟行耶罗波安所行的道，使我民以色列陷在罪里，惹我发怒，
{1Ki 16:3}  behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
{1Ki 16:3}  我必除尽你和你的家，使你的家像尼八的儿子耶罗波安的家一样。
{1Ki 16:4}  Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens shall eat."
{1Ki 16:4}  凡属巴沙的人，死在城中的必被狗吃，死在田野的必被空中的鸟吃。”
{1Ki 16:5}  Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{1Ki 16:5}  巴沙其余的事，凡他所行的和他的勇力，都写在以色列诸王记上。
{1Ki 16:6}  And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried at Tirzah, and Elah his son reigned in his place.
{1Ki 16:6}  巴沙与他列祖同睡，葬在得撒。他儿子以拉接续他作王。
{1Ki 16:7}  Moreover, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and also because he destroyed it.
{1Ki 16:7}  耶和华的话临到哈拿尼的儿子先知耶户，责备巴沙和他的家，因他行耶和华眼中看为恶的一切事，以他手所做的惹耶和华发怒，像耶罗波安的家一样，又因他杀了耶罗波安的全家。
{1Ki 16:8}  In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned two years.
{1Ki 16:8}  犹大王亚撒二十六年，巴沙的儿子以拉在得撒登基作以色列王共二年。
{1Ki 16:9}  But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah,
{1Ki 16:9}  有管理他一半战车的臣子心利背叛他。当他在得撒家宰亚杂家里喝醉的时候，
{1Ki 16:10} Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.
{1Ki 16:10} 心利就进去杀了他，篡了他的位。这是犹大王亚撒二十七年的事。
{1Ki 16:11} When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he struck down all the house of Baasha. He did not leave him a single male of his relatives or his friends.
{1Ki 16:11} 心利一坐王位就杀了巴沙的全家，连他的亲属、朋友也没有留下一个男丁。
{1Ki 16:12} Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
{1Ki 16:12} 心利这样灭绝巴沙的全家，正如耶和华藉先知耶户责备巴沙的话。
{1Ki 16:13} for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and which they made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols.
{1Ki 16:13} 这是因巴沙和他儿子以拉的一切罪，就是他们使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，以虚无的神惹耶和华以色列神的怒气。
{1Ki 16:14} Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{1Ki 16:14} 以拉其余的事，凡他所行的，都写在以色列诸王记上。
{1Ki 16:15} In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines,
{1Ki 16:15} 犹大王亚撒二十七年，心利在得撒作王七日。那时民正安营围攻非利士的基比顿。
{1Ki 16:16} and the troops who were encamped heard it said, "Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king." Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
{1Ki 16:16} 民在营中听说心利背叛，又杀了王，故此以色列众人当日在营中立元帅暗利作以色列王。
{1Ki 16:17} So Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
{1Ki 16:17} 暗利率领以色列众人，从基比顿上去，围困得撒。
{1Ki 16:18} And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king's house and burned the king's house over him with fire and died,
{1Ki 16:18} 心利见城破失，就进了王宫的卫所，放火焚烧宫殿，自焚而死。
{1Ki 16:19} because of his sins that he committed, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and for his sin which he committed, making Israel to sin.
{1Ki 16:19} 这是因他犯罪，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，行耶罗波安所行的，犯他使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。
{1Ki 16:20} Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy that he made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{1Ki 16:20} 心利其余的事和他背叛的情形都写在以色列诸王记上。
{1Ki 16:21} Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts. Half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.
{1Ki 16:21} 那时，以色列民分为两半：一半随从基纳的儿子提比尼，要立他作王；一半随从暗利。
{1Ki 16:22} But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died, and Omri became king.
{1Ki 16:22} 但随从暗利的民胜过随从基纳的儿子提比尼的民。提比尼死了，暗利就作了王。
{1Ki 16:23} In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for twelve years; six years he reigned in Tirzah.
{1Ki 16:23} 犹大王亚撒三十一年，暗利登基作以色列王共十二年；在得撒作王六年。
{1Ki 16:24} He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, and he fortified the hill and called the name of the city that he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.
{1Ki 16:24} 暗利用二他连得银子向撒玛买了撒玛利亚山，在山上造城，就按着山的原主撒玛的名，给所造的城起名叫撒玛利亚。
{1Ki 16:25} Omri did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did more evil than all who were before him.
{1Ki 16:25} 暗利行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，比他以前的列王作恶更甚。
{1Ki 16:26} For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in the sins that he made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols.
{1Ki 16:26} 因他行了尼八的儿子耶罗波安所行的，犯他使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，以虚无的神惹耶和华以色列神的怒气。
{1Ki 16:27} Now the rest of the acts of Omri that he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{1Ki 16:27} 暗利其余的事和他所显出的勇力都写在以色列诸王记上。
{1Ki 16:28} And Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son reigned in his place.
{1Ki 16:28} 暗利与他列祖同睡，葬在撒玛利亚。他儿子亚哈接续他作王。
{1Ki 16:29} In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
{1Ki 16:29} 犹大王亚撒三十八年，暗利的儿子亚哈登基作了以色列王。暗利的儿子亚哈在撒玛利亚作以色列王二十二年。
{1Ki 16:30} And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him.
{1Ki 16:30} 暗利的儿子亚哈行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，比他以前的列王更甚，
{1Ki 16:31} And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took for his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal and worshiped him.
{1Ki 16:31} 犯了尼八的儿子耶罗波安所犯的罪；他还以为轻，又娶了西顿王谒巴力的女儿耶洗别为妻，去事奉敬拜巴力，
{1Ki 16:32} He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria.
{1Ki 16:32} 在撒玛利亚建造巴力的庙，在庙里为巴力筑坛。
{1Ki 16:33} And Ahab made an Asherah. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
{1Ki 16:33} 亚哈又做亚舍拉，他所行的惹耶和华以色列神的怒气，比他以前的以色列诸王更甚。
{1Ki 16:34} In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.
{1Ki 16:34} 亚哈在位的时候，有伯特利人希伊勒重修耶利哥城；立根基的时候，丧了长子亚比兰；安门的时候，丧了幼子西割，正如耶和华藉嫩的儿子约书亚所说的话。
{1Ki 17:1}  Now Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, "As the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word."
{1Ki 17:1}  基列寄居的提斯比人以利亚对亚哈说：“我指着所事奉永生耶和华以色列的神起誓，这几年我若不祷告，必不降露，不下雨。”
{1Ki 17:2}  And the word of the LORD came to him:
{1Ki 17:2}  耶和华的话临到以利亚说：
{1Ki 17:3}  "Depart from here and turn eastward and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.
{1Ki 17:3}  “你离开这里往东去，藏在约但河东边的基立溪旁。
{1Ki 17:4}  You shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there."
{1Ki 17:4}  你要喝那溪里的水，我已吩咐乌鸦在那里供养你。”
{1Ki 17:5}  So he went and did according to the word of the LORD. He went and lived by the brook Cherith that is east of the Jordan.
{1Ki 17:5}  于是以利亚照着耶和华的话，去住在约但河东的基立溪旁。
{1Ki 17:6}  And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.
{1Ki 17:6}  乌鸦早晚给他叼饼和肉来，他也喝那溪里的水。
{1Ki 17:7}  And after a while the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
{1Ki 17:7}  过了些日子，溪水就干了，因为雨没有下在地上。
{1Ki 17:8}  Then the word of the LORD came to him,
{1Ki 17:8}  耶和华的话临到他说：
{1Ki 17:9}  "Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you."
{1Ki 17:9}  “你起身往西顿的撒勒法（撒勒法与路加福音四章二十六节同）去，住在那里；我已吩咐那里的一个寡妇供养你。”
{1Ki 17:10} So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, "Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink."
{1Ki 17:10} 以利亚就起身往撒勒法去。到了城门，见有一个寡妇在那里捡柴，以利亚呼叫他说：“求你用器皿取点水来给我喝。”
{1Ki 17:11} And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, "Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand."
{1Ki 17:11} 他去取水的时候，以利亚又呼叫他说：“也求你拿点饼来给我！”
{1Ki 17:12} And she said, "As the LORD your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. And now I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it and die."
{1Ki 17:12} 他说：“我指着永生耶和华你的神起誓，我没有饼，坛内只有一把面，瓶里只有一点油；我现在找两根柴，回家要为我和我儿子做饼；我们吃了，死就死吧！”
{1Ki 17:13} And Elijah said to her, "Do not fear; go and do as you have said. But first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make something for yourself and your son.
{1Ki 17:13} 以利亚对他说：“不要惧怕！可以照你所说的去做吧！只要先为我做一个小饼拿来给我，然后为你和你的儿子做饼。
{1Ki 17:14} For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'The jar of flour shall not be spent, and the jug of oil shall not be empty, until the day that the LORD sends rain upon the earth.'"
{1Ki 17:14} 因为耶和华以色列的神如此说：坛内的面必不减少，瓶里的油必不缺短，直到耶和华使雨降在地上的日子。”
{1Ki 17:15} And she went and did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for many days.
{1Ki 17:15} 妇人就照以利亚的话去行。他和他家中的人，并以利亚，吃了许多日子。
{1Ki 17:16} The jar of flour was not spent, neither did the jug of oil become empty, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by Elijah.
{1Ki 17:16} 坛内的面果不减少，瓶里的油也不缺短，正如耶和华藉以利亚所说的话。
{1Ki 17:17} After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill. And his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.
{1Ki 17:17} 这事以后，作那家主母的妇人，他儿子病了；病得甚重，以致身无气息。
{1Ki 17:18} And she said to Elijah, "What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to cause the death of my son!"
{1Ki 17:18} 妇人对以利亚说：“神人哪，我与你何干？你竟到我这里来，使神想念我的罪，以致我的儿子死呢？”
{1Ki 17:19} And he said to her, "Give me your son." And he took him from her arms and carried him up into the upper chamber where he lodged, and laid him on his own bed.
{1Ki 17:19} 以利亚对他说：“把你儿子交给我。”以利亚就从妇人怀中将孩子接过来，抱到他所住的楼中，放在自己的床上，
{1Ki 17:20} And he cried to the LORD, "O LORD my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?"
{1Ki 17:20} 就求告耶和华说：“耶和华我的神啊，我寄居在这寡妇的家里，你就降祸与他，使他的儿子死了吗？”
{1Ki 17:21} Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the LORD, "O LORD my God, let this child's life come into him again."
{1Ki 17:21} 以利亚三次伏在孩子的身上，求告耶和华说：“耶和华我的神啊，求你使这孩子的灵魂仍入他的身体！”
{1Ki 17:22} And the LORD listened to the voice of Elijah. And the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.
{1Ki 17:22} 耶和华应允以利亚的话，孩子的灵魂仍入他的身体，他就活了。
{1Ki 17:23} And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house and delivered him to his mother. And Elijah said, "See, your son lives."
{1Ki 17:23} 以利亚将孩子从楼上抱下来，进屋子交给他母亲，说：“看哪，你的儿子活了！”
{1Ki 17:24} And the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth."
{1Ki 17:24} 妇人对以利亚说：“现在我知道你是神人，耶和华藉你口所说的话是真的。”
{1Ki 18:1}  After many days the word of the LORD came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, "Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the earth."
{1Ki 18:1}  过了许久，到第三年，耶和华的话临到以利亚说：“你去，使亚哈得见你；我要降雨在地上。”
{1Ki 18:2}  So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria.
{1Ki 18:2}  以利亚就去，要使亚哈得见他。那时，撒玛利亚有大饥荒；
{1Ki 18:3}  And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly,
{1Ki 18:3}  亚哈将他的家宰俄巴底召了来。（俄巴底甚是敬畏耶和华，
{1Ki 18:4}  and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.)
{1Ki 18:4}  耶洗别杀耶和华众先知的时候，俄巴底将一百个先知藏了，每五十人藏在一个洞里，拿饼和水供养他们。）
{1Ki 18:5}  And Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals."
{1Ki 18:5}  亚哈对俄巴底说：“我们走遍这地，到一切水泉旁和一切溪边，或者找得着青草，可以救活骡马，免得绝了牲畜。”
{1Ki 18:6}  So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.
{1Ki 18:6}  于是二人分地游行，亚哈独走一路，俄巴底独走一路。
{1Ki 18:7}  And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. And Obadiah recognized him and fell on his face and said, "Is it you, my lord Elijah?"
{1Ki 18:7}  俄巴底在路上恰与以利亚相遇，俄巴底认出他来，就俯伏在地，说：“你是我主以利亚不是？”
{1Ki 18:8}  And he answered him, "It is I. Go, tell your lord, 'Behold, Elijah is here.'"
{1Ki 18:8}  回答说：“是。你去告诉你主人说，以利亚在这里。”
{1Ki 18:9}  And he said, "How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?
{1Ki 18:9}  俄巴底说：“仆人有什么罪，你竟要将我交在亚哈手里，使他杀我呢？
{1Ki 18:10} As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they would say, 'He is not here,' he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you.
{1Ki 18:10} 我指着永生耶和华你的神起誓，无论哪一邦哪一国，我主都打发人去找你。若说你没有在那里，就必使那邦那国的人起誓说，实在是找不着你。
{1Ki 18:11} And now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, "Behold, Elijah is here."'
{1Ki 18:11} 现在你说，要去告诉你主人说，以利亚在这里；
{1Ki 18:12} And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where. And so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth.
{1Ki 18:12} 恐怕我一离开你，耶和华的灵就提你到我所不知道的地方去。这样，我去告诉亚哈，他若找不着你，就必杀我；仆人却是自幼敬畏耶和华的。
{1Ki 18:13} Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water?
{1Ki 18:13} 耶洗别杀耶和华众先知的时候，我将耶和华的一百个先知藏了，每五十人藏在一个洞里，拿饼和水供养他们，岂没有人将这事告诉我主吗？
{1Ki 18:14} And now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, "Behold, Elijah is here"'; and he will kill me."
{1Ki 18:14} 现在你说，要去告诉你主人说，以利亚在这里，他必杀我。”
{1Ki 18:15} And Elijah said, "As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today."
{1Ki 18:15} 以利亚说：“我指着所事奉永生的万军之耶和华起誓，我今日必使亚哈得见我。”
{1Ki 18:16} So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.
{1Ki 18:16} 于是俄巴底去迎着亚哈，告诉他；亚哈就去迎着以利亚。
{1Ki 18:17} When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, "Is it you, you troubler of Israel?"
{1Ki 18:17} 亚哈见了以利亚，便说：“使以色列遭灾的就是你吗？”
{1Ki 18:18} And he answered, "I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father's house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals.
{1Ki 18:18} 以利亚说：“使以色列遭灾的不是我，乃是你和你父家；因为你们离弃耶和华的诫命，去随从巴力。
{1Ki 18:19} Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."
{1Ki 18:19} 现在你当差遣人，招聚以色列众人和事奉巴力的那四百五十个先知，并耶洗别所供养事奉亚舍拉的那四百个先知，使他们都上迦密山去见我。”
{1Ki 18:20} So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
{1Ki 18:20} 亚哈就差遣人招聚以色列众人和先知都上迦密山。
{1Ki 18:21} And Elijah came near to all the people and said, "How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him." And the people did not answer him a word.
{1Ki 18:21} 以利亚前来对众民说：“你们心持两意要到几时呢？若耶和华是神，就当顺从耶和华；若巴力是神，就当顺从巴力。”众民一言不答。
{1Ki 18:22} Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal's prophets are 450 men.
{1Ki 18:22} 以利亚对众民说：“作耶和华先知的只剩下我一个人；巴力的先知却有四百五十个人。
{1Ki 18:23} Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. And I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it.
{1Ki 18:23} 当给我们两只牛犊，巴力的先知可以挑选一只，切成块子，放在柴上，不要点火；我也预备一只牛犊放在柴上，也不点火。
{1Ki 18:24} And you call upon the name of your god, and I will call upon the name of the LORD, and the God who answers by fire, he is God." And all the people answered, "It is well spoken."
{1Ki 18:24} 你们求告你们神的名，我也求告耶和华的名。那降火显应的神，就是神。”众民回答说：“这话甚好。”
{1Ki 18:25} Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many, and call upon the name of your god, but put no fire to it."
{1Ki 18:25} 以利亚对巴力的先知说：“你们既是人多，当先挑选一只牛犊，预备好了，就求告你们神的名，却不要点火。”
{1Ki 18:26} And they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, "O Baal, answer us!" But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made.
{1Ki 18:26} 他们将所得的牛犊预备好了，从早晨到午间，求告巴力的名说：“巴力啊，求你应允我们！”却没有声音，没有应允的。他们在所筑的坛四围踊跳。
{1Ki 18:27} And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, "Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened."
{1Ki 18:27} 到了正午，以利亚嬉笑他们，说：“大声求告吧！因为他是神，他或默想，或走到一边，或行路，或睡觉，你们当叫醒他。”
{1Ki 18:28} And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them.
{1Ki 18:28} 他们大声求告，按着他们的规矩，用刀枪自割、自刺，直到身体流血。
{1Ki 18:29} And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention.
{1Ki 18:29} 从午后直到献晚祭的时候，他们狂呼乱叫，却没有声音，没有应允的，也没有理会的。
{1Ki 18:30} Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come near to me." And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down.
{1Ki 18:30} 以利亚对众民说：“你们到我这里来。”众民就到他那里。他便重修已经毁坏耶和华的坛。
{1Ki 18:31} Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, "Israel shall be your name,"
{1Ki 18:31} 以利亚照雅各子孙支派的数目，取了十二块石头（耶和华的话曾临到雅各说：“你的名要叫以色列”），
{1Ki 18:32} and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed.
{1Ki 18:32} 用这些石头为耶和华的名筑一座坛，在坛的四围挖沟，可容谷种二细亚，
{1Ki 18:33} And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, "Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood."
{1Ki 18:33} 又在坛上摆好了柴，把牛犊切成块子放在柴上，对众人说：“你们用四个桶盛满水，倒在燔祭和柴上”；
{1Ki 18:34} And he said, "Do it a second time." And they did it a second time. And he said, "Do it a third time." And they did it a third time.
{1Ki 18:34} 又说：“倒第二次。”他们就倒第二次；又说：“倒第三次。”他们就倒第三次。
{1Ki 18:35} And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.
{1Ki 18:35} 水流在坛的四围，沟里也满了水。
{1Ki 18:36} And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, "O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.
{1Ki 18:36} 到了献晚祭的时候，先知以利亚近前来，说：“亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列的神，耶和华啊，求你今日使人知道你是以色列的神，也知道我是你的仆人，又是奉你的命行这一切事。
{1Ki 18:37} Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back."
{1Ki 18:37} 耶和华啊，求你应允我，应允我！使这民知道你耶和华是神，又知道是你叫这民的心回转。”
{1Ki 18:38} Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
{1Ki 18:38} 于是，耶和华降下火来，烧尽燔祭、木柴、石头、尘土，又烧干沟里的水。
{1Ki 18:39} And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, "The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God."
{1Ki 18:39} 众民看见了，就俯伏在地，说：“耶和华是神！耶和华是神！”
{1Ki 18:40} And Elijah said to them, "Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape." And they seized them. And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slaughtered them there.
{1Ki 18:40} 以利亚对他们说：“拿住巴力的先知，不容一人逃脱！”众人就拿住他们。以利亚带他们到基顺河边，在那里杀了他们。
{1Ki 18:41} And Elijah said to Ahab, "Go up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of the rushing of rain."
{1Ki 18:41} 以利亚对亚哈说：“你现在可以上去吃喝，因为有多雨的响声了。”
{1Ki 18:42} So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel. And he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees.
{1Ki 18:42} 亚哈就上去吃喝。以利亚上了迦密山顶，屈身在地，将脸伏在两膝之中；
{1Ki 18:43} And he said to his servant, "Go up now, look toward the sea." And he went up and looked and said, "There is nothing." And he said, "Go again," seven times.
{1Ki 18:43} 对仆人说：“你上去，向海观看。”仆人就上去观看，说：“没有什么。”他说：“你再去观看。”如此七次。
{1Ki 18:44} And at the seventh time he said, "Behold, a little cloud like a man's hand is rising from the sea." And he said, "Go up, say to Ahab, 'Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.'"
{1Ki 18:44} 第七次仆人说：“我看见有一小片云从海里上来，不过如人手那样大。”以利亚说：“你上去告诉亚哈，当套车下去，免得被雨阻挡。”
{1Ki 18:45} And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.
{1Ki 18:45} 霎时间，天因风云黑暗，降下大雨。亚哈就坐车往耶斯列去了。
{1Ki 18:46} And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah, and he gathered up his garment and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
{1Ki 18:46} 耶和华的灵（原文作手）降在以利亚身上，他就束上腰，奔在亚哈前头，直到耶斯列的城门。
{1Ki 19:1}  Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
{1Ki 19:1}  亚哈将以利亚一切所行的和他用刀杀众先知的事都告诉耶洗别。
{1Ki 19:2}  Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow."
{1Ki 19:2}  耶洗别就差遣人去见以利亚，告诉他说：“明日约在这时候，我若不使你的性命像那些人的性命一样，愿神明重重的降罚与我。”
{1Ki 19:3}  Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
{1Ki 19:3}  以利亚见这光景就起来逃命，到了犹大的别是巴，将仆人留在那里，
{1Ki 19:4}  But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that he might die, saying, "It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers."
{1Ki 19:4}  自己在旷野走了一日的路程，来到一棵罗腾树下（罗腾，小树名，松类；下同），就坐在那里求死，说：“耶和华啊，罢了！求你取我的性命，因为我不胜于我的列祖。”
{1Ki 19:5}  And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, "Arise and eat."
{1Ki 19:5}  他就躺在罗腾树下，睡着了。有一个天使拍他，说：“起来吃吧！”
{1Ki 19:6}  And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again.
{1Ki 19:6}  他观看，见头旁有一瓶水与炭火烧的饼，他就吃了喝了，仍然躺下。
{1Ki 19:7}  And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, "Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you."
{1Ki 19:7}  耶和华的使者第二次来拍他，说：“起来吃吧！因为你当走的路甚远。”
{1Ki 19:8}  And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.
{1Ki 19:8}  他就起来吃了喝了，仗着这饮食的力，走了四十昼夜，到了神的山，就是何烈山。
{1Ki 19:9}  There he came to a cave and lodged in it. And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
{1Ki 19:9}  他在那里进了一个洞，就住在洞中。耶和华的话临到他说：“以利亚啊，你在这里做什么？”
{1Ki 19:10} He said, "I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away."
{1Ki 19:10} 他说：“我为耶和华万军之神大发热心；因为以色列人背弃了你的约，毁坏了你的坛，用刀杀了你的先知，只剩下我一个人，他们还要寻索我的命。”
{1Ki 19:11} And he said, "Go out and stand on the mount before the LORD." And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
{1Ki 19:11} 耶和华说：“你出来站在山上，在我面前。”那时耶和华从那里经过，在他面前有烈风大作，崩山碎石，耶和华却不在风中；风后地震，耶和华却不在其中；
{1Ki 19:12} And after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper.
{1Ki 19:12} 地震后有火，耶和华也不在火中；火后有微小的声音。
{1Ki 19:13} And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him and said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
{1Ki 19:13} 以利亚听见，就用外衣蒙上脸，出来站在洞口。有声音向他说：“以利亚啊，你在这里做什么？”
{1Ki 19:14} He said, "I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away."
{1Ki 19:14} 他说：“我为耶和华万军之神大发热心；因为以色列人背弃了你的约，毁坏了你的坛，用刀杀了你的先知，只剩下我一个人，他们还要寻索我的命。”
{1Ki 19:15} And the LORD said to him, "Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.
{1Ki 19:15} 耶和华对他说：“你回去，从旷野往大马色去。到了那里，就要膏哈薛作亚兰王，
{1Ki 19:16} And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.
{1Ki 19:16} 又膏宁示的孙子耶户作以色列王，并膏亚伯米何拉人沙法的儿子以利沙作先知接续你。
{1Ki 19:17} And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death.
{1Ki 19:17} 将来躲避哈薛之刀的，必被耶户所杀；躲避耶户之刀的，必被以利沙所杀。
{1Ki 19:18} Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him."
{1Ki 19:18} 但我在以色列人中为自己留下七千人，是未曾向巴力屈膝的，未曾与巴力亲嘴的。”
{1Ki 19:19} So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen in front of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and cast his cloak upon him.
{1Ki 19:19} 于是，以利亚离开那里走了，遇见沙法的儿子以利沙耕地；在他前头有十二对牛，自己赶着第十二对。以利亚到他那里去，将自己的外衣搭在他身上。
{1Ki 19:20} And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, "Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you." And he said to him, "Go back again, for what have I done to you?"
{1Ki 19:20} 以利沙就离开牛，跑到以利亚那里，说：“求你容我先与父母亲嘴，然后我便跟随你。”以利亚对他说：“你回去吧，我向你做了什么呢？”
{1Ki 19:21} And he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and assisted him.
{1Ki 19:21} 以利沙就离开他回去，宰了一对牛，用套牛的器具煮肉给民吃，随后就起身跟随以利亚，服事他。
{1Ki 20:1}  Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together. Thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and closed in on Samaria and fought against it.
{1Ki 20:1}  亚兰王便哈达聚集他的全军，率领三十二个王，带着车马上来围攻撒玛利亚；
{1Ki 20:2}  And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, "Thus says Ben-hadad:
{1Ki 20:2}  又差遣使者进城见以色列王亚哈，对他说：“便哈达如此说：
{1Ki 20:3}  'Your silver and your gold are mine; your best wives and children also are mine.'"
{1Ki 20:3}  你的金银都要归我，你妻子儿女中最美的也要归我。”
{1Ki 20:4}  And the king of Israel answered, "As you say, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have."
{1Ki 20:4}  以色列王回答说：“我主我王啊，可以依着你的话，我与我所有的都归你。”
{1Ki 20:5}  The messengers came again and said, "Thus says Ben-hadad: 'I sent to you, saying, "Deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children."
{1Ki 20:5}  使者又来说：“便哈达如此说：我已差遣人去见你，要你将你的金银、妻子、儿女都给我。
{1Ki 20:6}  Nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants and lay hands on whatever pleases you and take it away.'"
{1Ki 20:6}  但明日约在这时候，我还要差遣臣仆到你那里，搜查你的家和你仆人的家，将你眼中一切所喜爱的都拿了去。”
{1Ki 20:7}  Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, "Mark, now, and see how this man is seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my wives and my children, and for my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him."
{1Ki 20:7}  以色列王召了国中的长老来，对他们说：“请你们看看，这人是怎样地谋害我，他先差遣人到我这里来，要我的妻子、儿女，和金银，我并没有推辞他。”
{1Ki 20:8}  And all the elders and all the people said to him, "Do not listen or consent."
{1Ki 20:8}  长老和百姓对王说：“不要听从他，也不要应允他。”
{1Ki 20:9}  So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, "Tell my lord the king, 'All that you first demanded of your servant I will do, but this thing I cannot do.'" And the messengers departed and brought him word again.
{1Ki 20:9}  故此，以色列王对便哈达的使者说：“你们告诉我主我王说：王头一次差遣人向仆人所要的，仆人都依从；但这次所要的，我不能依从。”使者就去回覆便哈达。
{1Ki 20:10} Ben-hadad sent to him and said, "The gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me."
{1Ki 20:10} 便哈达又差遣人去见亚哈说：“撒玛利亚的尘土若够跟从我的人每人捧一捧的，愿神明重重的降罚与我！”
{1Ki 20:11} And the king of Israel answered, "Tell him, 'Let not him who straps on his armor boast himself as he who takes it off.'"
{1Ki 20:11} 以色列王说：“你告诉他说，才顶盔贯甲的，休要像摘盔卸甲的夸口。”
{1Ki 20:12} When Ben-hadad heard this message as he was drinking with the kings in the booths, he said to his men, "Take your positions." And they took their positions against the city.
{1Ki 20:12} 便哈达和诸王正在帐幕里喝酒，听见这话，就对他臣仆说：“摆队吧！”他们就摆队攻城。
{1Ki 20:13} And behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said, "Thus says the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will give it into your hand this day, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
{1Ki 20:13} 有一个先知来见以色列王亚哈，说：“耶和华如此说：‘这一大群人你看见了吗？今日我必将他们交在你手里，你就知道我是耶和华。’”
{1Ki 20:14} And Ahab said, "By whom?" He said, "Thus says the LORD, By the servants of the governors of the districts." Then he said, "Who shall begin the battle?" He answered, "You."
{1Ki 20:14} 亚哈说：“藉着谁呢？”他回答说：“耶和华说，藉着跟从省长的少年人。”亚哈说：“要谁率领呢？”他说：“要你亲自率领。”
{1Ki 20:15} Then he mustered the servants of the governors of the districts, and they were 232. And after them he mustered all the people of Israel, seven thousand.
{1Ki 20:15} 于是亚哈数点跟从省长的少年人，共有二百三十二名，后又数点以色列的众兵，共有七千名。
{1Ki 20:16} And they went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the thirty-two kings who helped him.
{1Ki 20:16} 午间，他们就出城；便哈达和帮助他的三十二个王正在帐幕里痛饮。
{1Ki 20:17} The servants of the governors of the districts went out first. And Ben-hadad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, "Men are coming out from Samaria."
{1Ki 20:17} 跟从省长的少年人先出城；便哈达差遣人去探望，他们回报说：“有人从撒玛利亚出来了。”
{1Ki 20:18} He said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive. Or if they have come out for war, take them alive."
{1Ki 20:18} 他说：“他们若为讲和出来，要活捉他们；若为打仗出来，也要活捉他们。”
{1Ki 20:19} So these went out of the city, the servants of the governors of the districts and the army that followed them.
{1Ki 20:19} 跟从省长的少年人出城，军兵跟随他们；
{1Ki 20:20} And each struck down his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them, but Ben-hadad king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.
{1Ki 20:20} 各人遇见敌人就杀。亚兰人逃跑，以色列人追赶他们；亚兰王便哈达骑着马和马兵一同逃跑。
{1Ki 20:21} And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and struck the Syrians with a great blow.
{1Ki 20:21} 以色列王出城攻打车马，大大击杀亚兰人。
{1Ki 20:22} Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, "Come, strengthen yourself, and consider well what you have to do, for in the spring the king of Syria will come up against you."
{1Ki 20:22} 那先知来见以色列王，对他说：“你当自强，留心怎样防备；因为到明年这时候，亚兰王必上来攻击你。”
{1Ki 20:23} And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, "Their gods are gods of the hills, and so they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
{1Ki 20:23} 亚兰王的臣仆对亚兰王说：“以色列人的神是山神，所以他们胜过我们；但在平原与他们打仗，我们必定得胜。
{1Ki 20:24} And do this: remove the kings, each from his post, and put commanders in their places,
{1Ki 20:24} 王当这样行：把诸王革去，派军长代替他们，
{1Ki 20:25} and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they." And he listened to their voice and did so.
{1Ki 20:25} 又照着王丧失军兵之数，再招募一军，马补马，车补车，我们在平原与他们打仗，必定得胜。”王便听臣仆的话去行。
{1Ki 20:26} In the spring, Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
{1Ki 20:26} 次年，便哈达果然点齐亚兰人上亚弗去，要与以色列人打仗。
{1Ki 20:27} And the people of Israel were mustered and were provisioned and went against them. The people of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the country.
{1Ki 20:27} 以色列人也点齐军兵，预备食物，迎着亚兰人出去，对着他们安营，好像两小群山羊羔；亚兰人却满了地面。
{1Ki 20:28} And a man of God came near and said to the king of Israel, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because the Syrians have said, "The LORD is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys," therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.'"
{1Ki 20:28} 有神人来见以色列王，说：“耶和华如此说：‘亚兰人既说我耶和华是山神，不是平原的神，所以我必将这一大群人都交在你手中，你们就知道我是耶和华。’”
{1Ki 20:29} And they encamped opposite one another seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle was joined. And the people of Israel struck down of the Syrians 100,000 foot soldiers in one day.
{1Ki 20:29} 以色列人与亚兰人相对安营七日，到第七日两军交战；那一日以色列人杀了亚兰人步兵十万，
{1Ki 20:30} And the rest fled into the city of Aphek, and the wall fell upon 27,000 men who were left. Ben-hadad also fled and entered an inner chamber in the city.
{1Ki 20:30} 其余的逃入亚弗城；城墙塌倒，压死剩下的二万七千人。便哈达也逃入城，藏在严密的屋子里。
{1Ki 20:31} And his servants said to him, "Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life."
{1Ki 20:31} 他的臣仆对他说：“我们听说以色列王都是仁慈的王，现在我们不如腰束麻布，头套绳索，出去投降以色列王，或者他存留王的性命。”
{1Ki 20:32} So they tied sackcloth around their waists and put ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel and said, "Your servant Ben-hadad says, 'Please, let me live.'" And he said, "Does he still live? He is my brother."
{1Ki 20:32} 于是他们腰束麻布，头套绳索，去见以色列王，说：“王的仆人便哈达说，求王存留我的性命。”亚哈说：“他还活着吗？他是我的兄弟。”
{1Ki 20:33} Now the men were watching for a sign, and they quickly took it up from him and said, "Yes, your brother Ben-hadad." Then he said, "Go and bring him." Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
{1Ki 20:33} 这些人留心探出他的口气来，便急忙就着他的话说：“便哈达是王的兄弟！”王说：“你们去请他来。”便哈达出来见王，王就请他上车。
{1Ki 20:34} And Ben-hadad said to him, "The cities that my father took from your father I will restore, and you may establish bazaars for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria." And Ahab said, "I will let you go on these terms." So he made a covenant with him and let him go.
{1Ki 20:34} 便哈达对王说：“我父从你父那里所夺的城邑，我必归还。你可以在大马色立街市，像我父在撒玛利亚所立的一样。”亚哈说：“我照此立约，放你回去”，就与他立约，放他去了。
{1Ki 20:35} And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow at the command of the LORD, "Strike me, please." But the man refused to strike him.
{1Ki 20:35} 有先知的一个门徒奉耶和华的命对他的同伴说：“你打我吧！”那人不肯打他。
{1Ki 20:36} Then he said to him, "Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you have gone from me, a lion shall strike you down." And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion met him and struck him down.
{1Ki 20:36} 他就对那人说：“你既不听从耶和华的话，你一离开我，必有狮子咬死你。”那人一离开他，果然遇见狮子，把他咬死了。
{1Ki 20:37} Then he found another man and said, "Strike me, please." And the man struck him--struck him and wounded him.
{1Ki 20:37} 先知的门徒又遇见一个人，对他说：“你打我吧！”那人就打他，将他打伤。
{1Ki 20:38} So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.
{1Ki 20:38} 他就去了，用头巾蒙眼，改换面目，在路旁等候王。
{1Ki 20:39} And as the king passed, he cried to the king and said, "Your servant went out into the midst of the battle, and behold, a soldier turned and brought a man to me and said, 'Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.'
{1Ki 20:39} 王从那里经过，他向王呼叫说：“仆人在阵上的时候，有人带了一个人来，对我说：‘你看守这人，若把他失了，你的性命必代替他的性命；不然，你必交出一他连得银子来。’
{1Ki 20:40} And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone." The king of Israel said to him, "So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it."
{1Ki 20:40} 仆人正在忙乱之间，那人就不见了。”以色列王对他说：“你自己定妥了，必照样判断你。”
{1Ki 20:41} Then he hurried to take the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
{1Ki 20:41} 他急忙除掉蒙眼的头巾，以色列王就认出他是一个先知。
{1Ki 20:42} And he said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people.'"
{1Ki 20:42} 他对王说：“耶和华如此说：‘因你将我定要灭绝的人放去，你的命就必代替他的命，你的民也必代替他的民。’”
{1Ki 20:43} And the king of Israel went to his house vexed and sullen and came to Samaria.
{1Ki 20:43} 于是以色列王闷闷不乐地回到撒玛利亚，进了他的宫。
{1Ki 21:1}  Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
{1Ki 21:1}  这事以后，又有一事。耶斯列人拿伯在耶斯列有一个葡萄园，靠近撒玛利亚王亚哈的宫。
{1Ki 21:2}  And after this Ahab said to Naboth, "Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house, and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money."
{1Ki 21:2}  亚哈对拿伯说：“你将你的葡萄园给我作菜园，因为是靠近我的宫；我就把更好的葡萄园换给你，或是你要银子，我就按着价值给你。”
{1Ki 21:3}  But Naboth said to Ahab, "The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers."
{1Ki 21:3}  拿伯对亚哈说：“我敬畏耶和华，万不敢将我先人留下的产业给你。”
{1Ki 21:4}  And Ahab went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him, for he had said, "I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers." And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no food.
{1Ki 21:4}  亚哈因耶斯列人拿伯说“我不敢将我先人留下的产业给你”，就闷闷不乐地回宫，躺在床上，转脸向内，也不吃饭。
{1Ki 21:5}  But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, "Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food?"
{1Ki 21:5}  王后耶洗别来问他说：“你为什么心里这样忧闷，不吃饭呢？”
{1Ki 21:6}  And he said to her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, 'Give me your vineyard for money, or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it.' And he answered, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"
{1Ki 21:6}  他回答说：“因我向耶斯列人拿伯说：‘你将你的葡萄园给我，我给你价银，或是你愿意，我就把别的葡萄园换给你’；他却说：‘我不将我的葡萄园给你。’”
{1Ki 21:7}  And Jezebel his wife said to him, "Do you now govern Israel? Arise and eat bread and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
{1Ki 21:7}  王后耶洗别对亚哈说：“你现在是治理以色列国不是？只管起来，心里畅畅快快地吃饭，我必将耶斯列人拿伯的葡萄园给你。”
{1Ki 21:8}  So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal, and she sent the letters to the elders and the leaders who lived with Naboth in his city.
{1Ki 21:8}  于是托亚哈的名写信，用王的印印上，送给那些与拿伯同城居住的长老贵胄。
{1Ki 21:9}  And she wrote in the letters, "Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people.
{1Ki 21:9}  信上写着说：“你们当宣告禁食，叫拿伯坐在民间的高位上，
{1Ki 21:10} And set two worthless men opposite him, and let them bring a charge against him, saying, 'You have cursed God and the king.' Then take him out and stone him to death."
{1Ki 21:10} 又叫两个匪徒坐在拿伯对面，作见证告他说：‘你谤渎神和王了’；随后就把他拉出去用石头打死。”
{1Ki 21:11} And the men of his city, the elders and the leaders who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. As it was written in the letters that she had sent to them,
{1Ki 21:11} 那些与拿伯同城居住的长老贵胄得了耶洗别的信，就照信而行，
{1Ki 21:12} they proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people.
{1Ki 21:12} 宣告禁食，叫拿伯坐在民间的高位上。
{1Ki 21:13} And the two worthless men came in and sat opposite him. And the worthless men brought a charge against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones.
{1Ki 21:13} 有两个匪徒来，坐在拿伯的对面，当着众民作见证告他说：“拿伯谤渎神和王了！”众人就把他拉到城外，用石头打死。
{1Ki 21:14} Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned; he is dead."
{1Ki 21:14} 于是打发人去见耶洗别，说：“拿伯被石头打死了。”
{1Ki 21:15} As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, "Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead."
{1Ki 21:15} 耶洗别听见拿伯被石头打死，就对亚哈说：“你起来得耶斯列人拿伯不肯为价银给你的葡萄园吧！现在他已经死了。”
{1Ki 21:16} And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
{1Ki 21:16} 亚哈听见拿伯死了，就起来，下去要得耶斯列人拿伯的葡萄园。
{1Ki 21:17} Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
{1Ki 21:17} 耶和华的话临到提斯比人以利亚说：
{1Ki 21:18} "Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession.
{1Ki 21:18} “你起来，去见住撒玛利亚的以色列王亚哈，他下去要得拿伯的葡萄园，现今正在那园里。
{1Ki 21:19} And you shall say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Have you killed and also taken possession?"' And you shall say to him, 'Thus says the LORD: "In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood."'"
{1Ki 21:19} 你要对他说：‘耶和华如此说：你杀了人，又得他的产业吗？’又要对他说：‘耶和华如此说：狗在何处舔拿伯的血，也必在何处舔你的血。’”
{1Ki 21:20} Ahab said to Elijah, "Have you found me, O my enemy?" He answered, "I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD.
{1Ki 21:20} 亚哈对以利亚说：“我仇敌啊，你找到我吗？”他回答说：“我找到你了；因为你卖了自己，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。
{1Ki 21:21} Behold, I will bring disaster upon you. I will utterly burn you up, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.
{1Ki 21:21} 耶和华说：‘我必使灾祸临到你，将你除尽。凡属你的男丁，无论困住的、自由的，都从以色列中剪除。
{1Ki 21:22} And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin.
{1Ki 21:22} 我必使你的家像尼八的儿子耶罗波安的家，又像亚希雅的儿子巴沙的家；因为你惹我发怒，又使以色列人陷在罪里。’
{1Ki 21:23} And of Jezebel the LORD also said, 'The dogs shall eat Jezebel within the walls of Jezreel.'
{1Ki 21:23} 论到耶洗别，耶和华也说：‘狗在耶斯列的外郭必吃耶洗别的肉。
{1Ki 21:24} Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone of his who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat."
{1Ki 21:24} 凡属亚哈的人，死在城中的必被狗吃，死在田野的必被空中的鸟吃。’”
{1Ki 21:25} (There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the LORD like Ahab, whom Jezebel his wife incited.
{1Ki 21:25} （从来没有像亚哈的，因他自卖，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，受了王后耶洗别的耸动；
{1Ki 21:26} He acted very abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the LORD cast out before the people of Israel.)
{1Ki 21:26} 就照耶和华在以色列人面前所赶出的亚摩利人，行了最可憎恶的事，信从偶像。）
{1Ki 21:27} And when Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went about dejectedly.
{1Ki 21:27} 亚哈听见这话，就撕裂衣服，禁食，身穿麻布，睡卧也穿着麻布，并且缓缓而行。
{1Ki 21:28} And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
{1Ki 21:28} 耶和华的话临到提斯比人以利亚说：
{1Ki 21:29} "Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; but in his son's days I will bring the disaster upon his house."
{1Ki 21:29} “亚哈在我面前这样自卑，你看见了吗？因他在我面前自卑，他还在世的时候，我不降这祸；到他儿子的时候，我必降这祸与他的家。”
{1Ki 22:1}  For three years Syria and Israel continued without war.
{1Ki 22:1}  亚兰国和以色列国三年没有争战。
{1Ki 22:2}  But in the third year Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
{1Ki 22:2}  到第三年，犹大王约沙法下去见以色列王。
{1Ki 22:3}  And the king of Israel said to his servants, "Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
{1Ki 22:3}  以色列王对臣仆说：“你们不知道基列的拉末是属我们的吗？我们岂可静坐不动，不从亚兰王手里夺回来吗？”
{1Ki 22:4}  And he said to Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?" And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
{1Ki 22:4}  亚哈问约沙法说：“你肯同我去攻取基列的拉末吗？”约沙法对以色列王说：“你我不分彼此，我的民与你的民一样，我的马与你的马一样。”
{1Ki 22:5}  And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Inquire first for the word of the LORD."
{1Ki 22:5}  约沙法对以色列王说：“请你先求问耶和华。”
{1Ki 22:6}  Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?" And they said, "Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king."
{1Ki 22:6}  于是以色列王招聚先知，约有四百人，问他们说：“我上去攻取基列的拉末可以不可以？”他们说：“可以上去，因为主必将那城交在王的手里。”
{1Ki 22:7}  But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?"
{1Ki 22:7}  约沙法说：“这里不是还有耶和华的先知，我们可以求问他吗？”
{1Ki 22:8}  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil." And Jehoshaphat said, "Let not the king say so."
{1Ki 22:8}  以色列王对约沙法说：“还有一个人，是音拉的儿子米该雅，我们可以托他求问耶和华。只是我恨他；因为他指着我所说的预言，不说吉语，单说凶言。”约沙法说：“王不必这样说。”
{1Ki 22:9}  Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah."
{1Ki 22:9}  以色列王就召了一个太监来，说：“你快去，将音拉的儿子米该雅召来。”
{1Ki 22:10} Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
{1Ki 22:10} 以色列王和犹大王约沙法在撒玛利亚城门前的空场上，各穿朝服，坐在位上，所有的先知都在他们面前说预言。
{1Ki 22:11} And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.'"
{1Ki 22:11} 基拿拿的儿子西底家造了两个铁角，说：“耶和华如此说：‘你要用这角抵触亚兰人，直到将他们灭尽。’”
{1Ki 22:12} And all the prophets prophesied so and said, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."
{1Ki 22:12} 所有的先知也都这样预言说：“可以上基列的拉末去，必然得胜，因为耶和华必将那城交在王的手中。”
{1Ki 22:13} And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, "Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably."
{1Ki 22:13} 那去召米该雅的使者对米该雅说；“众先知一口同音地都向王说吉言，你不如与他们说一样的话，也说吉言。”
{1Ki 22:14} But Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, what the LORD says to me, that I will speak."
{1Ki 22:14} 米该雅说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，耶和华对我说什么，我就说什么。”
{1Ki 22:15} And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?" And he answered him, "Go up and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."
{1Ki 22:15} 米该雅到王面前，王问他说：“米该雅啊，我们上去攻取基列的拉末可以不可以？”他回答说：“可以上去，必然得胜，耶和华必将那城交在王的手中。”
{1Ki 22:16} But the king said to him, "How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
{1Ki 22:16} 王对他说：“我当嘱咐你几次，你才奉耶和华的名向我说实话呢？”
{1Ki 22:17} And he said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, 'These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.'"
{1Ki 22:17} 米该雅说：“我看见以色列众民散在山上，如同没有牧人的羊群一般。耶和华说：‘这民没有主人，他们可以平平安安的各归各家去。’”
{1Ki 22:18} And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"
{1Ki 22:18} 以色列王对约沙法说：“我岂没有告诉你，这人指着我所说的预言，不说吉语单说凶言吗？”
{1Ki 22:19} And Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left;
{1Ki 22:19} 米该雅说：“你要听耶和华的话！我看见耶和华坐在宝座上，天上的万军侍立在他左右。
{1Ki 22:20} and the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said one thing, and another said another.
{1Ki 22:20} 耶和华说：‘谁去引诱亚哈上基列的拉末去阵亡呢？’这个就这样说，那个就那样说。
{1Ki 22:21} Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, 'I will entice him.'
{1Ki 22:21} 随后有一个神灵出来，站在耶和华面前，说：‘我去引诱他。’
{1Ki 22:22} And the LORD said to him, 'By what means?' And he said, 'I will go out, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And he said, 'You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so.'
{1Ki 22:22} 耶和华问他说：‘你用何法呢？’他说：‘我去，要在他众先知口中作谎言的灵。’耶和华说：‘这样，你必能引诱他，你去如此行吧！’
{1Ki 22:23} Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the LORD has declared disaster for you."
{1Ki 22:23} 现在耶和华使谎言的灵入了你这些先知的口，并且耶和华已经命定降祸与你。”
{1Ki 22:24} Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, "How did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?"
{1Ki 22:24} 基拿拿的儿子西底家前来，打米该雅的脸，说：“耶和华的灵从那里离开我与你说话呢？”
{1Ki 22:25} And Micaiah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself."
{1Ki 22:25} 米该雅说：“你进严密的屋子藏躲的那日，就必看见了。”
{1Ki 22:26} And the king of Israel said, "Seize Micaiah, and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son,
{1Ki 22:26} 以色列王说：“将米该雅带回，交给邑宰亚们和王的儿子约阿施，说
{1Ki 22:27} and say, 'Thus says the king, "Put this fellow in prison and feed him meager rations of bread and water, until I come in peace."'"
{1Ki 22:27} 王如此说，把这个人下在监里，使他受苦，吃不饱喝不足，等候我平平安安的回来。”
{1Ki 22:28} And Micaiah said, "If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Hear, all you peoples!"
{1Ki 22:28} 米该雅说：“你若能平平安安的回来，那就是耶和华没有藉我说这话了”；又说：“众民哪，你们都要听！”
{1Ki 22:29} So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
{1Ki 22:29} 以色列王和犹大王约沙法上基列的拉末去了。
{1Ki 22:30} And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes." And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
{1Ki 22:30} 以色列王对约沙法说：“我要改装上阵，你可以仍穿王服。”以色列王就改装上阵。
{1Ki 22:31} Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, "Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel."
{1Ki 22:31} 先是亚兰王吩咐他的三十二个车兵长说：“他们的兵将，无论大小，你们都不可与他们争战，只要与以色列王争战。”
{1Ki 22:32} And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "It is surely the king of Israel." So they turned to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out.
{1Ki 22:32} 车兵长看见约沙法，便说：“这必是以色列王！”就转过去与他争战，约沙法便呼喊。
{1Ki 22:33} And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
{1Ki 22:33} 车兵长见不是以色列王，就转去不追他了。
{1Ki 22:34} But a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn around and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded."
{1Ki 22:34} 有一人随便开弓，恰巧射入以色列王的甲缝里。王对赶车的说：“我受了重伤，你转过车来，拉我出阵吧！”
{1Ki 22:35} And the battle continued that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died. And the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.
{1Ki 22:35} 那日，阵势越战越猛，有人扶王站在车上，抵挡亚兰人。到晚上，王就死了，血从伤处流在车中。
{1Ki 22:36} And about sunset a cry went through the army, "Every man to his city, and every man to his country!"
{1Ki 22:36} 约在日落的时候，有号令传遍军中，说：“各归本城，各归本地吧！”
{1Ki 22:37} So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria.
{1Ki 22:37} 王既死了，众人将他送到撒玛利亚，就葬在那里；
{1Ki 22:38} And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the prostitutes washed themselves in it, according to the word of the LORD that he had spoken.
{1Ki 22:38} 又有人把他的车洗在撒玛利亚的池旁（妓女在那里洗澡），狗来舔他的血，正如耶和华所说的话。
{1Ki 22:39} Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, and the ivory house that he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{1Ki 22:39} 亚哈其余的事，凡他所行的和他所修造的象牙宫，并所建筑的一切城邑，都写在以色列诸王记上。
{1Ki 22:40} So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.
{1Ki 22:40} 亚哈与他列祖同睡。他儿子亚哈谢接续他作王。
{1Ki 22:41} Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
{1Ki 22:41} 以色列王亚哈第四年，亚撒的儿子约沙法登基作了犹大王。
{1Ki 22:42} Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
{1Ki 22:42} 约沙法登基的时候年三十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十五年。他母亲名叫阿苏巴，乃示利希的女儿。
{1Ki 22:43} He walked in all the way of Asa his father. He did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD. Yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places.
{1Ki 22:43} 约沙法行他父亲亚撒所行的道，不偏离左右，行耶和华眼中看为正的事；只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓仍在那里献祭烧香。
{1Ki 22:44} Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
{1Ki 22:44} 约沙法与以色列王和好。
{1Ki 22:45} Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{1Ki 22:45} 约沙法其余的事和他所显出的勇力，并他怎样争战，都写在犹大列王记上。
{1Ki 22:46} And from the land he exterminated the remnant of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the days of his father Asa.
{1Ki 22:46} 约沙法将他父亲亚撒在世所剩下的娈童都从国中除去了。
