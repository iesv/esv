{1Sa 1:1}   There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah /elkxna/ the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.
{1Sa 1:1}   以法莲山地的拉玛琐非有一个以法莲人，名叫以利加拿，是苏弗的玄孙，托户的曾孙，以利户的孙子，耶罗罕的儿子。
{1Sa 1:2}   He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, /hxna/ and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
{1Sa 1:2}   他有两个妻：一名哈拿，一名毗尼拿。毗尼拿有儿女，哈拿没有儿女。
{1Sa 1:3}   Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD.
{1Sa 1:3}   这人每年从本城上到示罗，敬拜祭祀万军之耶和华；在那里有以利的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈当耶和华的祭司。
{1Sa 1:4}   On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions /porSCn/ to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters.
{1Sa 1:4}   以利加拿每逢献祭的日子，将祭肉分给他的妻毗尼拿和毗尼拿所生的儿女；
{1Sa 1:5}   But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb.
{1Sa 1:5}   给哈拿的却是双分，因为他爱哈拿。无奈耶和华不使哈拿生育。
{1Sa 1:6}   And her rival used to provoke /prC'vOk/ her grievously /grEvCsly/ to irritate /iritAt/ her, because the LORD had closed her womb.
{1Sa 1:6}   毗尼拿见耶和华不使哈拿生育，就作他的对头，大大激动他，要使他生气。
{1Sa 1:7}   So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.
{1Sa 1:7}   每年上到耶和华殿的时候，以利加拿都以双分给哈拿；毗尼拿仍是激动他，以致他哭泣不吃饭。
{1Sa 1:8}   And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?"
{1Sa 1:8}   他丈夫以利加拿对他说：“哈拿啊，你为何哭泣，不吃饭，心里愁闷呢？有我不比十个儿子还好吗？”
{1Sa 1:9}   After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.
{1Sa 1:9}   他们在示罗吃喝完了，哈拿就站起来。祭司以利在耶和华殿的门框旁边，坐在自己的位上。
{1Sa 1:10}  She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly.
{1Sa 1:10}  哈拿心里愁苦，就痛痛哭泣，祈祷耶和华，
{1Sa 1:11}  And she vowed a vow and said, "O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head."
{1Sa 1:11}  许愿说：“万军之耶和华啊，你若垂顾婢女的苦情，眷念不忘婢女，赐我一个儿子，我必使他终身归与耶和华，不用剃头刀剃他的头。”
{1Sa 1:12}  As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.
{1Sa 1:12}  哈拿在耶和华面前不住地祈祷，以利定睛看他的嘴。
{1Sa 1:13}  Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman.
{1Sa 1:13}  （原来哈拿心中默祷，只动嘴唇，不出声音，因此以利以为他喝醉了。）
{1Sa 1:14}  And Eli said to her, "How long will you go on being drunk? Put your wine away from you."
{1Sa 1:14}  以利对他说：“你要醉到几时呢？你不应该喝酒。”
{1Sa 1:15}  But Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.
{1Sa 1:15}  哈拿回答说：“主啊，不是这样。我是心里愁苦的妇人，清酒浓酒都没有喝，但在耶和华面前倾心吐意。
{1Sa 1:16}  Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation."
{1Sa 1:16}  不要将婢女看作不正经的女子。我因被人激动，愁苦太多，所以祈求到如今。”
{1Sa 1:17}  Then Eli answered, "Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him."
{1Sa 1:17}  以利说：“你可以平平安安的回去。愿以色列的神允准你向他所求的！”
{1Sa 1:18}  And she said, "Let your servant find favor in your eyes." Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.
{1Sa 1:18}  哈拿说：“愿婢女在你眼前蒙恩。”于是妇人走去吃饭，面上再不带愁容了。
{1Sa 1:19}  They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.
{1Sa 1:19}  次日清早，他们起来，在耶和华面前敬拜，就回拉玛。到了家里，以利加拿和妻哈拿同房，耶和华顾念哈拿，
{1Sa 1:20}  And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, "I have asked for him from the LORD."
{1Sa 1:20}  哈拿就怀孕。日期满足，生了一个儿子，给他起名叫撒母耳，说：“这是我从耶和华那里求来的。”
{1Sa 1:21}  The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow.
{1Sa 1:21}  以利加拿和他全家都上示罗去，要向耶和华献年祭，并还所许的愿。
{1Sa 1:22}  But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the LORD and dwell there forever."
{1Sa 1:22}  哈拿却没有上去，对丈夫说：“等孩子断了奶，我便带他上去朝见耶和华，使他永远住在那里。”
{1Sa 1:23}  Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the LORD establish his word." So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.
{1Sa 1:23}  他丈夫以利加拿说：“就随你的意行吧！可以等儿子断了奶。但愿耶和华应验他的话。”于是妇人在家里乳养儿子，直到断了奶；
{1Sa 1:24}  And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. And the child was young.
{1Sa 1:24}  既断了奶，就把孩子带上示罗，到了耶和华的殿；又带了三只公牛，一伊法细面，一皮袋酒。（那时，孩子还小。）
{1Sa 1:25}  Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.
{1Sa 1:25}  宰了一只公牛，就领孩子到以利面前。
{1Sa 1:26}  And she said, "Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD.
{1Sa 1:26}  妇人说：“主啊，我敢在你面前起誓，从前在你这里站着祈求耶和华的那妇人，就是我。
{1Sa 1:27}  For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him.
{1Sa 1:27}  我祈求为要得这孩子；耶和华已将我所求的赐给我了。
{1Sa 1:28}  Therefore I have lent him to the LORD. As long as he lives, he is lent to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there.
{1Sa 1:28}  所以，我将这孩子归与耶和华，使他终身归与耶和华。”于是在那里敬拜耶和华。
{1Sa 2:1}   And Hannah prayed and said, "My heart exults in the LORD; my horn is exalted in the LORD. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation.
{1Sa 2:1}   哈拿祷告说：我的心因耶和华快乐；我的角因耶和华高举。我的口向仇敌张开；我因耶和华的救恩欢欣。
{1Sa 2:2}   "There is none holy like the LORD: for there is none besides you; there is no rock like our God.
{1Sa 2:2}   只有耶和华为圣；除他以外没有可比的，也没有磐石像我们的神。
{1Sa 2:3}   Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
{1Sa 2:3}   人不要夸口说骄傲的话，也不要出狂妄的言语；因耶和华是大有智识的神，人的行为被他衡量。
{1Sa 2:4}   The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble bind on strength.
{1Sa 2:4}   勇士的弓都已折断；跌倒的人以力量束腰。
{1Sa 2:5}   Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.
{1Sa 2:5}   素来饱足的，反作用人求食；饥饿的，再不饥饿。不生育的，生了七个儿子；多有儿女的，反倒衰微。
{1Sa 2:6}   The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.
{1Sa 2:6}   耶和华使人死，也使人活，使人下阴间，也使人往上升。
{1Sa 2:7}   The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts.
{1Sa 2:7}   他使人贫穷，也使人富足，使人卑微，也使人高贵。
{1Sa 2:8}   He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and on them he has set the world.
{1Sa 2:8}   他从灰尘里抬举贫寒人，从粪堆中提拔穷乏人，使他们与王子同坐，得着荣耀的座位。地的柱子属于耶和华；他将世界立在其上。
{1Sa 2:9}   "He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness, for not by might shall a man prevail.
{1Sa 2:9}   他必保护圣民的脚步，使恶人在黑暗中寂然不动；人都不能靠力量得胜。
{1Sa 2:10}  The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them he will thunder in heaven. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed."
{1Sa 2:10}  与耶和华争竞的，必被打碎；耶和华必从天上以雷攻击他，必审判地极的人，将力量赐与所立的王，高举受膏者的角。
{1Sa 2:11}  Then Elkanah went home to Ramah. And the boy was ministering to the LORD in the presence of Eli the priest.
{1Sa 2:11}  以利加拿往拉玛回家去了。那孩子在祭司以利面前事奉耶和华。
{1Sa 2:12}  Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know the LORD.
{1Sa 2:12}  以利的两个儿子是恶人，不认识耶和华。
{1Sa 2:13}  The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,
{1Sa 2:13}  这二祭司待百姓是这样的规矩：凡有人献祭，正煮肉的时候，祭司的仆人就来，手拿三齿的叉子，
{1Sa 2:14}  and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
{1Sa 2:14}  将叉子往罐里，或鼎里，或釜里，或锅里一插，插上来的肉，祭司都取了去。凡上到示罗的以色列人，他们都是这样看待。
{1Sa 2:15}  Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw."
{1Sa 2:15}  又在未烧脂油以前，祭司的仆人就来对献祭的人说：“将肉给祭司，叫他烤吧。他不要煮过的，要生的。”
{1Sa 2:16}  And if the man said to him, "Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish," he would say, "No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force."
{1Sa 2:16}  献祭的人若说：“必须先烧脂油，然后你可以随意取肉。”仆人就说：“你立时给我，不然我便抢去。”
{1Sa 2:17}  Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.
{1Sa 2:17}  如此，这二少年人的罪在耶和华面前甚重了，因为他们藐视耶和华的祭物（或作：他们使人厌弃给耶和华献祭）。
{1Sa 2:18}  Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy clothed with a linen ephod.
{1Sa 2:18}  那时，撒母耳还是孩子，穿着细麻布的以弗得，侍立在耶和华面前。
{1Sa 2:19}  And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
{1Sa 2:19}  他母亲每年为他做一件小外袍，同着丈夫上来献年祭的时候带来给他。
{1Sa 2:20}  Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, "May the LORD give you children by this woman for the petition she asked of the LORD." So then they would return to their home.
{1Sa 2:20}  以利为以利加拿和他的妻祝福，说：“愿耶和华由这妇人再赐你后裔，代替你从耶和华求来的孩子。”他们就回本乡去了。
{1Sa 2:21}  Indeed the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in the presence of the LORD.
{1Sa 2:21}  耶和华眷顾哈拿，他就怀孕生了三个儿子，两个女儿。那孩子撒母耳在耶和华面前渐渐长大。
{1Sa 2:22}  Now Eli was very old, and he kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
{1Sa 2:22}  以利年甚老迈，听见他两个儿子待以色列众人的事，又听见他们与会幕门前伺候的妇人苟合，
{1Sa 2:23}  And he said to them, "Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people.
{1Sa 2:23}  他就对他们说：“你们为何行这样的事呢？我从这众百姓听见你们的恶行。
{1Sa 2:24}  No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad.
{1Sa 2:24}  我儿啊，不可这样！我听见你们的风声不好，你们使耶和华的百姓犯了罪。
{1Sa 2:25}  If someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?" But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for it was the will of the LORD to put them to death.
{1Sa 2:25}  人若得罪人，有士师审判他；人若得罪耶和华，谁能为他祈求呢？”然而他们还是不听父亲的话，因为耶和华想要杀他们。
{1Sa 2:26}  Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and also with man.
{1Sa 2:26}  孩子撒母耳渐渐长大，耶和华与人越发喜爱他。
{1Sa 2:27}  And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Did I indeed reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt subject to the house of Pharaoh?
{1Sa 2:27}  有神人来见以利，对他说：“耶和华如此说：‘你祖父在埃及法老家作奴仆的时候，我不是向他们显现吗？
{1Sa 2:28}  Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel.
{1Sa 2:28}  在以色列众支派中，我不是拣选人作我的祭司，使他烧香，在我坛上献祭，在我面前穿以弗得，又将以色列人所献的火祭都赐给你父家吗？
{1Sa 2:29}  Why then do you scorn my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded for my dwelling, and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?'
{1Sa 2:29}  我所吩咐献在我居所的祭物，你们为何践踏？尊重你的儿子过于尊重我，将我民以色列所献美好的祭物肥己呢？’
{1Sa 2:30}  Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever,' but now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
{1Sa 2:30}  因此，耶和华以色列的神说：‘我曾说，你和你父家必永远行在我面前；现在我却说，决不容你们这样行。因为尊重我的，我必重看他；藐视我的，他必被轻视。
{1Sa 2:31}  Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your house.
{1Sa 2:31}  日子必到，我要折断你的膀臂和你父家的膀臂，使你家中没有一个老年人。
{1Sa 2:32}  Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed on Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.
{1Sa 2:32}  在神使以色列人享福的时候，你必看见我居所的败落。在你家中必永远没有一个老年人。
{1Sa 2:33}  The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart, and all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword of men.
{1Sa 2:33}  我必不从我坛前灭尽你家中的人；那未灭的必使你眼目干瘪、心中忧伤。你家中所生的人都必死在中年。
{1Sa 2:34}  And this that shall come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day.
{1Sa 2:34}  你的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈所遭遇的事可作你的证据：他们二人必一日同死。
{1Sa 2:35}  And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed forever.
{1Sa 2:35}  我要为自己立一个忠心的祭司；他必照我的心意而行。我要为他建立坚固的家；他必永远行在我的受膏者面前。
{1Sa 2:36}  And everyone who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and shall say, "Please put me in one of the priests' places, that I may eat a morsel of bread."'"
{1Sa 2:36}  你家所剩下的人都必来叩拜他，求块银子，求个饼，说：求你赐我祭司的职分，好叫我得点饼吃。’”
{1Sa 3:1}   Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD in the presence of Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.
{1Sa 3:1}   童子撒母耳在以利面前事奉耶和华。当那些日子，耶和华的言语稀少，不常有默示。
{1Sa 3:2}   At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place.
{1Sa 3:2}   一日，以利睡卧在自己的地方；他眼目昏花，看不分明。
{1Sa 3:3}   The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.
{1Sa 3:3}   神的灯在神耶和华殿内约柜那里，还没有熄灭，撒母耳已经睡了。
{1Sa 3:4}   Then the LORD called Samuel, and he said, "Here I am!"
{1Sa 3:4}   耶和华呼唤撒母耳。撒母耳说：“我在这里！”
{1Sa 3:5}   and ran to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he said, "I did not call; lie down again." So he went and lay down.
{1Sa 3:5}   就跑到以利那里，说：“你呼唤我？我在这里。”以利回答说：“我没有呼唤你，你去睡吧。”他就去睡了。
{1Sa 3:6}   And the LORD called again, "Samuel!" and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he said, "I did not call, my son; lie down again."
{1Sa 3:6}   耶和华又呼唤撒母耳。撒母耳起来，到以利那里，说：“你呼唤我？我在这里。”以利回答说：“我的儿，我没有呼唤你，你去睡吧。”
{1Sa 3:7}   Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.
{1Sa 3:7}   那时撒母耳还未认识耶和华，也未得耶和华的默示。
{1Sa 3:8}   And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy.
{1Sa 3:8}   耶和华第三次呼唤撒母耳。撒母耳起来，到以利那里，说：“你又呼唤我？我在这里。”以利才明白是耶和华呼唤童子。
{1Sa 3:9}   Therefore Eli said to Samuel, "Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, 'Speak, LORD, for your servant hears.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
{1Sa 3:9}   因此以利对撒母耳说：“你仍去睡吧；若再呼唤你，你就说：‘耶和华啊，请说，仆人敬听！’”撒母耳就去，仍睡在原处。
{1Sa 3:10}  And the LORD came and stood, calling as at other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant hears."
{1Sa 3:10}  耶和华又来站着，像前三次呼唤说：“撒母耳啊！撒母耳啊！”撒母耳回答说：“请说，仆人敬听！”
{1Sa 3:11}  Then the LORD said to Samuel, "Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.
{1Sa 3:11}  耶和华对撒母耳说：“我在以色列中必行一件事，叫听见的人都必耳鸣。
{1Sa 3:12}  On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.
{1Sa 3:12}  我指着以利家所说的话，到了时候，我必始终应验在以利身上。
{1Sa 3:13}  And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.
{1Sa 3:13}  我曾告诉他必永远降罚与他的家，因他知道儿子作孽，自招咒诅，却不禁止他们。
{1Sa 3:14}  Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever."
{1Sa 3:14}  所以我向以利家起誓说：‘以利家的罪孽，虽献祭奉礼物，永不能得赎去。’”
{1Sa 3:15}  Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.
{1Sa 3:15}  撒母耳睡到天亮，就开了耶和华的殿门，不敢将默示告诉以利。
{1Sa 3:16}  But Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." And he said, "Here I am."
{1Sa 3:16}  以利呼唤撒母耳说：“我儿撒母耳啊！”撒母耳回答说：“我在这里！”
{1Sa 3:17}  And Eli said, "What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that he told you."
{1Sa 3:17}  以利说：“耶和华对你说什么，你不要向我隐瞒；你若将神对你所说的隐瞒一句，愿他重重的降罚与你。”
{1Sa 3:18}  So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, "It is the LORD. Let him do what seems good to him."
{1Sa 3:18}  撒母耳就把一切话都告诉了以利，并没有隐瞒。以利说：“这是出于耶和华，愿他凭自己的意旨而行。”
{1Sa 3:19}  And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.
{1Sa 3:19}  撒母耳长大了，耶和华与他同在，使他所说的话一句都不落空。
{1Sa 3:20}  And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD.
{1Sa 3:20}  从但到别是巴所有的以色列人都知道耶和华立撒母耳为先知。
{1Sa 3:21}  And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
{1Sa 3:21}  耶和华又在示罗显现；因为耶和华将自己的话默示撒母耳，撒母耳就把这话传遍以色列地。
{1Sa 4:1}   And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines. They encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.
{1Sa 4:1}   以色列人出去与非利士人打仗，安营在以便以谢；非利士人安营在亚弗。
{1Sa 4:2}   The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle.
{1Sa 4:2}   非利士人向以色列人摆阵。两军交战的时候，以色列人败在非利士人面前；非利士人在战场上杀了他们的军兵约有四千人。
{1Sa 4:3}   And when the people came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here from Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies."
{1Sa 4:3}   百姓回到营里，以色列的长老说：“耶和华今日为何使我们败在非利士人面前呢？我们不如将耶和华的约柜从示罗抬到我们这里来，好在我们中间救我们脱离敌人的手。”
{1Sa 4:4}   So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
{1Sa 4:4}   于是百姓打发人到示罗，从那里将坐在二基路伯上万军之耶和华的约柜抬来。以利的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈与神的约柜同来。
{1Sa 4:5}   As soon as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.
{1Sa 4:5}   耶和华的约柜到了营中，以色列众人就大声欢呼，地便震动。
{1Sa 4:6}   And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, "What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?" And when they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp,
{1Sa 4:6}   非利士人听见欢呼的声音，就说：“在希伯来人营里大声欢呼，是什么缘故呢？”随后就知道耶和华的约柜到了营中。
{1Sa 4:7}   the Philistines were afraid, for they said, "A god has come into the camp." And they said, "Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.
{1Sa 4:7}   非利士人就惧怕起来，说：“有神到了他们营中”；又说：“我们有祸了！向来不曾有这样的事。
{1Sa 4:8}   Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.
{1Sa 4:8}   我们有祸了！谁能救我们脱离这些大能之神的手呢？从前在旷野用各样灾殃击打埃及人的，就是这些神。
{1Sa 4:9}   Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight."
{1Sa 4:9}   非利士人哪，你们要刚强，要作大丈夫，免得作希伯来人的奴仆，如同他们作你们的奴仆一样。你们要作大丈夫，与他们争战。”
{1Sa 4:10}  So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled, every man to his home. And there was a very great slaughter, for thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell.
{1Sa 4:10}  非利士人和以色列人打仗，以色列人败了，各向各家奔逃，被杀的人甚多，以色列的步兵仆倒了三万。
{1Sa 4:11}  And the ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
{1Sa 4:11}  神的约柜被掳去，以利的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈也都被杀了。
{1Sa 4:12}  A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head.
{1Sa 4:12}  当日，有一个便雅悯人从阵上逃跑，衣服撕裂，头蒙灰尘，来到示罗。
{1Sa 4:13}  When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out.
{1Sa 4:13}  到了的时候，以利正在道旁坐在自己的位上观望，为神的约柜心里担忧。那人进城报信，合城的人就都呼喊起来。
{1Sa 4:14}  When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, "What is this uproar?" Then the man hurried and came and told Eli.
{1Sa 4:14}  以利听见呼喊的声音就问说：“这喧嚷是什么缘故呢？”那人急忙来报信给以利。
{1Sa 4:15}  Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set so that he could not see.
{1Sa 4:15}  那时以利九十八岁了，眼目发直，不能看见。
{1Sa 4:16}  And the man said to Eli, "I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today." And he said, "How did it go, my son?"
{1Sa 4:16}  那人对以利说：“我是从阵上来的，今日我从阵上逃回。”以利说：“我儿，事情怎样？”
{1Sa 4:17}  He who brought the news answered and said, "Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great defeat among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."
{1Sa 4:17}  报信的回答说：“以色列人在非利士人面前逃跑，民中被杀的甚多！你的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈也都死了，并且神的约柜被掳去。”
{1Sa 4:18}  As soon as he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
{1Sa 4:18}  他一提神的约柜，以利就从他的位上往后跌倒，在门旁折断颈项而死；因为他年纪老迈，身体沉重。以利作以色列的士师四十年。
{1Sa 4:19}  Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, about to give birth. And when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth, for her pains came upon her.
{1Sa 4:19}  以利的儿妇、非尼哈的妻怀孕将到产期，他听见神的约柜被掳去，公公和丈夫都死了，就猛然疼痛，曲身生产；
{1Sa 4:20}  And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her, "Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son." But she did not answer or pay attention.
{1Sa 4:20}  将要死的时候，旁边站着的妇人们对他说：“不要怕！你生了男孩子了。”他却不回答，也不放在心上。
{1Sa 4:21}  And she named the child Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel!" because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
{1Sa 4:21}  他给孩子起名叫以迦博，说：“荣耀离开以色列了！”这是因神的约柜被掳去，又因他公公和丈夫都死了。
{1Sa 4:22}  And she said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."
{1Sa 4:22}  他又说：“荣耀离开以色列，因为神的约柜被掳去了。”
{1Sa 5:1}   When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
{1Sa 5:1}   非利士人将神的约柜从以便以谢抬到亚实突。
{1Sa 5:2}   Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it up beside Dagon.
{1Sa 5:2}   非利士人将神的约柜抬进大衮庙，放在大衮的旁边。
{1Sa 5:3}   And when the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and put him back in his place.
{1Sa 5:3}   次日清早，亚实突人起来，见大衮仆倒在耶和华的约柜前，脸伏于地，就把大衮仍立在原处。
{1Sa 5:4}   But when they rose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.
{1Sa 5:4}   又次日清早起来，见大衮仆倒在耶和华的约柜前，脸伏于地，并且大衮的头和两手都在门槛上折断，只剩下大衮的残体。
{1Sa 5:5}   This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
{1Sa 5:5}   （因此，大衮的祭司和一切进亚实突、大衮庙的人都不踏大衮庙的门槛，直到今日。）
{1Sa 5:6}   The hand of the LORD was heavy against the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and afflicted them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory.
{1Sa 5:6}   耶和华的手重重加在亚实突人身上，败坏他们，使他们生痔疮。亚实突和亚实突的四境都是如此。
{1Sa 5:7}   And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, "The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is hard against us and against Dagon our god."
{1Sa 5:7}   亚实突人见这光景，就说：“以色列神的约柜不可留在我们这里，因为他的手重重加在我们和我们神大衮的身上”；
{1Sa 5:8}   So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" They answered, "Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath." So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there.
{1Sa 5:8}   就打发人去请非利士的众首领来聚集，问他们说：“我们向以色列神的约柜应当怎样行呢？”他们回答说：“可以将以色列神的约柜运到迦特去。”于是将以色列神的约柜运到那里去。
{1Sa 5:9}   But after they had brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing a very great panic, and he afflicted the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them.
{1Sa 5:9}   运到之后，耶和华的手攻击那城，使那城的人大大惊慌，无论大小都生痔疮。
{1Sa 5:10}  So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But as soon as the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people."
{1Sa 5:10}  他们就把神的约柜送到以革伦。神的约柜到了，以革伦人就喊嚷起来说：“他们将以色列神的约柜运到我们这里，要害我们和我们的众民！”
{1Sa 5:11}  They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people." For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city. The hand of God was very heavy there.
{1Sa 5:11}  于是打发人去请非利士的众首领来，说：“愿你们将以色列神的约柜送回原处，免得害了我们和我们的众民！”原来神的手重重攻击那城，城中的人有因惊慌而死的；
{1Sa 5:12}  The men who did not die were struck with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
{1Sa 5:12}  未曾死的人都生了痔疮。合城呼号，声音上达于天。
{1Sa 6:1}   The ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
{1Sa 6:1}   耶和华的约柜在非利士人之地七个月。
{1Sa 6:2}   And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place."
{1Sa 6:2}   非利士人将祭司和占卜的聚了来，问他们说：“我们向耶和华的约柜应当怎样行？请指示我们用何法将约柜送回原处。”
{1Sa 6:3}   They said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand does not turn away from you."
{1Sa 6:3}   他们说：“若要将以色列神的约柜送回去，不可空空地送去，必要给他献赔罪的礼物，然后你们可得痊愈，并知道他的手为何不离开你们。”
{1Sa 6:4}   And they said, "What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?" They answered, "Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for the same plague was on all of you and on your lords.
{1Sa 6:4}   非利士人说：“应当用什么献为赔罪的礼物呢？”他们回答说：“当照非利士首领的数目，用五个金痔疮，五个金老鼠，因为在你们众人和你们首领的身上都是一样的灾。
{1Sa 6:5}   So you must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you and your gods and your land.
{1Sa 6:5}   所以当制造你们痔疮的像和毁坏你们田地老鼠的像，并要归荣耀给以色列的神，或者他向你们和你们的神，并你们的田地，把手放轻些。
{1Sa 6:6}   Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had dealt severely with them, did they not send the people away, and they departed?
{1Sa 6:6}   你们为何硬着心像埃及人和法老一样呢？神在埃及人中间行奇事，埃及人岂不释放以色列人，他们就去了吗？
{1Sa 6:7}   Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milk cows on which there has never come a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them.
{1Sa 6:7}   现在你们应当造一辆新车，将两只未曾负轭有乳的母牛套在车上，使牛犊回家去，离开母牛。
{1Sa 6:8}   And take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart and put in a box at its side the figures of gold, which you are returning to him as a guilt offering. Then send it off and let it go its way
{1Sa 6:8}   把耶和华的约柜放在车上，将所献赔罪的金物装在匣子里，放在柜旁，将柜送去。
{1Sa 6:9}   and watch. If it goes up on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm, but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it happened to us by coincidence."
{1Sa 6:9}   你们要看看：车若直行以色列的境界到伯示麦去，这大灾就是耶和华降在我们身上的；若不然，便可以知道不是他的手击打我们，是我们偶然遇见的。”
{1Sa 6:10}  The men did so, and took two milk cows and yoked them to the cart and shut up their calves at home.
{1Sa 6:10}  非利士人就这样行：将两只有乳的母牛套在车上，将牛犊关在家里，
{1Sa 6:11}  And they put the ark of the LORD on the cart and the box with the golden mice and the images of their tumors.
{1Sa 6:11}  把耶和华的约柜和装金老鼠并金痔疮像的匣子都放在车上。
{1Sa 6:12}  And the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh along one highway, lowing as they went. They turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.
{1Sa 6:12}  牛直行大道，往伯示麦去，一面走一面叫，不偏左右。非利士的首领跟在后面，直到伯示麦的境界。
{1Sa 6:13}  Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And when they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it.
{1Sa 6:13}  伯示麦人正在平原收割麦子，举目看见约柜，就欢喜了。
{1Sa 6:14}  The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. A great stone was there. And they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
{1Sa 6:14}  车到了伯示麦人约书亚的田间，就站住了。在那里有一块大磐石，他们把车劈了，将两只母牛献给耶和华为燔祭。
{1Sa 6:15}  And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was beside it, in which were the golden figures, and set them upon the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices on that day to the LORD.
{1Sa 6:15}  利未人将耶和华的约柜和装金物的匣子拿下来，放在大磐石上。当日伯示麦人将燔祭和平安祭献给耶和华。
{1Sa 6:16}  And when the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned that day to Ekron.
{1Sa 6:16}  非利士人的五个首领看见，当日就回以革伦去了。
{1Sa 6:17}  These are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron,
{1Sa 6:17}  非利士人献给耶和华作赔罪的金痔疮像，就是这些：一个是为亚实突，一个是为迦萨，一个是为亚实基伦，一个是为迦特，一个是为以革伦。
{1Sa 6:18}  and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and unwalled villages. The great stone beside which they set down the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.
{1Sa 6:18}  金老鼠的数目是照非利士五个首领的城邑，就是坚固的城邑和乡村，以及大磐石。这磐石是放耶和华约柜的，到今日还在伯示麦人约书亚的田间。
{1Sa 6:19}  And he struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they looked upon the ark of the LORD. He struck seventy men of them, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great blow.
{1Sa 6:19}  耶和华因伯示麦人擅观他的约柜，就击杀了他们七十人；那时有五万人在那里（原文作七十人加五万人）。百姓因耶和华大大击杀他们，就哀哭了。
{1Sa 6:20}  Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, "Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall he go up away from us?"
{1Sa 6:20}  伯示麦人说：“谁能在耶和华这圣洁的神面前侍立呢？这约柜可以从我们这里送到谁那里去呢？”
{1Sa 6:21}  So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to you."
{1Sa 6:21}  于是打发人去见基列耶琳的居民，说：“非利士人将耶和华的约柜送回来了，你们下来将约柜接到你们那里去吧！”
{1Sa 7:1}   And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the LORD and brought it to the house of Abinadab on the hill. And they consecrated his son Eleazar to have charge of the ark of the LORD.
{1Sa 7:1}   基列耶琳人就下来，将耶和华的约柜接上去，放在山上亚比拿达的家中，分派他儿子以利亚撒看守耶和华的约柜。
{1Sa 7:2}   From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
{1Sa 7:2}   约柜在基列耶琳许久。过了二十年，以色列全家都倾向耶和华。
{1Sa 7:3}   And Samuel said to all the house of Israel, "If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you and direct your heart to the LORD and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
{1Sa 7:3}   撒母耳对以色列全家说：“你们若一心归顺耶和华，就要把外邦的神和亚斯他录从你们中间除掉，专心归向耶和华，单单地事奉他。他必救你们脱离非利士人的手。”
{1Sa 7:4}   So the people of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and they served the LORD only.
{1Sa 7:4}   以色列人就除掉诸巴力和亚斯他录，单单地事奉耶和华。
{1Sa 7:5}   Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you."
{1Sa 7:5}   撒母耳说：“要使以色列众人聚集在米斯巴，我好为你们祷告耶和华。”
{1Sa 7:6}   So they gathered at Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before the LORD and fasted on that day and said there, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.
{1Sa 7:6}   他们就聚集在米斯巴，打水浇在耶和华面前，当日禁食，说：“我们得罪了耶和华。”于是撒母耳在米斯巴审判以色列人。
{1Sa 7:7}   Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
{1Sa 7:7}   非利士人听见以色列人聚集在米斯巴，非利士的首领就上来要攻击以色列人。以色列人听见，就惧怕非利士人。
{1Sa 7:8}   And the people of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines."
{1Sa 7:8}   以色列人对撒母耳说：“愿你不住地为我们呼求耶和华我们的神，救我们脱离非利士人的手。”
{1Sa 7:9}   So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. And Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.
{1Sa 7:9}   撒母耳就把一只吃奶的羊羔献与耶和华作全牲的燔祭，为以色列人呼求耶和华；耶和华就应允他。
{1Sa 7:10}  As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel. But the LORD thundered with a mighty sound that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel.
{1Sa 7:10}  撒母耳正献燔祭的时候，非利士人前来要与以色列人争战。当日，耶和华大发雷声，惊乱非利士人，他们就败在以色列人面前。
{1Sa 7:11}  And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them, as far as below Beth-car.
{1Sa 7:11}  以色列人从米斯巴出来，追赶非利士人，击杀他们，直到伯甲的下边。
{1Sa 7:12}  Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen and called its name Ebenezer; for he said, "Till now the LORD has helped us."
{1Sa 7:12}  撒母耳将一块石头立在米斯巴和善的中间，给石头起名叫以便以谢，说：“到如今耶和华都帮助我们。”
{1Sa 7:13}  So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
{1Sa 7:13}  从此，非利士人就被制伏，不敢再入以色列人的境内。撒母耳作士师的时候，耶和华的手攻击非利士人。
{1Sa 7:14}  The cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.
{1Sa 7:14}  非利士人所取以色列人的城邑，从以革伦直到迦特，都归以色列人了。属这些城的四境，以色列人也从非利士人手下收回。那时以色列人与亚摩利人和好。
{1Sa 7:15}  Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
{1Sa 7:15}  撒母耳平生作以色列的士师。
{1Sa 7:16}  And he went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. And he judged Israel in all these places.
{1Sa 7:16}  他每年巡行到伯特利、吉甲、米斯巴，在这几处审判以色列人。
{1Sa 7:17}  Then he would return to Ramah, for his home was there, and there also he judged Israel. And he built there an altar to the LORD.
{1Sa 7:17}  随后回到拉玛，因为他的家在那里；也在那里审判以色列人，且为耶和华筑了一座坛。
{1Sa 8:1}   When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel.
{1Sa 8:1}   撒母耳年纪老迈，就立他儿子作以色列的士师。
{1Sa 8:2}   The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba.
{1Sa 8:2}   长子名叫约珥，次子名叫亚比亚；他们在别是巴作士师。
{1Sa 8:3}   Yet his sons did not walk in his ways but turned aside after gain. They took bribes and perverted justice.
{1Sa 8:3}   他儿子不行他的道，贪图财利，收受贿赂，屈枉正直。
{1Sa 8:4}   Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah
{1Sa 8:4}   以色列的长老都聚集，来到拉玛见撒母耳，
{1Sa 8:5}   and said to him, "Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations."
{1Sa 8:5}   对他说：“你年纪老迈了，你儿子不行你的道。现在求你为我们立一个王治理我们，像列国一样。”
{1Sa 8:6}   But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." And Samuel prayed to the LORD.
{1Sa 8:6}   撒母耳不喜悦他们说“立一个王治理我们”，他就祷告耶和华。
{1Sa 8:7}   And the LORD said to Samuel, "Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.
{1Sa 8:7}   耶和华对撒母耳说：“百姓向你说的一切话，你只管依从；因为他们不是厌弃你，乃是厌弃我，不要我作他们的王。
{1Sa 8:8}   According to all the deeds that they have done, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are also doing to you.
{1Sa 8:8}   自从我领他们出埃及到如今，他们常常离弃我，事奉别神。现在他们向你所行的，是照他们素来所行的。
{1Sa 8:9}   Now then, obey their voice; only you shall solemnly warn them and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them."
{1Sa 8:9}   故此你要依从他们的话，只是当警戒他们，告诉他们将来那王怎样管辖他们。”
{1Sa 8:10}  So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking for a king from him.
{1Sa 8:10}  撒母耳将耶和华的话都传给求他立王的百姓，说：
{1Sa 8:11}  He said, "These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots.
{1Sa 8:11}  “管辖你们的王必这样行：他必派你们的儿子为他赶车、跟马，奔走在车前；
{1Sa 8:12}  And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.
{1Sa 8:12}  又派他们作千夫长、五十夫长，为他耕种田地，收割庄稼，打造军器和车上的器械；
{1Sa 8:13}  He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.
{1Sa 8:13}  必取你们的女儿为他制造香膏，做饭烤饼；
{1Sa 8:14}  He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants.
{1Sa 8:14}  也必取你们最好的田地、葡萄园、橄榄园赐给他的臣仆。
{1Sa 8:15}  He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.
{1Sa 8:15}  你们的粮食和葡萄园所出的，他必取十分之一给他的太监和臣仆；
{1Sa 8:16}  He will take your male servants and female servants and the best of your young men and your donkeys, and put them to his work.
{1Sa 8:16}  又必取你们的仆人婢女，健壮的少年人和你们的驴，供他的差役。
{1Sa 8:17}  He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.
{1Sa 8:17}  你们的羊群，他必取十分之一，你们也必作他的仆人。
{1Sa 8:18}  And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you in that day."
{1Sa 8:18}  那时你们必因所选的王哀求耶和华，耶和华却不应允你们。”
{1Sa 8:19}  But the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel. And they said, "No! But there shall be a king over us,
{1Sa 8:19}  百姓竟不肯听撒母耳的话，说：“不然！我们定要一个王治理我们，
{1Sa 8:20}  that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles."
{1Sa 8:20}  使我们像列国一样，有王治理我们，统领我们，为我们争战。”
{1Sa 8:21}  And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.
{1Sa 8:21}  撒母耳听见百姓这一切话，就将这话陈明在耶和华面前。
{1Sa 8:22}  And the LORD said to Samuel, "Obey their voice and make them a king." Samuel then said to the men of Israel, "Go every man to his city."
{1Sa 8:22}  耶和华对撒母耳说：“你只管依从他们的话，为他们立王。”撒母耳对以色列人说：“你们各归各城去吧！”
{1Sa 9:1}   There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth.
{1Sa 9:1}   有一个便雅悯人，名叫基士，是便雅悯人亚斐亚的玄孙，比歌拉的曾孙，洗罗的孙子，亚别的儿子，是个大能的勇士（或作：大财主）。
{1Sa 9:2}   And he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.
{1Sa 9:2}   他有一个儿子，名叫扫罗，又健壮、又俊美，在以色列人中没有一个能比他的；身体比众民高过一头。
{1Sa 9:3}   Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. So Kish said to Saul his son, "Take one of the young men with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys."
{1Sa 9:3}   扫罗的父亲基士丢了几头驴，他就吩咐儿子扫罗说：“你带一个仆人去寻找驴。”
{1Sa 9:4}   And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. And they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then they passed through the land of Benjamin, but did not find them.
{1Sa 9:4}   扫罗就走过以法莲山地，又过沙利沙地，都没有找着；又过沙琳地，驴也不在那里；又过便雅悯地，还没有找着。
{1Sa 9:5}   When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, let us go back, lest my father cease to care about the donkeys and become anxious about us."
{1Sa 9:5}   到了苏弗地，扫罗对跟随他的仆人说：“我们不如回去，恐怕我父亲不为驴挂心，反为我们担忧。”
{1Sa 9:6}   But he said to him, "Behold, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says comes true. So now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us the way we should go."
{1Sa 9:6}   仆人说：“这城里有一位神人，是众人所尊重的，凡他所说的全都应验。我们不如往他那里去，或者他能将我们当走的路指示我们。”
{1Sa 9:7}   Then Saul said to his servant, "But if we go, what can we bring the man? For the bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?"
{1Sa 9:7}   扫罗对仆人说：“我们若去，有什么可以送那人呢？我们囊中的食物都吃尽了，也没有礼物可以送那神人，我们还有什么没有？”
{1Sa 9:8}   The servant answered Saul again, "Here, I have with me a quarter of a shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God to tell us our way."
{1Sa 9:8}   仆人回答扫罗说：“我手里有银子一舍客勒的四分之一，可以送那神人，请他指示我们当走的路。”
{1Sa 9:9}   (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, "Come, let us go to the seer," for today's "prophet" was formerly called a seer.)
{1Sa 9:9}   （从前以色列中，若有人去问神，就说：“我们问先见去吧！”现在称为“先知”的，从前称为“先见”。）
{1Sa 9:10}  And Saul said to his servant, "Well said; come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.
{1Sa 9:10}  扫罗对仆人说：“你说的是，我们可以去。”于是他们往神人所住的城里去了。
{1Sa 9:11}  As they went up the hill to the city, they met young women coming out to draw water and said to them, "Is the seer here?"
{1Sa 9:11}  他们上坡要进城，就遇见几个少年女子出来打水，问他们说：“先见在这里没有？”
{1Sa 9:12}  They answered, "He is; behold, he is just ahead of you. Hurry. He has come just now to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.
{1Sa 9:12}  女子回答说：“在这里，他在你们前面。快去吧！他今日正到城里，因为今日百姓要在邱坛献祭。
{1Sa 9:13}  As soon as you enter the city you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat till he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now go up, for you will meet him immediately."
{1Sa 9:13}  在他还没有上邱坛吃祭物之先，你们一进城必遇见他；因他未到，百姓不能吃，必等他先祝祭，然后请的客才吃。现在你们上去，这时候必遇见他。”
{1Sa 9:14}  So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.
{1Sa 9:14}  二人就上去；将进城的时候，撒母耳正迎着他们来，要上邱坛去。
{1Sa 9:15}  Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed to Samuel:
{1Sa 9:15}  扫罗未到的前一日，耶和华已经指示撒母耳说：
{1Sa 9:16}  "Tomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He shall save my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen my people, because their cry has come to me."
{1Sa 9:16}  “明日这时候，我必使一个人从便雅悯地到你这里来，你要膏他作我民以色列的君。他必救我民脱离非利士人的手；因我民的哀声上达于我，我就眷顾他们。”
{1Sa 9:17}  When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, "Here is the man of whom I spoke to you! He it is who shall restrain my people."
{1Sa 9:17}  撒母耳看见扫罗的时候，耶和华对他说：“看哪，这人就是我对你所说的，他必治理我的民。”
{1Sa 9:18}  Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate and said, "Tell me where is the house of the seer?"
{1Sa 9:18}  扫罗在城门里走到撒母耳跟前，说：“请告诉我，先见的寓所在那里？”
{1Sa 9:19}  Samuel answered Saul, "I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for today you shall eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind.
{1Sa 9:19}  撒母耳回答说：“我就是先见。你在我前面上邱坛去，因为你们今日必与我同席；明日早晨我送你去，将你心里的事都告诉你。
{1Sa 9:20}  As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father's house?"
{1Sa 9:20}  至于你前三日所丢的那几头驴，你心里不必挂念，已经找着了。以色列众人所仰慕的是谁呢？不是仰慕你和你父的全家吗？”
{1Sa 9:21}  Saul answered, "Am I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my clan the humblest of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?"
{1Sa 9:21}  扫罗说：“我不是以色列支派中至小的便雅悯人吗？我家不是便雅悯支派中至小的家吗？你为何对我说这样的话呢？”
{1Sa 9:22}  Then Samuel took Saul and his young man and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited, who were about thirty persons.
{1Sa 9:22}  撒母耳领扫罗和他仆人进了客堂，使他们在请来的客中坐首位；客约有三十个人。
{1Sa 9:23}  And Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion I gave you, of which I said to you, 'Put it aside.'"
{1Sa 9:23}  撒母耳对厨役说：“我交给你收存的那一分祭肉现在可以拿来。”
{1Sa 9:24}  So the cook took up the leg and what was on it and set them before Saul. And Samuel said, "See, what was kept is set before you. Eat, because it was kept for you until the hour appointed, that you might eat with the guests." So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
{1Sa 9:24}  厨役就把收存的腿拿来，摆在扫罗面前，撒母耳说：“这是所留下的，放在你面前。吃吧！因我请百姓的时候，特意为你存留这肉到此时。”当日，扫罗就与撒母耳同席。
{1Sa 9:25}  And when they came down from the high place into the city, a bed was spread for Saul on the roof, and he lay down to sleep.
{1Sa 9:25}  众人从邱坛下来进城，撒母耳和扫罗在房顶上说话。
{1Sa 9:26}  Then at the break of dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Up, that I may send you on your way." So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.
{1Sa 9:26}  次日清早起来，黎明的时候，扫罗在房顶上。撒母耳呼叫他说：“起来吧，我好送你回去。”扫罗就起来，和撒母耳一同出去。
{1Sa 9:27}  As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to pass on before us, and when he has passed on, stop here yourself for a while, that I may make known to you the word of God."
{1Sa 9:27}  二人下到城角，撒母耳对扫罗说：“要吩咐仆人先走（仆人就先走了）；你且站在这里，等我将神的话传与你听。”
{1Sa 10:1}  Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head and kissed him and said, "Has not the LORD anointed you to be prince over his people Israel? And you shall reign over the people of the LORD and you will save them from the hand of their surrounding enemies. And this shall be the sign to you that the LORD has anointed you to be prince over his heritage.
{1Sa 10:1}  撒母耳拿瓶膏油倒在扫罗的头上，与他亲嘴，说：“这不是耶和华膏你作他产业的君吗？
{1Sa 10:2}  When you depart from me today, you will meet two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, 'The donkeys that you went to seek are found, and now your father has ceased to care about the donkeys and is anxious about you, saying, "What shall I do about my son?"'
{1Sa 10:2}  你今日与我离别之后，在便雅悯境内的泄撒，靠近拉结的坟墓，要遇见两个人。他们必对你说：‘你去找的那几头驴已经找着了。现在你父亲不为驴挂心，反为你担忧，说：我为儿子怎么才好呢？’
{1Sa 10:3}  Then you shall go on from there farther and come to the oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.
{1Sa 10:3}  你从那里往前行，到了他泊的橡树那里，必遇见三个往伯特利去拜神的人：一个带着三只山羊羔，一个带着三个饼，一个带着一皮袋酒。
{1Sa 10:4}  And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand.
{1Sa 10:4}  他们必问你安，给你两个饼，你就从他们手中接过来。
{1Sa 10:5}  After that you shall come to Gibeath-elohim, where there is a garrison of the Philistines. And there, as soon as you come to the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, prophesying.
{1Sa 10:5}  此后你到神的山，在那里有非利士人的防兵。你到了城的时候，必遇见一班先知从邱坛下来，前面有鼓瑟的、击鼓的、吹笛的、弹琴的，他们都受感说话。
{1Sa 10:6}  Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man.
{1Sa 10:6}  耶和华的灵必大大感动你，你就与他们一同受感说话；你要变为新人。
{1Sa 10:7}  Now when these signs meet you, do what your hand finds to do, for God is with you.
{1Sa 10:7}  这兆头临到你，你就可以趁时而做，因为神与你同在。
{1Sa 10:8}  Then go down before me to Gilgal. And behold, I am coming down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do."
{1Sa 10:8}  你当在我以先下到吉甲，我也必下到那里献燔祭和平安祭。你要等候七日，等我到了那里，指示你当行的事。”
{1Sa 10:9}  When he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart. And all these signs came to pass that day.
{1Sa 10:9}  扫罗转身离别撒母耳，神就赐他一个新心。当日这一切兆头都应验了。
{1Sa 10:10} When they came to Gibeah, behold, a group of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them.
{1Sa 10:10} 扫罗到了那山，有一班先知遇见他，神的灵大大感动他，他就在先知中受感说话。
{1Sa 10:11} And when all who knew him previously saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, "What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
{1Sa 10:11} 素来认识扫罗的，看见他和先知一同受感说话，就彼此说：“基士的儿子遇见什么了？扫罗也列在先知中吗？”
{1Sa 10:12} And a man of the place answered, "And who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
{1Sa 10:12} 那地方有一个人说：“这些人的父亲是谁呢？”此后有句俗语说：“扫罗也列在先知中吗？”
{1Sa 10:13} When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
{1Sa 10:13} 扫罗受感说话已毕，就上邱坛去了。
{1Sa 10:14} Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, "Where did you go?" And he said, "To seek the donkeys. And when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel."
{1Sa 10:14} 扫罗的叔叔问扫罗和他仆人说：“你们往那里去了？”回答说：“找驴去了。我们见没有驴，就到了撒母耳那里。”
{1Sa 10:15} And Saul's uncle said, "Please tell me what Samuel said to you."
{1Sa 10:15} 扫罗的叔叔说：“请将撒母耳向你们所说的话告诉我。”
{1Sa 10:16} And Saul said to his uncle, "He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found." But about the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him anything.
{1Sa 10:16} 扫罗对他叔叔说：“他明明的告诉我们驴已经找着了。”至于撒母耳所说的国事，扫罗却没有告诉叔叔。
{1Sa 10:17} Now Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah.
{1Sa 10:17} 撒母耳将百姓招聚到米斯巴耶和华那里，
{1Sa 10:18} And he said to the people of Israel, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.'
{1Sa 10:18} 对他们说：“耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘我领你们以色列人出埃及，救你们脱离埃及人的手，又救你们脱离欺压你们各国之人的手。’
{1Sa 10:19} But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses, and you have said to him, 'Set a king over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your thousands."
{1Sa 10:19} 你们今日却厌弃了救你们脱离一切灾难的神，说：‘求你立一个王治理我们。’现在你们应当按着支派、宗族都站在耶和华面前。”
{1Sa 10:20} Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.
{1Sa 10:20} 于是，撒母耳使以色列众支派近前来掣签，就掣出便雅悯支派来；
{1Sa 10:21} He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was taken by lot; and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot. But when they sought him, he could not be found.
{1Sa 10:21} 又使便雅悯支派按着宗族近前来，就掣出玛特利族，从其中又掣出基士的儿子扫罗。众人寻找他却寻不着。
{1Sa 10:22} So they inquired again of the LORD, "Is there a man still to come?" and the LORD said, "Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage."
{1Sa 10:22} 就问耶和华说：“那人到这里来了没有？”耶和华说：“他藏在器具中了。”
{1Sa 10:23} Then they ran and took him from there. And when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.
{1Sa 10:23} 众人就跑去从那里领出他来。他站在百姓中间，身体比众民高过一头。
{1Sa 10:24} And Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? There is none like him among all the people." And all the people shouted, "Long live the king!"
{1Sa 10:24} 撒母耳对众民说：“你们看耶和华所拣选的人，众民中有可比他的吗？”众民就大声欢呼说：“愿王万岁！”
{1Sa 10:25} Then Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship, and he wrote them in a book and laid it up before the LORD. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his home.
{1Sa 10:25} 撒母耳将国法对百姓说明，又记在书上，放在耶和华面前，然后遣散众民，各回各家去了。
{1Sa 10:26} Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched.
{1Sa 10:26} 扫罗往基比亚回家去，有神感动的一群人跟随他。
{1Sa 10:27} But some worthless fellows said, "How can this man save us?" And they despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace.
{1Sa 10:27} 但有些匪徒说：“这人怎能救我们呢？”就藐视他，没有送他礼物；扫罗却不理会。
{1Sa 11:1}  Then Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead, and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you."
{1Sa 11:1}  亚扪人的王拿辖上来，对着基列雅比安营。雅比众人对拿辖说：“你与我们立约，我们就服事你。”
{1Sa 11:2}  But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, "On this condition I will make a treaty with you, that I gouge out all your right eyes, and thus bring disgrace on all Israel."
{1Sa 11:2}  亚扪人拿辖说：“你们若由我剜出你们各人的右眼，以此凌辱以色列众人，我就与你们立约。”
{1Sa 11:3}  The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Give us seven days' respite that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will give ourselves up to you."
{1Sa 11:3}  雅比的长老对他说：“求你宽容我们七日，等我们打发人往以色列的全境去；若没有人救我们，我们就出来归顺你。”
{1Sa 11:4}  When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, they reported the matter in the ears of the people, and all the people wept aloud.
{1Sa 11:4}  使者到了扫罗住的基比亚，将这话说给百姓听，百姓就都放声而哭。
{1Sa 11:5}  Now, behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen. And Saul said, "What is wrong with the people, that they are weeping?" So they told him the news of the men of Jabesh.
{1Sa 11:5}  扫罗正从田间赶牛回来，问说：“百姓为什么哭呢？”众人将雅比人的话告诉他。
{1Sa 11:6}  And the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled.
{1Sa 11:6}  扫罗听见这话，就被神的灵大大感动，甚是发怒。
{1Sa 11:7}  He took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, "Whoever does not come out after Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen!" Then the dread of the LORD fell upon the people, and they came out as one man.
{1Sa 11:7}  他将一对牛切成块子，托付使者传送以色列的全境，说：“凡不出来跟随扫罗和撒母耳的，也必这样切开他的牛。”于是耶和华使百姓惧怕，他们就都出来，如同一人。
{1Sa 11:8}  When he mustered them at Bezek, the people of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
{1Sa 11:8}  扫罗在比色数点他们：以色列人有三十万，犹大人有三万。
{1Sa 11:9}  And they said to the messengers who had come, "Thus shall you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have salvation.'" When the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, they were glad.
{1Sa 11:9}  众人对那使者说：“你们要回覆基列雅比人说，明日太阳近午的时候，你们必得解救。”使者回去告诉雅比人，他们就欢喜了。
{1Sa 11:10} Therefore the men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will give ourselves up to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you."
{1Sa 11:10} 于是雅比人对亚扪人说：“明日我们出来归顺你们，你们可以随意待我们。”
{1Sa 11:11} And the next day Saul put the people in three companies. And they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
{1Sa 11:11} 第二日，扫罗将百姓分为三队，在晨更的时候入了亚扪人的营，击杀他们直到太阳近午，剩下的人都逃散，没有二人同在一处的。
{1Sa 11:12} Then the people said to Samuel, "Who is it that said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring the men, that we may put them to death."
{1Sa 11:12} 百姓对撒母耳说：“那说‘扫罗岂能管理我们’的是谁呢？可以将他交出来，我们好杀死他。”
{1Sa 11:13} But Saul said, "Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has worked salvation in Israel."
{1Sa 11:13} 扫罗说：“今日耶和华在以色列中施行拯救，所以不可杀人。”
{1Sa 11:14} Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingdom."
{1Sa 11:14} 撒母耳对百姓说：“我们要往吉甲去，在那里立国。”
{1Sa 11:15} So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
{1Sa 11:15} 众百姓就到了吉甲那里，在耶和华面前立扫罗为王，又在耶和华面前献平安祭。扫罗和以色列众人大大欢喜。
{1Sa 12:1}  And Samuel said to all Israel, "Behold, I have obeyed your voice in all that you have said to me and have made a king over you.
{1Sa 12:1}  撒母耳对以色列众人说：“你们向我所求的，我已应允了，为你们立了一个王；
{1Sa 12:2}  And now, behold, the king walks before you, and I am old and gray; and behold, my sons are with you. I have walked before you from my youth until this day.
{1Sa 12:2}  现在有这王在你们前面行。我已年老发白，我的儿子都在你们这里。我从幼年直到今日都在你们前面行。
{1Sa 12:3}  Here I am; testify against me before the LORD and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me and I will restore it to you."
{1Sa 12:3}  我在这里，你们要在耶和华和他的受膏者面前给我作见证。我夺过谁的牛，抢过谁的驴，欺负过谁，虐待过谁，从谁手里受过贿赂因而眼瞎呢？若有，我必偿还。”
{1Sa 12:4}  They said, "You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man's hand."
{1Sa 12:4}  众人说：“你未曾欺负我们，虐待我们，也未曾从谁手里受过什么。”
{1Sa 12:5}  And he said to them, "The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand." And they said, "He is witness."
{1Sa 12:5}  撒母耳对他们说：“你们在我手里没有找着什么，有耶和华和他的受膏者今日为证。”他们说：“愿他为证。”
{1Sa 12:6}  And Samuel said to the people, "The LORD is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
{1Sa 12:6}  撒母耳对百姓说：“从前立摩西、亚伦，又领你们列祖出埃及地的是耶和华。
{1Sa 12:7}  Now therefore stand still that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous deeds of the LORD that he performed for you and for your fathers.
{1Sa 12:7}  现在你们要站住，等我在耶和华面前对你们讲论耶和华向你们和你们列祖所行一切公义的事。
{1Sa 12:8}  When Jacob went into Egypt, and the Egyptians oppressed them, then your fathers cried out to the LORD and the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place.
{1Sa 12:8}  从前雅各到了埃及，后来你们列祖呼求耶和华，耶和华就差遣摩西、亚伦领你们列祖出埃及，使他们在这地方居住。
{1Sa 12:9}  But they forgot the LORD their God. And he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab. And they fought against them.
{1Sa 12:9}  他们却忘记耶和华他们的神，他就把他们付与夏琐将军西西拉的手里，和非利士人并摩押王的手里。于是这些人常来攻击他们。
{1Sa 12:10} And they cried out to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, that we may serve you.'
{1Sa 12:10} 他们就呼求耶和华说：‘我们离弃耶和华，事奉巴力和亚斯他录，是有罪了。现在求你救我们脱离仇敌的手，我们必事奉你。’
{1Sa 12:11} And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived in safety.
{1Sa 12:11} 耶和华就差遣耶路巴力、比但、耶弗他、撒母耳救你们脱离四围仇敌的手，你们才安然居住。
{1Sa 12:12} And when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us,' when the LORD your God was your king.
{1Sa 12:12} 你们见亚扪人的王拿辖来攻击你们，就对我说：‘我们定要一个王治理我们。’其实耶和华你们的神是你们的王。
{1Sa 12:13} And now behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; behold, the LORD has set a king over you.
{1Sa 12:13} 现在，你们所求所选的王在这里。看哪，耶和华已经为你们立王了。
{1Sa 12:14} If you will fear the LORD and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God, it will be well.
{1Sa 12:14} 你们若敬畏耶和华，事奉他，听从他的话，不违背他的命令，你们和治理你们的王也都顺从耶和华你们的神就好了。
{1Sa 12:15} But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you and your king.
{1Sa 12:15} 倘若不听从耶和华的话，违背他的命令，耶和华的手必攻击你们，像从前攻击你们列祖一样。
{1Sa 12:16} Now therefore stand still and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes.
{1Sa 12:16} 现在你们要站住，看耶和华在你们眼前要行一件大事。
{1Sa 12:17} Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the LORD, that he may send thunder and rain. And you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking for yourselves a king."
{1Sa 12:17} 这不是割麦子的时候吗？我求告耶和华，他必打雷降雨，使你们又知道又看出，你们求立王的事是在耶和华面前犯大罪了。”
{1Sa 12:18} So Samuel called upon the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day, and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
{1Sa 12:18} 于是撒母耳求告耶和华，耶和华就在这日打雷降雨，众民便甚惧怕耶和华和撒母耳。
{1Sa 12:19} And all the people said to Samuel, "Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for ourselves a king."
{1Sa 12:19} 众民对撒母耳说：“求你为仆人们祷告耶和华你的神，免得我们死亡，因为我们求立王的事正是罪上加罪了。”
{1Sa 12:20} And Samuel said to the people, "Do not be afraid; you have done all this evil. Yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.
{1Sa 12:20} 撒母耳对百姓说：“不要惧怕！你们虽然行了这恶，却不要偏离耶和华，只要尽心事奉他。
{1Sa 12:21} And do not turn aside after empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are empty.
{1Sa 12:21} 若偏离耶和华去顺从那不能救人的虚神是无益的。
{1Sa 12:22} For the LORD will not forsake his people, for his great name's sake, because it has pleased the LORD to make you a people for himself.
{1Sa 12:22} 耶和华既喜悦选你们作他的子民，就必因他的大名不撇弃你们。
{1Sa 12:23} Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
{1Sa 12:23} 至于我，断不停止为你们祷告，以致得罪耶和华。我必以善道正路指教你们。
{1Sa 12:24} Only fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you.
{1Sa 12:24} 只要你们敬畏耶和华，诚诚实实地尽心事奉他，想念他向你们所行的事何等大。
{1Sa 12:25} But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king."
{1Sa 12:25} 你们若仍然作恶，你们和你们的王必一同灭亡。”
{1Sa 13:1}  Saul lived for one year and then became king, and when he had reigned for two years over Israel,
{1Sa 13:1}  扫罗登基年四十岁；作以色列王二年的时候，
{1Sa 13:2}  Saul chose three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent.
{1Sa 13:2}  就从以色列中拣选了三千人：二千跟随扫罗在密抹和伯特利山，一千跟随约拿单在便雅悯的基比亚；其余的人扫罗都打发各回各家去了。
{1Sa 13:3}  Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear."
{1Sa 13:3}  约拿单攻击迦巴、非利士人的防营，非利士人听见了。扫罗就在遍地吹角，意思说，要使希伯来人听见。
{1Sa 13:4}  And all Israel heard it said that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become a stench to the Philistines. And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.
{1Sa 13:4}  以色列众人听见扫罗攻击非利士人的防营，又听见以色列人为非利士人所憎恶，就跟随扫罗聚集在吉甲。
{1Sa 13:5}  And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven.
{1Sa 13:5}  非利士人聚集，要与以色列人争战，有车三万辆，马兵六千，步兵像海边的沙那样多，就上来在伯亚文东边的密抹安营。
{1Sa 13:6}  When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns,
{1Sa 13:6}  以色列百姓见自己危急窘迫，就藏在山洞、丛林、石穴、隐密处，和坑中。
{1Sa 13:7}  and some Hebrews crossed the fords of the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
{1Sa 13:7}  有些希伯来人过了约但河，逃到迦得和基列地。扫罗还是在吉甲，百姓都战战兢兢地跟随他。
{1Sa 13:8}  He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.
{1Sa 13:8}  扫罗照着撒母耳所定的日期等了七日。撒母耳还没有来到吉甲，百姓也离开扫罗散去了。
{1Sa 13:9}  So Saul said, "Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the peace offerings." And he offered the burnt offering.
{1Sa 13:9}  扫罗说：“把燔祭和平安祭带到我这里来。”扫罗就献上燔祭。
{1Sa 13:10} As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came. And Saul went out to meet him and greet him.
{1Sa 13:10} 刚献完燔祭，撒母耳就到了。扫罗出去迎接他，要问他好。
{1Sa 13:11} Samuel said, "What have you done?" And Saul said, "When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash,
{1Sa 13:11} 撒母耳说：“你做的是什么事呢？”扫罗说：“因为我见百姓离开我散去，你也不照所定的日期来到，而且非利士人聚集在密抹。
{1Sa 13:12} I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.' So I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering."
{1Sa 13:12} 所以我心里说：恐怕我没有祷告耶和华。非利士人下到吉甲攻击我，我就勉强献上燔祭。”
{1Sa 13:13} And Samuel said to Saul, "You have done foolishly. You have not kept the command of the LORD your God, with which he commanded you. For then the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
{1Sa 13:13} 撒母耳对扫罗说：“你做了糊涂事了，没有遵守耶和华你神所吩咐你的命令。若遵守，耶和华必在以色列中坚立你的王位，直到永远。
{1Sa 13:14} But now your kingdom shall not continue. The LORD has sought out a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you."
{1Sa 13:14} 现在你的王位必不长久。耶和华已经寻着一个合他心意的人，立他作百姓的君，因为你没有遵守耶和华所吩咐你的。”
{1Sa 13:15} And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal. The rest of the people went up after Saul to meet the army; they went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.
{1Sa 13:15} 撒母耳就起来，从吉甲上到便雅悯的基比亚。扫罗数点跟随他的，约有六百人。
{1Sa 13:16} And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them stayed in Geba of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
{1Sa 13:16} 扫罗和他儿子约拿单，并跟随他们的人，都住在便雅悯的迦巴；但非利士人安营在密抹。
{1Sa 13:17} And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
{1Sa 13:17} 有掠兵从非利士营中出来，分为三队：一队往俄弗拉向书亚地去，
{1Sa 13:18} another company turned toward Beth-horon; and another company turned toward the border that looks down on the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
{1Sa 13:18} 一队往伯和仑去，一队往洗波音谷对面的地境向旷野去。
{1Sa 13:19} Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, "Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears."
{1Sa 13:19} 那时，以色列全地没有一个铁匠；因为非利士人说，恐怕希伯来人制造刀枪。
{1Sa 13:20} But every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, or his sickle,
{1Sa 13:20} 以色列人要磨锄、犁、斧、铲，就下到非利士人那里去磨。
{1Sa 13:21} and the charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads.
{1Sa 13:21} 但有锉可以锉铲、犁、三齿叉、斧子，并赶牛锥。
{1Sa 13:22} So on the day of the battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.
{1Sa 13:22} 所以到了争战的日子，跟随扫罗和约拿单的人没有一个手里有刀有枪的，惟独扫罗和他儿子约拿单有。
{1Sa 13:23} And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
{1Sa 13:23} 非利士人的一队防兵到了密抹的隘口。
{1Sa 14:1}  One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor, "Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side." But he did not tell his father.
{1Sa 14:1}  有一日，扫罗的儿子约拿单对拿他兵器的少年人说：“我们不如过到那边，到非利士人的防营那里去。”但他没有告诉父亲。
{1Sa 14:2}  Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah in the pomegranate cave at Migron. The people who were with him were about six hundred men,
{1Sa 14:2}  扫罗在基比亚的尽边，坐在米矶仑的石榴树下，跟随他的约有六百人。
{1Sa 14:3}  including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.
{1Sa 14:3}  在那里有亚希突的儿子亚希亚，穿着以弗得。（亚希突是以迦博的哥哥，非尼哈的儿子，以利的孙子。以利从前在示罗作耶和华的祭司。）约拿单去了，百姓却不知道。
{1Sa 14:4}  Within the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
{1Sa 14:4}  约拿单要从隘口过到非利士防营那里去。这隘口两边各有一个山峰：一名播薛，一名西尼；
{1Sa 14:5}  The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.
{1Sa 14:5}  一峰向北，与密抹相对，一峰向南，与迦巴相对。
{1Sa 14:6}  Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, "Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the LORD will work for us, for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few."
{1Sa 14:6}  约拿单对拿兵器的少年人说：“我们不如过到未受割礼人的防营那里去，或者耶和华为我们施展能力；因为耶和华使人得胜，不在乎人多人少。”
{1Sa 14:7}  And his armor-bearer said to him, "Do all that is in your heart. Do as you wish. Behold, I am with you heart and soul."
{1Sa 14:7}  拿兵器的对他说：“随你的心意行吧。你可以上去，我必跟随你，与你同心。”
{1Sa 14:8}  Then Jonathan said, "Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them.
{1Sa 14:8}  约拿单说：“我们要过到那些人那里去，使他们看见我们。
{1Sa 14:9}  If they say to us, 'Wait until we come to you,' then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them.
{1Sa 14:9}  他们若对我们说：‘你们站住，等我们到你们那里去’，我们就站住，不上他们那里去。
{1Sa 14:10} But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us."
{1Sa 14:10} 他们若说：‘你们上到我们这里来’，这话就是我们的证据；我们便上去，因为耶和华将他们交在我们手里了。”
{1Sa 14:11} So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, "Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves."
{1Sa 14:11} 二人就使非利士的防兵看见。非利士人说：“希伯来人从所藏的洞穴里出来了！”
{1Sa 14:12} And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, "Come up to us, and we will show you a thing." And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel."
{1Sa 14:12} 防兵对约拿单和拿兵器的人说：“你们上到这里来，我们有一件事指示你们。”约拿单就对拿兵器的人说：“你跟随我上去，因为耶和华将他们交在以色列人手里了。”
{1Sa 14:13} Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him.
{1Sa 14:13} 约拿单就爬上去，拿兵器的人跟随他。约拿单杀倒非利士人，拿兵器的人也随着杀他们。
{1Sa 14:14} And that first strike, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, killed about twenty men within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.
{1Sa 14:14} 约拿单和拿兵器的人起头所杀的约有二十人，都在一亩地的半犁沟之内。
{1Sa 14:15} And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and even the raiders trembled, the earth quaked, and it became a very great panic.
{1Sa 14:15} 于是在营中、在田野、在众民内都有战兢，防兵和掠兵也都战兢，地也震动，战兢之势甚大。
{1Sa 14:16} And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude was dispersing here and there.
{1Sa 14:16} 在便雅悯的基比亚，扫罗的守望兵看见非利士的军众溃散，四围乱窜。
{1Sa 14:17} Then Saul said to the people who were with him, "Count and see who has gone from us." And when they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.
{1Sa 14:17} 扫罗就对跟随他的民说：“你们查点查点，看从我们这里出去的是谁？”他们一查点，就知道约拿单和拿兵器的人没有在这里。
{1Sa 14:18} So Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God here." For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel.
{1Sa 14:18} 那时神的约柜在以色列人那里。扫罗对亚希亚说：“你将神的约柜运了来。”
{1Sa 14:19} Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."
{1Sa 14:19} 扫罗正与祭司说话的时候，非利士营中的喧嚷越发大了；扫罗就对祭司说：“停手吧！”
{1Sa 14:20} Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle. And behold, every Philistine's sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion.
{1Sa 14:20} 扫罗和跟随他的人都聚集，来到战场，看见非利士人用刀互相击杀，大大惶乱。
{1Sa 14:21} Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
{1Sa 14:21} 从前由四方来跟随非利士军的希伯来人现在也转过来，帮助跟随扫罗和约拿单的以色列人了。
{1Sa 14:22} Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle.
{1Sa 14:22} 那藏在以法莲山地的以色列人听说非利士人逃跑，就出来紧紧地追杀他们。
{1Sa 14:23} So the LORD saved Israel that day. And the battle passed beyond Beth-aven.
{1Sa 14:23} 那日，耶和华使以色列人得胜，一直战到伯亚文。
{1Sa 14:24} And the men of Israel had been hard pressed that day, so Saul had laid an oath on the people, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies." So none of the people had tasted food.
{1Sa 14:24} 扫罗叫百姓起誓说，凡不等到晚上向敌人报完了仇吃什么的，必受咒诅。因此这日百姓没有吃什么，就极其困惫。
{1Sa 14:25} Now when all the people came to the forest, behold, there was honey on the ground.
{1Sa 14:25} 众民进入树林，见有蜜在地上。
{1Sa 14:26} And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
{1Sa 14:26} 他们进了树林，见有蜜流下来，却没有人敢用手取蜜入口，因为他们怕那誓言。
{1Sa 14:27} But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath, so he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright.
{1Sa 14:27} 约拿单没有听见他父亲叫百姓起誓，所以伸手中的杖，用杖头蘸在蜂房里，转手送入口内，眼睛就明亮了。
{1Sa 14:28} Then one of the people said, "Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food this day.'" And the people were faint.
{1Sa 14:28} 百姓中有一人对他说：“你父亲曾叫百姓严严地起誓说，今日吃什么的，必受咒诅；因此百姓就疲乏了。”
{1Sa 14:29} Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land. See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey.
{1Sa 14:29} 约拿单说：“我父亲连累你们了。你看，我尝了这一点蜜，眼睛就明亮了。
{1Sa 14:30} How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found. For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great."
{1Sa 14:30} 今日百姓若任意吃了从仇敌所夺的物，击杀的非利士人岂不更多吗？”
{1Sa 14:31} They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint.
{1Sa 14:31} 这日，以色列人击杀非利士人，从密抹直到亚雅仑。百姓甚是疲乏，
{1Sa 14:32} The people pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood.
{1Sa 14:32} 就急忙将所夺的牛羊和牛犊宰于地上，肉还带血就吃了。
{1Sa 14:33} Then they told Saul, "Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood." And he said, "You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here."
{1Sa 14:33} 有人告诉扫罗说：“百姓吃带血的肉，得罪耶和华了。”扫罗说：“你们有罪了，今日要将大石头滚到我这里来。”
{1Sa 14:34} And Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, 'Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat, and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.'" So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there.
{1Sa 14:34} 扫罗又说：“你们散在百姓中，对他们说，你们各人将牛羊牵到我这里来宰了吃，不可吃带血的肉得罪耶和华。”这夜，百姓就把牛羊牵到那里宰了。
{1Sa 14:35} And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.
{1Sa 14:35} 扫罗为耶和华筑了一座坛，这是他初次为耶和华筑的坛。
{1Sa 14:36} Then Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them." And they said, "Do whatever seems good to you." But the priest said, "Let us draw near to God here."
{1Sa 14:36} 扫罗说：“我们不如夜里下去追赶非利士人，抢掠他们，直到天亮，不留他们一人。”众民说：“你看怎样好就去行吧！”祭司说：“我们先当亲近神。”
{1Sa 14:37} And Saul inquired of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?" But he did not answer him that day.
{1Sa 14:37} 扫罗求问神说：“我下去追赶非利士人可以不可以？你将他们交在以色列人手里不交？”这日神没有回答他。
{1Sa 14:38} And Saul said, "Come here, all you leaders of the people, and know and see how this sin has arisen today.
{1Sa 14:38} 扫罗说：“你们百姓中的长老都上这里来，查明今日是谁犯了罪。
{1Sa 14:39} For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die." But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.
{1Sa 14:39} 我指着救以色列永生的耶和华起誓，就是我儿子约拿单犯了罪，他也必死。”但百姓中无一人回答他。
{1Sa 14:40} Then he said to all Israel, "You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side." And the people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."
{1Sa 14:40} 扫罗就对以色列众人说：“你们站在一边，我与我儿子约拿单也站在一边。”百姓对扫罗说：“你看怎样好就去行吧！”
{1Sa 14:41} Therefore Saul said, "O LORD God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim. But if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim." And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.
{1Sa 14:41} 扫罗祷告耶和华以色列的神说：“求你指示实情。”于是掣签掣出扫罗和约拿单来；百姓尽都无事。
{1Sa 14:42} Then Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan." And Jonathan was taken.
{1Sa 14:42} 扫罗说：“你们再掣签，看是我，是我儿子约拿单”，就掣出约拿单来。
{1Sa 14:43} Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." And Jonathan told him, "I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I will die."
{1Sa 14:43} 扫罗对约拿单说：“你告诉我，你做了什么事？”约拿单说：“我实在以手里的杖，用杖头蘸了一点蜜尝了一尝。这样我就死吗（或作：吧））？”
{1Sa 14:44} And Saul said, "God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan."
{1Sa 14:44} 扫罗说：“约拿单哪，你定要死！若不然，愿神重重的降罚与我。”
{1Sa 14:45} Then the people said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day." So the people ransomed Jonathan, so that he did not die.
{1Sa 14:45} 百姓对扫罗说：“约拿单在以色列人中这样大行拯救，岂可使他死呢？断乎不可！我们指着永生的耶和华起誓，连他的一根头发也不可落地，因为他今日与神一同做事。”于是百姓救约拿单免了死亡。
{1Sa 14:46} Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.
{1Sa 14:46} 扫罗回去，不追赶非利士人；非利士人也回本地去了。
{1Sa 14:47} When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned he routed them.
{1Sa 14:47} 扫罗执掌以色列的国权，常常攻击他四围的一切仇敌，就是摩押人、亚扪人、以东人，和琐巴诸王，并非利士人。他无论往何处去，都打败仇敌。
{1Sa 14:48} And he did valiantly and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.
{1Sa 14:48} 扫罗奋勇攻击亚玛力人，救了以色列人脱离抢掠他们之人的手。
{1Sa 14:49} Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.
{1Sa 14:49} 扫罗的儿子是约拿单、亦施韦、麦基舒亚。他的两个女儿：长女名米拉，次女名米甲。
{1Sa 14:50} And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
{1Sa 14:50} 扫罗的妻名叫亚希暖，是亚希玛斯的女儿。扫罗的元帅名叫押尼珥，是尼珥的儿子；尼珥是扫罗的叔叔。
{1Sa 14:51} Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
{1Sa 14:51} 扫罗的父亲基士，押尼珥的父亲尼珥，都是亚别的儿子。
{1Sa 14:52} There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself.
{1Sa 14:52} 扫罗平生常与非利士人大大争战。扫罗遇见有能力的人或勇士，都招募了来跟随他。
{1Sa 15:1}  And Samuel said to Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore listen to the words of the LORD.
{1Sa 15:1}  撒母耳对扫罗说：“耶和华差遣我膏你为王，治理他的百姓以色列；所以你当听从耶和华的话。
{1Sa 15:2}  Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I have noted what Amalek did to Israel in opposing them on the way when they came up out of Egypt.
{1Sa 15:2}  万军之耶和华如此说：‘以色列人出埃及的时候，在路上亚玛力人怎样待他们，怎样抵挡他们，我都没忘。
{1Sa 15:3}  Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'"
{1Sa 15:3}  现在你要去击打亚玛力人，灭尽他们所有的，不可怜惜他们，将男女、孩童、吃奶的，并牛、羊、骆驼，和驴尽行杀死。’”
{1Sa 15:4}  So Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah.
{1Sa 15:4}  于是扫罗招聚百姓在提拉因，数点他们，共有步兵二十万，另有犹大人一万。
{1Sa 15:5}  And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.
{1Sa 15:5}  扫罗到了亚玛力的京城，在谷中设下埋伏。
{1Sa 15:6}  Then Saul said to the Kenites, "Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
{1Sa 15:6}  扫罗对基尼人说：“你们离开亚玛力人下去吧，恐怕我将你们和亚玛力人一同杀灭；因为以色列人出埃及的时候，你们曾恩待他们。”于是基尼人离开亚玛力人去了。
{1Sa 15:7}  And Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.
{1Sa 15:7}  扫罗击打亚玛力人，从哈腓拉直到埃及前的书珥，
{1Sa 15:8}  And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive and devoted to destruction all the people with the edge of the sword.
{1Sa 15:8}  生擒了亚玛力王亚甲，用刀杀尽亚玛力的众民。
{1Sa 15:9}  But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction.
{1Sa 15:9}  扫罗和百姓却怜惜亚甲，也爱惜上好的牛、羊、牛犊、羊羔，并一切美物，不肯灭绝。凡下贱瘦弱的，尽都杀了。
{1Sa 15:10} The word of the LORD came to Samuel:
{1Sa 15:10} 耶和华的话临到撒母耳说：
{1Sa 15:11} "I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments." And Samuel was angry, and he cried to the LORD all night.
{1Sa 15:11} “我立扫罗为王，我后悔了；因为他转去不跟从我，不遵守我的命令。”撒母耳便甚忧愁，终夜哀求耶和华。
{1Sa 15:12} And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, "Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal."
{1Sa 15:12} 撒母耳清早起来，迎接扫罗。有人告诉撒母耳说：“扫罗到了迦密，在那里立了纪念碑，又转身下到吉甲。”
{1Sa 15:13} And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, "Blessed be you to the LORD. I have performed the commandment of the LORD."
{1Sa 15:13} 撒母耳到了扫罗那里，扫罗对他说：“愿耶和华赐福与你，耶和华的命令我已遵守了。”
{1Sa 15:14} And Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?"
{1Sa 15:14} 撒母耳说：“我耳中听见有羊叫、牛鸣，是从那里来的呢？”
{1Sa 15:15} Saul said, "They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God, and the rest we have devoted to destruction."
{1Sa 15:15} 扫罗说：“这是百姓从亚玛力人那里带来的；因为他们爱惜上好的牛羊，要献与耶和华你的神；其余的，我们都灭尽了。”
{1Sa 15:16} Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! I will tell you what the LORD said to me this night." And he said to him, "Speak."
{1Sa 15:16} 撒母耳对扫罗说：“你住口吧！等我将耶和华昨夜向我所说的话告诉你。”扫罗说：“请讲。”
{1Sa 15:17} And Samuel said, "Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.
{1Sa 15:17} 撒母耳对扫罗说：“从前你虽然以自己为小，岂不是被立为以色列支派的元首吗？耶和华膏你作以色列的王。
{1Sa 15:18} And the LORD sent you on a mission and said, 'Go, devote to destruction the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.'
{1Sa 15:18} 耶和华差遣你，吩咐你说，你去击打那些犯罪的亚玛力人，将他们灭绝净尽。
{1Sa 15:19} Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Why did you pounce on the spoil and do what was evil in the sight of the LORD?"
{1Sa 15:19} 你为何没有听从耶和华的命令，急忙掳掠财物，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事呢？”
{1Sa 15:20} And Saul said to Samuel, "I have obeyed the voice of the LORD. I have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me. I have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I have devoted the Amalekites to destruction.
{1Sa 15:20} 扫罗对撒母耳说：“我实在听从了耶和华的命令，行了耶和华所差遣我行的路，擒了亚玛力王亚甲来，灭尽了亚玛力人。
{1Sa 15:21} But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal."
{1Sa 15:21} 百姓却在所当灭的物中取了最好的牛羊，要在吉甲献与耶和华你的神。”
{1Sa 15:22} And Samuel said, "Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.
{1Sa 15:22} 撒母耳说：耶和华喜悦燔祭和平安祭，岂如喜悦人听从他的话呢？听命胜于献祭；顺从胜于公羊的脂油。
{1Sa 15:23} For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king."
{1Sa 15:23} 悖逆的罪与行邪术的罪相等；顽梗的罪与拜虚神和偶像的罪相同。你既厌弃耶和华的命令，耶和华也厌弃你作王。
{1Sa 15:24} Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.
{1Sa 15:24} 扫罗对撒母耳说：“我有罪了，我因惧怕百姓，听从他们的话，就违背了耶和华的命令和你的言语。
{1Sa 15:25} Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me that I may bow before the LORD."
{1Sa 15:25} 现在求你赦免我的罪，同我回去，我好敬拜耶和华。”
{1Sa 15:26} And Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you. For you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."
{1Sa 15:26} 撒母耳对扫罗说：“我不同你回去；因为你厌弃耶和华的命令，耶和华也厌弃你作以色列的王。”
{1Sa 15:27} As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, and it tore.
{1Sa 15:27} 撒母耳转身要走，扫罗就扯住他外袍的衣襟，衣襟就撕断了。
{1Sa 15:28} And Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.
{1Sa 15:28} 撒母耳对他说：“如此，今日耶和华使以色列国与你断绝，将这国赐与比你更好的人。
{1Sa 15:29} And also the Glory of Israel will not lie or have regret, for he is not a man, that he should have regret."
{1Sa 15:29} 以色列的大能者必不至说谎，也不至后悔；因为他迥非世人，决不后悔。”
{1Sa 15:30} Then he said, "I have sinned; yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may bow before the LORD your God."
{1Sa 15:30} 扫罗说：“我有罪了，虽然如此，求你在我百姓的长老和以色列人面前抬举我，同我回去，我好敬拜耶和华你的神。”
{1Sa 15:31} So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul bowed before the LORD.
{1Sa 15:31} 于是撒母耳转身跟随扫罗回去，扫罗就敬拜耶和华。
{1Sa 15:32} Then Samuel said, "Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites." And Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."
{1Sa 15:32} 撒母耳说：“要把亚玛力王亚甲带到我这里来。”亚甲就欢欢喜喜地来到他面前，心里说，死亡的苦难必定过去了。
{1Sa 15:33} And Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women." And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
{1Sa 15:33} 撒母耳说：“你既用刀使妇人丧子，这样，你母亲在妇人中也必丧子。”于是，撒母耳在吉甲耶和华面前将亚甲杀死。
{1Sa 15:34} Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.
{1Sa 15:34} 撒母耳回了拉玛。扫罗上他所住的基比亚，回自己的家去了。
{1Sa 15:35} And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.
{1Sa 15:35} 撒母耳直到死的日子，再没有见扫罗；但撒母耳为扫罗悲伤，是因耶和华后悔立他为以色列的王。
{1Sa 16:1}  The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons."
{1Sa 16:1}  耶和华对撒母耳说：“我既厌弃扫罗作以色列的王，你为他悲伤要到几时呢？你将膏油盛满了角，我差遣你往伯利恒人耶西那里去；因为我在他众子之内，预定一个作王的。”
{1Sa 16:2}  And Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me." And the LORD said, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'
{1Sa 16:2}  撒母耳说：“我怎能去呢？扫罗若听见，必要杀我。”耶和华说：“你可以带一只牛犊去，就说：‘我来是要向耶和华献祭。’
{1Sa 16:3}  And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. And you shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you."
{1Sa 16:3}  你要请耶西来吃祭肉，我就指示你所当行的事。我所指给你的人，你要膏他。”
{1Sa 16:4}  Samuel did what the LORD commanded and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling and said, "Do you come peaceably?"
{1Sa 16:4}  撒母耳就照耶和华的话去行。到了伯利恒，那城里的长老都战战兢兢地出来迎接他，问他说：“你是为平安来的吗？”
{1Sa 16:5}  And he said, "Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice." And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
{1Sa 16:5}  他说：“为平安来的，我是给耶和华献祭。你们当自洁，来与我同吃祭肉。”撒母耳就使耶西和他众子自洁，请他们来吃祭肉。
{1Sa 16:6}  When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD's anointed is before him."
{1Sa 16:6}  他们来的时候，撒母耳看见以利押，就心里说，耶和华的受膏者必定在他面前。
{1Sa 16:7}  But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart."
{1Sa 16:7}  耶和华却对撒母耳说：“不要看他的外貌和他身材高大，我不拣选他。因为，耶和华不像人看人：人是看外貌；耶和华是看内心。”
{1Sa 16:8}  Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
{1Sa 16:8}  耶西叫亚比拿达从撒母耳面前经过，撒母耳说：“耶和华也不拣选他。”
{1Sa 16:9}  Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
{1Sa 16:9}  耶西又叫沙玛从撒母耳面前经过，撒母耳说：“耶和华也不拣选他。”
{1Sa 16:10} And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen these."
{1Sa 16:10} 耶西叫他七个儿子都从撒母耳面前经过，撒母耳说：“这都不是耶和华所拣选的。”
{1Sa 16:11} Then Samuel said to Jesse, "Are all your sons here?" And he said, "There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep." And Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and get him, for we will not sit down till he comes here."
{1Sa 16:11} 撒母耳对耶西说：“你的儿子都在这里吗？”他回答说：“还有个小的，现在放羊。”撒母耳对耶西说：“你打发人去叫他来；他若不来，我们必不坐席。”
{1Sa 16:12} And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the LORD said, "Arise, anoint him, for this is he."
{1Sa 16:12} 耶西就打发人去叫了他来。他面色光红，双目清秀，容貌俊美。耶和华说：“这就是他，你起来膏他。”
{1Sa 16:13} Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.
{1Sa 16:13} 撒母耳就用角里的膏油，在他诸兄中膏了他。从这日起，耶和华的灵就大大感动大卫。撒母耳起身回拉玛去了。
{1Sa 16:14} Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and a harmful spirit from the LORD tormented him.
{1Sa 16:14} 耶和华的灵离开扫罗，有恶魔从耶和华那里来扰乱他。
{1Sa 16:15} And Saul's servants said to him, "Behold now, a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you.
{1Sa 16:15} 扫罗的臣仆对他说：“现在有恶魔从神那里来扰乱你。
{1Sa 16:16} Let our lord now command your servants who are before you to seek out a man who is skillful in playing the lyre, and when the harmful spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well."
{1Sa 16:16} 我们的主可以吩咐面前的臣仆，找一个善于弹琴的来，等神那里来的恶魔临到你身上的时候，使他用手弹琴，你就好了。”
{1Sa 16:17} So Saul said to his servants, "Provide for me a man who can play well and bring him to me."
{1Sa 16:17} 扫罗对臣仆说：“你们可以为我找一个善于弹琴的，带到我这里来。”
{1Sa 16:18} One of the young men answered, "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence, and the LORD is with him."
{1Sa 16:18} 其中有一个少年人说：“我曾见伯利恒人耶西的一个儿子善于弹琴，是大有勇敢的战士，说话合宜，容貌俊美，耶和华也与他同在。”
{1Sa 16:19} Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me David your son, who is with the sheep."
{1Sa 16:19} 于是扫罗差遣使者去见耶西，说：“请你打发你放羊的儿子大卫到我这里来。”
{1Sa 16:20} And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by David his son to Saul.
{1Sa 16:20} 耶西就把几个饼和一皮袋酒，并一只山羊羔，都驮在驴上，交给他儿子大卫，送与扫罗。
{1Sa 16:21} And David came to Saul and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.
{1Sa 16:21} 大卫到了扫罗那里，就侍立在扫罗面前。扫罗甚喜爱他，他就作了扫罗拿兵器的人。
{1Sa 16:22} And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, "Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight."
{1Sa 16:22} 扫罗差遣人去见耶西，说：“求你容大卫侍立在我面前，因为他在我眼前蒙了恩。”
{1Sa 16:23} And whenever the harmful spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the harmful spirit departed from him.
{1Sa 16:23} 从神那里来的恶魔临到扫罗身上的时候，大卫就拿琴，用手而弹，扫罗便舒畅爽快，恶魔离了他。
{1Sa 17:1}  Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle. And they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
{1Sa 17:1}  非利士人招聚他们的军旅，要来争战；聚集在属犹大的梭哥，安营在梭哥和亚西加中间的以弗大悯。
{1Sa 17:2}  And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines.
{1Sa 17:2}  扫罗和以色列人也聚集，在以拉谷安营，摆列队伍，要与非利士人打仗。
{1Sa 17:3}  And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.
{1Sa 17:3}  非利士人站在这边山上，以色列人站在那边山上，当中有谷。
{1Sa 17:4}  And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
{1Sa 17:4}  从非利士营中出来一个讨战的人，名叫歌利亚，是迦特人，身高六肘零一虎口；
{1Sa 17:5}  He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze.
{1Sa 17:5}  头戴铜盔，身穿铠甲，甲重五千舍客勒；
{1Sa 17:6}  And he had bronze armor on his legs, and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.
{1Sa 17:6}  腿上有铜护膝，两肩之中背负铜戟；
{1Sa 17:7}  The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And his shield-bearer went before him.
{1Sa 17:7}  枪杆粗如织布的机轴，铁枪头重六百舍客勒。有一个拿盾牌的人在他前面走。
{1Sa 17:8}  He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, "Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.
{1Sa 17:8}  歌利亚对着以色列的军队站立，呼叫说：“你们出来摆列队伍做什么呢？我不是非利士人吗？你们不是扫罗的仆人吗？可以从你们中间拣选一人，使他下到我这里来。
{1Sa 17:9}  If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us."
{1Sa 17:9}  他若能与我战斗，将我杀死，我们就作你们的仆人；我若胜了他，将他杀死，你们就作我们的仆人，服事我们。”
{1Sa 17:10} And the Philistine said, "I defy the ranks of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together."
{1Sa 17:10} 那非利士人又说：“我今日向以色列人的军队骂阵。你们叫一个人出来，与我战斗。”
{1Sa 17:11} When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
{1Sa 17:11} 扫罗和以色列众人听见非利士人的这些话，就惊惶，极其害怕。
{1Sa 17:12} Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years.
{1Sa 17:12} 大卫是犹大、伯利恒的以法他人耶西的儿子。耶西有八个儿子。当扫罗的时候，耶西已经老迈。
{1Sa 17:13} The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
{1Sa 17:13} 耶西的三个大儿子跟随扫罗出征。这出征的三个儿子：长子名叫以利押，次子名叫亚比拿达，三子名叫沙玛。
{1Sa 17:14} David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul,
{1Sa 17:14} 大卫是最小的；那三个大儿子跟随扫罗。
{1Sa 17:15} but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
{1Sa 17:15} 大卫有时离开扫罗，回伯利恒放他父亲的羊。
{1Sa 17:16} For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.
{1Sa 17:16} 那非利士人早晚都出来站着，如此四十日。
{1Sa 17:17} And Jesse said to David his son, "Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.
{1Sa 17:17} 一日，耶西对他儿子大卫说：“你拿一伊法烘了的穗子和十个饼，速速地送到营里去，交给你哥哥们；
{1Sa 17:18} Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See if your brothers are well, and bring some token from them."
{1Sa 17:18} 再拿这十块奶饼，送给他们的千夫长，且问你哥哥们好，向他们要一封信来。”
{1Sa 17:19} Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
{1Sa 17:19} 扫罗与大卫的三个哥哥和以色列众人，在以拉谷与非利士人打仗。
{1Sa 17:20} And David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the encampment as the host was going out to the battle line, shouting the war cry.
{1Sa 17:20} 大卫早晨起来，将羊交托一个看守的人，照着他父亲所吩咐的话，带着食物去了。到了辎重营，军兵刚出到战场，呐喊要战。
{1Sa 17:21} And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army.
{1Sa 17:21} 以色列人和非利士人都摆列队伍，彼此相对。
{1Sa 17:22} And David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the ranks and went and greeted his brothers.
{1Sa 17:22} 大卫把他带来的食物留在看守物件人的手下，跑到战场，问他哥哥们安。
{1Sa 17:23} As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.
{1Sa 17:23} 与他们说话的时候，那讨战的，就是属迦特的非利士人歌利亚，从非利士队中出来，说从前所说的话；大卫都听见了。
{1Sa 17:24} All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were much afraid.
{1Sa 17:24} 以色列众人看见那人，就逃跑，极其害怕。
{1Sa 17:25} And the men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in Israel."
{1Sa 17:25} 以色列人彼此说：“这上来的人你看见了吗？他上来是要向以色列人骂阵。若有能杀他的，王必赏赐他大财，将自己的女儿给他为妻，并在以色列人中免他父家纳粮当差。”
{1Sa 17:26} And David said to the men who stood by him, "What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
{1Sa 17:26} 大卫问站在旁边的人说：“有人杀这非利士人，除掉以色列人的耻辱，怎样待他呢？这未受割礼的非利士人是谁呢？竟敢向永生神的军队骂阵吗？”
{1Sa 17:27} And the people answered him in the same way, "So shall it be done to the man who kills him."
{1Sa 17:27} 百姓照先前的话回答他说：“有人能杀这非利士人，必如此如此待他。”
{1Sa 17:28} Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. And Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, "Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle."
{1Sa 17:28} 大卫的长兄以利押听见大卫与他们所说的话，就向他发怒，说：“你下来做什么呢？在旷野的那几只羊，你交托了谁呢？我知道你的骄傲和你心里的恶意，你下来特为要看争战！”
{1Sa 17:29} And David said, "What have I done now? Was it not but a word?"
{1Sa 17:29} 大卫说：“我做了什么呢？我来岂没有缘故吗？”
{1Sa 17:30} And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way, and the people answered him again as before.
{1Sa 17:30} 大卫就离开他转向别人，照先前的话而问；百姓仍照先前的话回答他。
{1Sa 17:31} When the words that David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul, and he sent for him.
{1Sa 17:31} 有人听见大卫所说的话，就告诉了扫罗；扫罗便打发人叫他来。
{1Sa 17:32} And David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
{1Sa 17:32} 大卫对扫罗说：“人都不必因那非利士人胆怯。你的仆人要去与那非利士人战斗。”
{1Sa 17:33} And Saul said to David, "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth."
{1Sa 17:33} 扫罗对大卫说：“你不能去与那非利士人战斗；因为你年纪太轻，他自幼就作战士。”
{1Sa 17:34} But David said to Saul, "Your servant used to keep sheep for his father. And when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock,
{1Sa 17:34} 大卫对扫罗说：“你仆人为父亲放羊，有时来了狮子，有时来了熊，从群中衔一只羊羔去。
{1Sa 17:35} I went after him and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth. And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him.
{1Sa 17:35} 我就追赶他，击打他，将羊羔从他口中救出来。他起来要害我，我就揪着他的胡子，将他打死。
{1Sa 17:36} Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God."
{1Sa 17:36} 你仆人曾打死狮子和熊，这未受割礼的非利士人向永生神的军队骂阵，也必像狮子和熊一般。”
{1Sa 17:37} And David said, "The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." And Saul said to David, "Go, and the LORD be with you!"
{1Sa 17:37} 大卫又说：“耶和华救我脱离狮子和熊的爪，也必救我脱离这非利士人的手。”扫罗对大卫说：“你可以去吧！耶和华必与你同在。”
{1Sa 17:38} Then Saul clothed David with his armor. He put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail,
{1Sa 17:38} 扫罗就把自己的战衣给大卫穿上，将铜盔给他戴上，又给他穿上铠甲。
{1Sa 17:39} and David strapped his sword over his armor. And he tried in vain to go, for he had not tested them. Then David said to Saul, "I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them." So David put them off.
{1Sa 17:39} 大卫把刀跨在战衣外，试试能走不能走；因为素来没有穿惯，就对扫罗说：“我穿戴这些不能走，因为素来没有穿惯。”于是摘脱了。
{1Sa 17:40} Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in his shepherd's pouch. His sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.
{1Sa 17:40} 他手中拿杖，又在溪中挑选了五块光滑石子，放在袋里，就是牧人带的囊里；手中拿着甩石的机弦，就去迎那非利士人。
{1Sa 17:41} And the Philistine moved forward and came near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him.
{1Sa 17:41} 非利士人也渐渐地迎着大卫来，拿盾牌的走在前头。
{1Sa 17:42} And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance.
{1Sa 17:42} 非利士人观看，见了大卫，就藐视他；因为他年轻，面色光红，容貌俊美。
{1Sa 17:43} And the Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
{1Sa 17:43} 非利士人对大卫说：“你拿杖到我这里来，我岂是狗呢？”非利士人就指着自己的神咒诅大卫。
{1Sa 17:44} The Philistine said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field."
{1Sa 17:44} 非利士人又对大卫说：“来吧！我将你的肉给空中的飞鸟、田野的走兽吃。”
{1Sa 17:45} Then David said to the Philistine, "You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
{1Sa 17:45} 大卫对非利士人说：“你来攻击我，是靠着刀枪和铜戟；我来攻击你，是靠着万军之耶和华的名，就是你所怒骂带领以色列军队的神。
{1Sa 17:46} This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
{1Sa 17:46} 今日耶和华必将你交在我手里。我必杀你，斩你的头，又将非利士军兵的尸首给空中的飞鸟、地上的野兽吃，使普天下的人都知道以色列中有神；
{1Sa 17:47} and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hand."
{1Sa 17:47} 又使这众人知道耶和华使人得胜，不是用刀用枪，因为争战的胜败全在乎耶和华。他必将你们交在我们手里。”
{1Sa 17:48} When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.
{1Sa 17:48} 非利士人起身，迎着大卫前来。大卫急忙迎着非利士人，往战场跑去。
{1Sa 17:49} And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.
{1Sa 17:49} 大卫用手从囊中掏出一块石子来，用机弦甩去，打中非利士人的额，石子进入额内，他就仆倒，面伏于地。
{1Sa 17:50} So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in the hand of David.
{1Sa 17:50} 这样，大卫用机弦甩石，胜了那非利士人，打死他；大卫手中却没有刀。
{1Sa 17:51} Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
{1Sa 17:51} 大卫跑去，站在非利士人身旁，将他的刀从鞘中拔出来，杀死他，割了他的头。非利士众人看见他们讨战的勇士死了，就都逃跑。
{1Sa 17:52} And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron.
{1Sa 17:52} 以色列人和犹大人便起身呐喊，追赶非利士人，直到迦特（或作：该）和以革伦的城门。被杀的非利士人倒在沙拉音的路上，直到迦特和以革伦。
{1Sa 17:53} And the people of Israel came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
{1Sa 17:53} 以色列人追赶非利士人回来，就夺了他们的营盘。
{1Sa 17:54} And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.
{1Sa 17:54} 大卫将那非利士人的头拿到耶路撒冷，却将他军装放在自己的帐棚里。
{1Sa 17:55} As soon as Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is this youth?" And Abner said, "As your soul lives, O king, I do not know."
{1Sa 17:55} 扫罗看见大卫去攻击非利士人，就问元帅押尼珥说：“押尼珥啊，那少年人是谁的儿子？”押尼珥说：“我敢在王面前起誓，我不知道。”
{1Sa 17:56} And the king said, "Inquire whose son the boy is."
{1Sa 17:56} 王说：“你可以问问那幼年人是谁的儿子。”
{1Sa 17:57} And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
{1Sa 17:57} 大卫打死非利士人回来，押尼珥领他到扫罗面前，他手中拿着非利士人的头。
{1Sa 17:58} And Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" And David answered, "I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
{1Sa 17:58} 扫罗问他说：“少年人哪，你是谁的儿子？”大卫说：“我是你仆人伯利恒人耶西的儿子。”
{1Sa 18:1}  As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
{1Sa 18:1}  大卫对扫罗说完了话，约拿单的心与大卫的心深相契合。约拿单爱大卫，如同爱自己的性命。
{1Sa 18:2}  And Saul took him that day and would not let him return to his father's house.
{1Sa 18:2}  那日扫罗留住大卫，不容他再回父家。
{1Sa 18:3}  Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul.
{1Sa 18:3}  约拿单爱大卫如同爱自己的性命，就与他结盟。
{1Sa 18:4}  And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his belt.
{1Sa 18:4}  约拿单从身上脱下外袍，给了大卫，又将战衣、刀、弓、腰带都给了他。
{1Sa 18:5}  And David went out and was successful wherever Saul sent him, so that Saul set him over the men of war. And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
{1Sa 18:5}  扫罗无论差遣大卫往何处去，他都做事精明。扫罗就立他作战士长，众百姓和扫罗的臣仆无不喜悦。
{1Sa 18:6}  As they were coming home, when David returned from striking down the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy, and with musical instruments.
{1Sa 18:6}  大卫打死了那非利士人，同众人回来的时候，妇女们从以色列各城里出来，欢欢喜喜，打鼓击磬，歌唱跳舞，迎接扫罗王。
{1Sa 18:7}  And the women sang to one another as they celebrated, "Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands."
{1Sa 18:7}  众妇女舞蹈唱和，说：“扫罗杀死千千，大卫杀死万万。”
{1Sa 18:8}  And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands, and what more can he have but the kingdom?"
{1Sa 18:8}  扫罗甚发怒，不喜悦这话，就说：“将万万归大卫，千千归我，只剩下王位没有给他了。”
{1Sa 18:9}  And Saul eyed David from that day on.
{1Sa 18:9}  从这日起，扫罗就怒视大卫。
{1Sa 18:10} The next day a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand.
{1Sa 18:10} 次日，从神那里来的恶魔大大降在扫罗身上，他就在家中胡言乱语。大卫照常弹琴，扫罗手里拿着枪。
{1Sa 18:11} And Saul hurled the spear, for he thought, "I will pin David to the wall." But David evaded him twice.
{1Sa 18:11} 扫罗把枪一抡，心里说，我要将大卫刺透，钉在墙上。大卫躲避他两次。
{1Sa 18:12} Saul was afraid of David because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.
{1Sa 18:12} 扫罗惧怕大卫；因为耶和华离开自己，与大卫同在。
{1Sa 18:13} So Saul removed him from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand. And he went out and came in before the people.
{1Sa 18:13} 所以扫罗使大卫离开自己，立他为千夫长，他就领兵出入。
{1Sa 18:14} And David had success in all his undertakings, for the LORD was with him.
{1Sa 18:14} 大卫做事无不精明，耶和华也与他同在。
{1Sa 18:15} And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in fearful awe of him.
{1Sa 18:15} 扫罗见大卫做事精明，就甚怕他。
{1Sa 18:16} But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.
{1Sa 18:16} 但以色列和犹大众人都爱大卫，因为他领他们出入。
{1Sa 18:17} Then Saul said to David, "Here is my elder daughter Merab. I will give her to you for a wife. Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD's battles." For Saul thought, "Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him."
{1Sa 18:17} 扫罗对大卫说：“我将大女儿米拉给你为妻，只要你为我奋勇，为耶和华争战。”扫罗心里说：“我不好亲手害他，要藉非利士人的手害他。”
{1Sa 18:18} And David said to Saul, "Who am I, and who are my relatives, my father's clan in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"
{1Sa 18:18} 大卫对扫罗说：“我是谁，我是什么出身，我父家在以色列中是何等的家，岂敢作王的女婿呢？”
{1Sa 18:19} But at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.
{1Sa 18:19} 扫罗的女儿米拉到了当给大卫的时候，扫罗却给了米何拉人亚得列为妻。
{1Sa 18:20} Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
{1Sa 18:20} 扫罗的次女米甲爱大卫。有人告诉扫罗，扫罗就喜悦。
{1Sa 18:21} Saul thought, "Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." Therefore Saul said to David a second time, "You shall now be my son-in-law."
{1Sa 18:21} 扫罗心里说：“我将这女儿给大卫，作他的网罗，好藉非利士人的手害他。”所以扫罗对大卫说：“你今日可以第二次作我的女婿。”
{1Sa 18:22} And Saul commanded his servants, "Speak to David in private and say, 'Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now then become the king's son-in-law.'"
{1Sa 18:22} 扫罗吩咐臣仆说：“你们暗中对大卫说：‘王喜悦你，王的臣仆也都喜爱你，所以你当作王的女婿。’”
{1Sa 18:23} And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, "Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man and have no reputation?"
{1Sa 18:23} 扫罗的臣仆就照这话说给大卫听。大卫说：“你们以为作王的女婿是一件小事吗？我是贫穷卑微的人。”
{1Sa 18:24} And the servants of Saul told him, "Thus and so did David speak."
{1Sa 18:24} 扫罗的臣仆回奏说，大卫所说的如此如此。
{1Sa 18:25} Then Saul said, "Thus shall you say to David, 'The king desires no bride-price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged of the king's enemies.'" Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
{1Sa 18:25} 扫罗说：“你们要对大卫这样说：‘王不要什么聘礼，只要一百非利士人的阳皮，好在王的仇敌身上报仇。’”扫罗的意思要使大卫丧在非利士人的手里。
{1Sa 18:26} And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. Before the time had expired,
{1Sa 18:26} 扫罗的臣仆将这话告诉大卫，大卫就欢喜作王的女婿。日期还没有到，
{1Sa 18:27} David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife.
{1Sa 18:27} 大卫和跟随他的人起身前往，杀了二百非利士人，将阳皮满数交给王，为要作王的女婿。于是扫罗将女儿米甲给大卫为妻。
{1Sa 18:28} But when Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him,
{1Sa 18:28} 扫罗见耶和华与大卫同在，又知道女儿米甲爱大卫，
{1Sa 18:29} Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was David's enemy continually.
{1Sa 18:29} 就更怕大卫，常作大卫的仇敌。
{1Sa 18:30} Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.
{1Sa 18:30} 每逢非利士军长出来打仗，大卫比扫罗的臣仆做事精明，因此他的名被人尊重。
{1Sa 19:1}  And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.
{1Sa 19:1}  扫罗对他儿子约拿单和众臣仆说，要杀大卫；扫罗的儿子约拿单却甚喜爱大卫。
{1Sa 19:2}  And Jonathan told David, "Saul my father seeks to kill you. Therefore be on your guard in the morning. Stay in a secret place and hide yourself.
{1Sa 19:2}  约拿单告诉大卫说：“我父扫罗想要杀你，所以明日早晨你要小心，到一个僻静地方藏身。
{1Sa 19:3}  And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you. And if I learn anything I will tell you."
{1Sa 19:3}  我就出到你所藏的田里，站在我父亲旁边与他谈论。我看他情形怎样，我必告诉你。”
{1Sa 19:4}  And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have brought good to you.
{1Sa 19:4}  约拿单向他父亲扫罗替大卫说好话，说：“王不可得罪王的仆人大卫；因为他未曾得罪你，他所行的都与你大有益处。
{1Sa 19:5}  For he took his life in his hand and he struck down the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?"
{1Sa 19:5}  他拚命杀那非利士人，耶和华为以色列众人大行拯救；那时你看见，甚是欢喜，现在为何无故要杀大卫，流无辜人的血，自己取罪呢？”
{1Sa 19:6}  And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan. Saul swore, "As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death."
{1Sa 19:6}  扫罗听了约拿单的话，就指着永生的耶和华起誓说：“我必不杀他。”
{1Sa 19:7}  And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan reported to him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.
{1Sa 19:7}  约拿单叫大卫来，把这一切事告诉他，带他去见扫罗。他就仍然侍立在扫罗面前。
{1Sa 19:8}  And there was war again. And David went out and fought with the Philistines and struck them with a great blow, so that they fled before him.
{1Sa 19:8}  此后又有争战的事。大卫出去与非利士人打仗，大大杀败他们，他们就在他面前逃跑。
{1Sa 19:9}  Then a harmful spirit from the LORD came upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing the lyre.
{1Sa 19:9}  从耶和华那里来的恶魔又降在扫罗身上（扫罗手里拿枪坐在屋里），大卫就用手弹琴。
{1Sa 19:10} And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.
{1Sa 19:10} 扫罗用枪想要刺透大卫，钉在墙上；他却躲开，扫罗的枪刺入墙内。当夜大卫逃走，躲避了。
{1Sa 19:11} Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, "If you do not escape with your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed."
{1Sa 19:11} 扫罗打发人到大卫的房屋那里窥探他，要等到天亮杀他。大卫的妻米甲对他说：“你今夜若不逃命，明日你要被杀。”
{1Sa 19:12} So Michal let David down through the window, and he fled away and escaped.
{1Sa 19:12} 于是米甲将大卫从窗户里缒下去；大卫就逃走，躲避了。
{1Sa 19:13} Michal took an image and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of goats' hair at its head and covered it with the clothes.
{1Sa 19:13} 米甲把家中的神像放在床上，头枕在山羊毛装的枕头上，用被遮盖。
{1Sa 19:14} And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, "He is sick."
{1Sa 19:14} 扫罗打发人去捉拿大卫，米甲说：“他病了。”
{1Sa 19:15} Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him."
{1Sa 19:15} 扫罗又打发人去看大卫，说：“当连床将他抬来，我好杀他。”
{1Sa 19:16} And when the messengers came in, behold, the image was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at its head.
{1Sa 19:16} 使者进去，看见床上有神像，头枕在山羊毛装的枕头上。
{1Sa 19:17} Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me thus and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?" And Michal answered Saul, "He said to me, 'Let me go. Why should I kill you?'"
{1Sa 19:17} 扫罗对米甲说：“你为什么这样欺哄我，放我仇敌逃走呢？”米甲回答说：“他对我说：‘你放我走，不然我要杀你。’”
{1Sa 19:18} Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and lived at Naioth.
{1Sa 19:18} 大卫逃避，来到拉玛见撒母耳，将扫罗向他所行的事述说了一遍。他和撒母耳就往拿约去居住。
{1Sa 19:19} And it was told Saul, "Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."
{1Sa 19:19} 有人告诉扫罗，说大卫在拉玛的拿约。
{1Sa 19:20} Then Saul sent messengers to take David, and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
{1Sa 19:20} 扫罗打发人去捉拿大卫。去的人见有一班先知都受感说话，撒母耳站在其中监管他们；打发去的人也受神的灵感动说话。
{1Sa 19:21} When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
{1Sa 19:21} 有人将这事告诉扫罗，他又打发人去，他们也受感说话。扫罗第三次打发人去，他们也受感说话。
{1Sa 19:22} Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great well that is in Secu. And he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" And one said, "Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah."
{1Sa 19:22} 然后扫罗自己往拉玛去，到了西沽的大井，问人说：“撒母耳和大卫在那里呢？”有人说：“在拉玛的拿约。”
{1Sa 19:23} And he went there to Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
{1Sa 19:23} 他就往拉玛的拿约去。神的灵也感动他，一面走一面说话，直到拉玛的拿约。
{1Sa 19:24} And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night. Thus it is said, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
{1Sa 19:24} 他就脱了衣服，在撒母耳面前受感说话，一昼一夜露体躺卧。因此有句俗语说：“扫罗也列在先知中吗？”
{1Sa 20:1}  Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"
{1Sa 20:1}  大卫从拉玛的拿约逃跑，来到约拿单那里，对他说：“我做了什么？有什么罪孽呢？在你父亲面前犯了什么罪，他竟寻索我的性命呢？”
{1Sa 20:2}  And he said to him, "Far from it! You shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. And why should my father hide this from me? It is not so."
{1Sa 20:2}  约拿单回答说：“断然不是！你必不至死。我父做事，无论大小，没有不叫我知道的。怎么独有这事隐瞒我呢？决不如此。”
{1Sa 20:3}  But David vowed again, saying, "Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he thinks, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.' But truly, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death."
{1Sa 20:3}  大卫又起誓说：“你父亲准知我在你眼前蒙恩。他心里说，不如不叫约拿单知道，恐怕他愁烦。我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我离死不过一步。”
{1Sa 20:4}  Then Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you say, I will do for you."
{1Sa 20:4}  约拿单对大卫说：“你心里所求的，我必为你成就。”
{1Sa 20:5}  David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening.
{1Sa 20:5}  大卫对约拿单说：“明日是初一，我当与王同席，求你容我去藏在田野，直到第三日晚上。
{1Sa 20:6}  If your father misses me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city, for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the clan.'
{1Sa 20:6}  你父亲若见我不在席上，你就说：‘大卫切求我许他回本城伯利恒去，因为他全家在那里献年祭。’
{1Sa 20:7}  If he says, 'Good!' it will be well with your servant, but if he is angry, then know that harm is determined by him.
{1Sa 20:7}  你父亲若说好，仆人就平安了；他若发怒，你就知道他决意要害我。
{1Sa 20:8}  Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?"
{1Sa 20:8}  求你施恩与仆人，因你在耶和华面前曾与仆人结盟。我若有罪，不如你自己杀我，何必将我交给你父亲呢？”
{1Sa 20:9}  And Jonathan said, "Far be it from you! If I knew that it was determined by my father that harm should come to you, would I not tell you?"
{1Sa 20:9}  约拿单说：“断无此事！我若知道我父亲决意害你，我岂不告诉你呢？”
{1Sa 20:10} Then David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?"
{1Sa 20:10} 大卫对约拿单说：“你父亲若用厉言回答你，谁来告诉我呢？”
{1Sa 20:11} And Jonathan said to David, "Come, let us go out into the field." So they both went out into the field.
{1Sa 20:11} 约拿单对大卫说：“你我且往田野去。”二人就往田野去了。
{1Sa 20:12} And Jonathan said to David, "The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness! When I have sounded out my father, about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you?
{1Sa 20:12} 约拿单对大卫说：“愿耶和华以色列的神为证。明日约在这时候，或第三日，我探我父亲的意思，若向你有好意，我岂不打发人告诉你吗？
{1Sa 20:13} But should it please my father to do you harm, the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also if I do not disclose it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. May the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.
{1Sa 20:13} 我父亲若有意害你，我不告诉你使你平平安安的走，愿耶和华重重的降罚与我。愿耶和华与你同在，如同从前与我父亲同在一样。
{1Sa 20:14} If I am still alive, show me the steadfast love of the LORD, that I may not die;
{1Sa 20:14} 你要照耶和华的慈爱恩待我，不但我活着的时候免我死亡，
{1Sa 20:15} and do not cut off your steadfast love from my house forever, when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth."
{1Sa 20:15} 就是我死后，耶和华从地上剪除你仇敌的时候，你也永不可向我家绝了恩惠。”
{1Sa 20:16} And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD take vengeance on David's enemies."
{1Sa 20:16} 于是约拿单与大卫家结盟，说：“愿耶和华藉大卫的仇敌追讨背约的罪。”
{1Sa 20:17} And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
{1Sa 20:17} 约拿单因爱大卫如同爱自己的性命，就使他再起誓。
{1Sa 20:18} Then Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
{1Sa 20:18} 约拿单对他说：“明日是初一，你的座位空设，人必理会你不在那里。
{1Sa 20:19} On the third day go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand, and remain beside the stone heap.
{1Sa 20:19} 你等三日，就要速速下去，到你从前遇事所藏的地方，在以色磐石那里等候。
{1Sa 20:20} And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.
{1Sa 20:20} 我要向磐石旁边射三箭，如同射箭靶一样。
{1Sa 20:21} And behold, I will send the boy, saying, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them,' then you are to come, for, as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger.
{1Sa 20:21} 我要打发童子，说：‘去把箭找来。’我若对童子说：‘箭在后头，把箭拿来’，你就可以回来；我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你必平安无事。
{1Sa 20:22} But if I say to the youth, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then go, for the LORD has sent you away.
{1Sa 20:22} 我若对童子说：‘箭在前头’，你就要去，因为是耶和华打发你去的。
{1Sa 20:23} And as for the matter of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever."
{1Sa 20:23} 至于你我今日所说的话，有耶和华在你我中间为证，直到永远。”
{1Sa 20:24} So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.
{1Sa 20:24} 大卫就去藏在田野。到了初一日，王坐席要吃饭。
{1Sa 20:25} The king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner sat by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.
{1Sa 20:25} 王照常坐在靠墙的位上，约拿单侍立，押尼珥坐在扫罗旁边，大卫的座位空设。
{1Sa 20:26} Yet Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, "Something has happened to him. He is not clean; surely he is not clean."
{1Sa 20:26} 然而这日扫罗没有说什么，他想大卫遇事，偶染不洁，他必定是不洁。
{1Sa 20:27} But on the second day, the day after the new moon, David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, "Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"
{1Sa 20:27} 初二日大卫的座位还空设。扫罗问他儿子约拿单说：“耶西的儿子为何昨日、今日没有来吃饭呢？”
{1Sa 20:28} Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.
{1Sa 20:28} 约拿单回答扫罗说：“大卫切求我容他往伯利恒去。
{1Sa 20:29} He said, 'Let me go, for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away and see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table."
{1Sa 20:29} 他说：‘求你容我去，因为我家在城里有献祭的事；我长兄吩咐我去。如今我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你容我去见我的弟兄’；所以大卫没有赴王的席。”
{1Sa 20:30} Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, "You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?
{1Sa 20:30} 扫罗向约拿单发怒，对他说：“你这顽梗背逆之妇人所生的，我岂不知道你喜悦耶西的儿子，自取羞辱，以致你母亲露体蒙羞吗？
{1Sa 20:31} For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Therefore send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die."
{1Sa 20:31} 耶西的儿子若在世间活着，你和你的国位必站立不住。现在你要打发人去，将他捉拿交给我；他是该死的。”
{1Sa 20:32} Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"
{1Sa 20:32} 约拿单对父亲扫罗说：“他为什么该死呢？他做了什么呢？”
{1Sa 20:33} But Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.
{1Sa 20:33} 扫罗向约拿单抡枪要刺他，约拿单就知道他父亲决意要杀大卫。
{1Sa 20:34} And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.
{1Sa 20:34} 于是约拿单气忿忿地从席上起来，在这初二日没有吃饭。他因见父亲羞辱大卫，就为大卫愁烦。
{1Sa 20:35} In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and with him a little boy.
{1Sa 20:35} 次日早晨，约拿单按着与大卫约会的时候出到田野，有一个童子跟随。
{1Sa 20:36} And he said to his boy, "Run and find the arrows that I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
{1Sa 20:36} 约拿单对童子说：“你跑去，把我所射的箭找来。”童子跑去，约拿单就把箭射在童子前头。
{1Sa 20:37} And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, "Is not the arrow beyond you?"
{1Sa 20:37} 童子到了约拿单落箭之地，约拿单呼叫童子说：“箭不是在你前头吗？”
{1Sa 20:38} And Jonathan called after the boy, "Hurry! Be quick! Do not stay!" So Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master.
{1Sa 20:38} 约拿单又呼叫童子说：“速速地去，不要迟延！”童子就拾起箭来，回到主人那里。
{1Sa 20:39} But the boy knew nothing. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
{1Sa 20:39} 童子却不知道这是什么意思，只有约拿单和大卫知道。
{1Sa 20:40} And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, "Go and carry them to the city."
{1Sa 20:40} 约拿单将弓箭交给童子，吩咐说：“你拿到城里去。”
{1Sa 20:41} And as soon as the boy had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap and fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed one another and wept with one another, David weeping the most.
{1Sa 20:41} 童子一去，大卫就从磐石的南边出来，俯伏在地，拜了三拜；二人亲嘴，彼此哭泣，大卫哭得更恸。
{1Sa 20:42} Then Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD shall be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.'" And he rose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.
{1Sa 20:42} 约拿单对大卫说：“我们二人曾指着耶和华的名起誓说：‘愿耶和华在你我中间，并你我后裔中间为证，直到永远。’如今你平平安安的去吧！”大卫就起身走了；约拿单也回城里去了。
{1Sa 21:1}  Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came to meet David trembling and said to him, "Why are you alone, and no one with you?"
{1Sa 21:1}  大卫到了挪伯祭司亚希米勒那里，亚希米勒战战兢兢地出来迎接他，问他说：“你为什么独自来，没有人跟随呢？”
{1Sa 21:2}  And David said to Ahimelech the priest, "The king has charged me with a matter and said to me, 'Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.' I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place.
{1Sa 21:2}  大卫回答祭司亚希米勒说：“王吩咐我一件事说：‘我差遣你委托你的这件事，不要使人知道。’故此我已派定少年人在某处等候我。
{1Sa 21:3}  Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here."
{1Sa 21:3}  现在你手下有什么？求你给我五个饼或是别样的食物。”
{1Sa 21:4}  And the priest answered David, "I have no common bread on hand, but there is holy bread--if the young men have kept themselves from women."
{1Sa 21:4}  祭司对大卫说：“我手下没有寻常的饼，只有圣饼；若少年人没有亲近妇人才可以给。”
{1Sa 21:5}  And David answered the priest, "Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition. The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey. How much more today will their vessels be holy?"
{1Sa 21:5}  大卫对祭司说：“实在约有三日我们没有亲近妇人；我出来的时候，虽是寻常行路，少年人的器皿还是洁净的；何况今日不更是洁净吗？”
{1Sa 21:6}  So the priest gave him the holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the LORD, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.
{1Sa 21:6}  祭司就拿圣饼给他；因为在那里没有别样饼，只有更换新饼，从耶和华面前撤下来的陈设饼。
{1Sa 21:7}  Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD. His name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen.
{1Sa 21:7}  （当日有扫罗的一个臣子留在耶和华面前。他名叫多益，是以东人，作扫罗的司牧长。）
{1Sa 21:8}  Then David said to Ahimelech, "Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."
{1Sa 21:8}  大卫问亚希米勒说：“你手下有枪有刀没有？因为王的事甚急，连刀剑器械我都没有带。”
{1Sa 21:9}  And the priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here." And David said, "There is none like that; give it to me."
{1Sa 21:9}  祭司说：“你在以拉谷杀非利士人歌利亚的那刀在这里，裹在布中，放在以弗得后边，你要就可以拿去；除此以外，再没有别的。”大卫说：“这刀没有可比的！求你给我。”
{1Sa 21:10} And David rose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish the king of Gath.
{1Sa 21:10} 那日大卫起来，躲避扫罗，逃到迦特王亚吉那里。
{1Sa 21:11} And the servants of Achish said to him, "Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances, 'Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
{1Sa 21:11} 亚吉的臣仆对亚吉说：“这不是以色列国王大卫吗？那里的妇女跳舞唱和，不是指着他说‘扫罗杀死千千，大卫杀死万万’吗？”
{1Sa 21:12} And David took these words to heart and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
{1Sa 21:12} 大卫将这话放在心里，甚惧怕迦特王亚吉，
{1Sa 21:13} So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands and made marks on the doors of the gate and let his spittle run down his beard.
{1Sa 21:13} 就在众人面前改变了寻常的举动，在他们手下假装疯癫，在城门的门扇上胡写乱画，使唾沫流在胡子上。
{1Sa 21:14} Then Achish said to his servants, "Behold, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?
{1Sa 21:14} 亚吉对臣仆说：“你们看，这人是疯子。为什么带他到我这里来呢？
{1Sa 21:15} Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?"
{1Sa 21:15} 我岂缺少疯子，你们带这人来在我面前疯癫吗？这人岂可进我的家呢？”
{1Sa 22:1}  David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.
{1Sa 22:1}  大卫就离开那里，逃到亚杜兰洞。他的弟兄和他父亲的全家听见了，就都下到他那里。
{1Sa 22:2}  And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, gathered to him. And he became commander over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.
{1Sa 22:2}  凡受窘迫的、欠债的、心里苦恼的都聚集到大卫那里；大卫就作他们的头目，跟随他的约有四百人。
{1Sa 22:3}  And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and my mother stay with you, till I know what God will do for me."
{1Sa 22:3}  大卫从那里往摩押的米斯巴去，对摩押王说：“求你容我父母搬来，住在你们这里，等我知道神要为我怎样行。”
{1Sa 22:4}  And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
{1Sa 22:4}  大卫领他父母到摩押王面前。大卫住山寨多少日子，他父母也住摩押王那里多少日子。
{1Sa 22:5}  Then the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah." So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.
{1Sa 22:5}  先知迦得对大卫说：“你不要住在山寨，要往犹大地去。”大卫就离开那里，进入哈列的树林。
{1Sa 22:6}  Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.
{1Sa 22:6}  扫罗在基比亚的拉玛，坐在垂丝柳树下，手里拿着枪，众臣仆侍立在左右。扫罗听见大卫和跟随他的人在何处，
{1Sa 22:7}  And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, "Hear now, people of Benjamin; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,
{1Sa 22:7}  就对左右侍立的臣仆说：“便雅悯人哪，你们要听我的话！耶西的儿子能将田地和葡萄园赐给你们各人吗？能立你们各人作千夫长百夫长吗？
{1Sa 22:8}  that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day."
{1Sa 22:8}  你们竟都结党害我！我的儿子与耶西的儿子结盟的时候，无人告诉我；我的儿子挑唆我的臣子谋害我，就如今日的光景，也无人告诉我，为我忧虑。”
{1Sa 22:9}  Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, "I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub,
{1Sa 22:9}  那时以东人多益站在扫罗的臣仆中，对他说：“我曾看见耶西的儿子到了挪伯，亚希突的儿子亚希米勒那里。
{1Sa 22:10} and he inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
{1Sa 22:10} 亚希米勒为他求问耶和华，又给他食物，并给他杀非利士人歌利亚的刀。”
{1Sa 22:11} Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were at Nob, and all of them came to the king.
{1Sa 22:11} 王就打发人将祭司亚希突的儿子亚希米勒和他父亲的全家，就是住挪伯的祭司都召了来；他们就来见王。
{1Sa 22:12} And Saul said, "Hear now, son of Ahitub." And he answered, "Here I am, my lord."
{1Sa 22:12} 扫罗说：“亚希突的儿子，要听我的话！”他回答说：“主啊，我在这里。”
{1Sa 22:13} And Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
{1Sa 22:13} 扫罗对他说：“你为什么与耶西的儿子结党害我，将食物和刀给他，又为他求问神，使他起来谋害我，就如今日的光景？”
{1Sa 22:14} Then Ahimelech answered the king, "And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and captain over your bodyguard, and honored in your house?
{1Sa 22:14} 亚希米勒回答王说：“王的臣仆中有谁比大卫忠心呢？他是王的女婿，又是王的参谋，并且在王家中是尊贵的。
{1Sa 22:15} Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father, for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little."
{1Sa 22:15} 我岂是从今日才为他求问神呢？断不是这样！王不要将罪归我和我父的全家；因为这事，无论大小，仆人都不知道。”
{1Sa 22:16} And the king said, "You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house."
{1Sa 22:16} 王说：“亚希米勒啊，你和你父的全家都是该死的！”
{1Sa 22:17} And the king said to the guard who stood about him, "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David, and they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me." But the servants of the king would not put out their hand to strike the priests of the LORD.
{1Sa 22:17} 王就吩咐左右的侍卫说：“你们去杀耶和华的祭司；因为他们帮助大卫，又知道大卫逃跑，竟没有告诉我。”扫罗的臣子却不肯伸手杀耶和华的祭司。
{1Sa 22:18} Then the king said to Doeg, "You turn and strike the priests." And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.
{1Sa 22:18} 王吩咐多益说：“你去杀祭司吧！”以东人多益就去杀祭司，那日杀了穿细麻布以弗得的八十五人；
{1Sa 22:19} And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both man and woman, child and infant, ox, donkey and sheep, he put to the sword.
{1Sa 22:19} 又用刀将祭司城挪伯中的男女、孩童、吃奶的，和牛、羊、驴尽都杀灭。
{1Sa 22:20} But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
{1Sa 22:20} 亚希突的儿子亚希米勒有一个儿子，名叫亚比亚他，逃到大卫那里。
{1Sa 22:21} And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
{1Sa 22:21} 亚比亚他将扫罗杀耶和华祭司的事告诉大卫。
{1Sa 22:22} And David said to Abiathar, "I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father's house.
{1Sa 22:22} 大卫对亚比亚他说：“那日我见以东人多益在那里，就知道他必告诉扫罗。你父的全家丧命，都是因我的缘故。
{1Sa 22:23} Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. With me you shall be in safekeeping."
{1Sa 22:23} 你可以住在我这里，不要惧怕。因为寻索你命的就是寻索我的命；你在我这里可得保全。”
{1Sa 23:1}  Now they told David, "Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors."
{1Sa 23:1}  有人告诉大卫说：“非利士人攻击基伊拉，抢夺禾场。”
{1Sa 23:2}  Therefore David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" And the LORD said to David, "Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah."
{1Sa 23:2}  所以大卫求问耶和华说：“我去攻打那些非利士人可以不可以？”耶和华对大卫说：“你可以去攻打非利士人，拯救基伊拉。”
{1Sa 23:3}  But David's men said to him, "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
{1Sa 23:3}  跟随大卫的人对他说：“我们在犹大地这里尚且惧怕，何况往基伊拉去攻打非利士人的军旅呢？”
{1Sa 23:4}  Then David inquired of the LORD again. And the LORD answered him, "Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand."
{1Sa 23:4}  大卫又求问耶和华。耶和华回答说：“你起身下基伊拉去，我必将非利士人交在你手里。”
{1Sa 23:5}  And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and brought away their livestock and struck them with a great blow. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
{1Sa 23:5}  大卫和跟随他的人往基伊拉去，与非利士人打仗，大大杀败他们，又夺获他们的牲畜。这样，大卫救了基伊拉的居民。
{1Sa 23:6}  When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech had fled to David to Keilah, he had come down with an ephod in his hand.
{1Sa 23:6}  亚希米勒的儿子亚比亚他逃到基伊拉见大卫的时候，手里拿着以弗得。
{1Sa 23:7}  Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, "God has given him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars."
{1Sa 23:7}  有人告诉扫罗说：“大卫到了基伊拉。”扫罗说：“他进了有门有闩的城，困闭在里头；这是神将他交在我手里了。”
{1Sa 23:8}  And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
{1Sa 23:8}  于是扫罗招聚众民，要下去攻打基伊拉城，围困大卫和跟随他的人。
{1Sa 23:9}  David knew that Saul was plotting harm against him. And he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod here."
{1Sa 23:9}  大卫知道扫罗设计谋害他，就对祭司亚比亚他说：“将以弗得拿过来。”
{1Sa 23:10} Then David said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my account.
{1Sa 23:10} 大卫祷告说：“耶和华以色列的神啊，你仆人听真了扫罗要往基伊拉来，为我的缘故灭城。
{1Sa 23:11} Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, the God of Israel, please tell your servant." And the LORD said, "He will come down."
{1Sa 23:11} 基伊拉人将我交在扫罗手里不交？扫罗照着你仆人所听的话下来不下来？耶和华以色列的神啊，求你指示仆人！”耶和华说：“扫罗必下来。”
{1Sa 23:12} Then David said, "Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will surrender you."
{1Sa 23:12} 大卫又说：“基伊拉人将我和跟随我的人交在扫罗手里不交？”耶和华说：“必交出来。”
{1Sa 23:13} Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition.
{1Sa 23:13} 大卫和跟随他的约有六百人，就起身出了基伊拉，往他们所能往的地方去。有人告诉扫罗，大卫离开基伊拉逃走；于是扫罗不出来了。
{1Sa 23:14} And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.
{1Sa 23:14} 大卫住在旷野的山寨里，常在西弗旷野的山地。扫罗天天寻索大卫，神却不将大卫交在他手里。
{1Sa 23:15} David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.
{1Sa 23:15} 大卫知道扫罗出来寻索他的命。那时，他住在西弗旷野的树林里；
{1Sa 23:16} And Jonathan, Saul's son, rose and went to David at Horesh, and strengthened his hand in God.
{1Sa 23:16} 扫罗的儿子约拿单起身，往那树林里去见大卫，使他倚靠神得以坚固，
{1Sa 23:17} And he said to him, "Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Saul my father also knows this."
{1Sa 23:17} 对他说：“不要惧怕！我父扫罗的手必不加害于你；你必作以色列的王，我也作你的宰相。这事我父扫罗知道了。”
{1Sa 23:18} And the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.
{1Sa 23:18} 于是二人在耶和华面前立约。大卫仍住在树林里，约拿单回家去了。
{1Sa 23:19} Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon?
{1Sa 23:19} 西弗人上到基比亚见扫罗，说：“大卫不是在我们那里的树林里山寨中、旷野南边的哈基拉山藏着吗？
{1Sa 23:20} Now come down, O king, according to all your heart's desire to come down, and our part shall be to surrender him into the king's hand."
{1Sa 23:20} 王啊，请你随你的心愿下来，我们必亲自将他交在王的手里。”
{1Sa 23:21} And Saul said, "May you be blessed by the LORD, for you have had compassion on me.
{1Sa 23:21} 扫罗说：“愿耶和华赐福与你们，因你们顾恤我。
{1Sa 23:22} Go, make yet more sure. Know and see the place where his foot is, and who has seen him there, for it is told me that he is very cunning.
{1Sa 23:22} 请你们回去，再确实查明他的住处和行踪，是谁看见他在那里，因为我听见人说他甚狡猾。
{1Sa 23:23} See therefore and take note of all the lurking places where he hides, and come back to me with sure information. Then I will go with you. And if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah."
{1Sa 23:23} 所以要看准他藏匿的地方，回来据实地告诉我，我就与你们同去。他若在犹大的境内，我必从千门万户中搜出他来。”
{1Sa 23:24} And they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.
{1Sa 23:24} 西弗人就起身，在扫罗以先往西弗去。大卫和跟随他的人却在玛云旷野南边的亚拉巴。
{1Sa 23:25} And Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told, so he went down to the rock and lived in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
{1Sa 23:25} 扫罗和跟随他的人去寻找大卫；有人告诉大卫，他就下到磐石，住在玛云的旷野。扫罗听见，便在玛云的旷野追赶大卫。
{1Sa 23:26} Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David was hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them,
{1Sa 23:26} 扫罗在山这边走，大卫和跟随他的人在山那边走。大卫急忙躲避扫罗；因为扫罗和跟随他的人，四面围住大卫和跟随他的人，要拿获他们。
{1Sa 23:27} a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid against the land."
{1Sa 23:27} 忽有使者来报告扫罗说：“非利士人犯境抢掠，请王快快回去！”
{1Sa 23:28} So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. Therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape.
{1Sa 23:28} 于是扫罗不追赶大卫，回去攻打非利士人。因此那地方名叫西拉哈玛希罗结。
{1Sa 23:29} And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of Engedi.
{1Sa 23:29} 大卫从那里上去，住在隐基底的山寨里。
{1Sa 24:1}  When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, "Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi."
{1Sa 24:1}  扫罗追赶非利士人回来，有人告诉他说：“大卫在隐基底的旷野。”
{1Sa 24:2}  Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats' Rocks.
{1Sa 24:2}  扫罗就从以色列人中挑选三千精兵，率领他们往野羊的磐石去，寻索大卫和跟随他的人。
{1Sa 24:3}  And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.
{1Sa 24:3}  到了路旁的羊圈，在那里有洞，扫罗进去大解。大卫和跟随他的人正藏在洞里的深处。
{1Sa 24:4}  And the men of David said to him, "Here is the day of which the LORD said to you, 'Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.'" Then David arose and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul's robe.
{1Sa 24:4}  跟随的人对大卫说：“耶和华曾应许你说：‘我要将你的仇敌交在你手里，你可以任意待他。’如今时候到了！”大卫就起来，悄悄地割下扫罗外袍的衣襟。
{1Sa 24:5}  And afterward David's heart struck him, because he had cut off a corner of Saul's robe.
{1Sa 24:5}  随后大卫心中自责，因为割下扫罗的衣襟；
{1Sa 24:6}  He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD's anointed, to put out my hand against him, seeing he is the LORD's anointed."
{1Sa 24:6}  对跟随他的人说：“我的主乃是耶和华的受膏者，我在耶和华面前万不敢伸手害他，因他是耶和华的受膏者。”
{1Sa 24:7}  So David persuaded his men with these words and did not permit them to attack Saul. And Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way.
{1Sa 24:7}  大卫用这话拦住跟随他的人，不容他们起来害扫罗。扫罗起来，从洞里出去行路。
{1Sa 24:8}  Afterward David also arose and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, "My lord the king!" And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage.
{1Sa 24:8}  随后大卫也起来，从洞里出去，呼叫扫罗说：“我主，我王！”扫罗回头观看，大卫就屈身、脸伏于地下拜。
{1Sa 24:9}  And David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to the words of men who say, 'Behold, David seeks your harm'?
{1Sa 24:9}  大卫对扫罗说：“你为何听信人的谗言，说大卫想要害你呢？
{1Sa 24:10} Behold, this day your eyes have seen how the LORD gave you today into my hand in the cave. And some told me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, 'I will not put out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD's anointed.'
{1Sa 24:10} 今日你亲眼看见在洞中，耶和华将你交在我手里；有人叫我杀你，我却爱惜你，说：‘我不敢伸手害我的主，因为他是耶和华的受膏者。’
{1Sa 24:11} See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand. For by the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt my life to take it.
{1Sa 24:11} 我父啊，看看你外袍的衣襟在我手中。我割下你的衣襟，没有杀你；你由此可以知道我没有恶意叛逆你。你虽然猎取我的命，我却没有得罪你。
{1Sa 24:12} May the LORD judge between me and you, may the LORD avenge me against you, but my hand shall not be against you.
{1Sa 24:12} 愿耶和华在你我中间判断是非，在你身上为我伸冤，我却不亲手加害于你。
{1Sa 24:13} As the proverb of the ancients says, 'Out of the wicked comes wickedness.' But my hand shall not be against you.
{1Sa 24:13} 古人有句俗语说：‘恶事出于恶人。’我却不亲手加害于你。
{1Sa 24:14} After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog! After a flea!
{1Sa 24:14} 以色列王出来要寻找谁呢？追赶谁呢？不过追赶一条死狗，一个虼蚤就是了。
{1Sa 24:15} May the LORD therefore be judge and give sentence between me and you, and see to it and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand."
{1Sa 24:15} 愿耶和华在你我中间施行审判，断定是非，并且鉴察，为我伸冤，救我脱离你的手。”
{1Sa 24:16} As soon as David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
{1Sa 24:16} 大卫向扫罗说完这话，扫罗说：“我儿大卫，这是你的声音吗？”就放声大哭，
{1Sa 24:17} He said to David, "You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil.
{1Sa 24:17} 对大卫说：“你比我公义；因为你以善待我，我却以恶待你。
{1Sa 24:18} And you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the LORD put me into your hands.
{1Sa 24:18} 你今日显明是以善待我；因为耶和华将我交在你手里，你却没有杀我。
{1Sa 24:19} For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe? So may the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.
{1Sa 24:19} 人若遇见仇敌，岂肯放他平安无事地去呢？愿耶和华因你今日向我所行的，以善报你。
{1Sa 24:20} And now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
{1Sa 24:20} 我也知道你必要作王，以色列的国必坚立在你手里。
{1Sa 24:21} Swear to me therefore by the LORD that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house."
{1Sa 24:21} 现在你要指着耶和华向我起誓，不剪除我的后裔，在我父家不灭没我的名。”
{1Sa 24:22} And David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
{1Sa 24:22} 于是大卫向扫罗起誓，扫罗就回家去；大卫和跟随他的人上山寨去了。
{1Sa 25:1}  Now Samuel died. And all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him in his house at Ramah. Then David rose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
{1Sa 25:1}  撒母耳死了，以色列众人聚集，为他哀哭，将他葬在拉玛他自己的坟墓（原文作房屋）里。大卫起身，下到巴兰的旷野。
{1Sa 25:2}  And there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
{1Sa 25:2}  在玛云有一个人，他的产业在迦密，是一个大富户，有三千绵羊，一千山羊；他正在迦密剪羊毛。
{1Sa 25:3}  Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. The woman was discerning and beautiful, but the man was harsh and badly behaved; he was a Calebite.
{1Sa 25:3}  那人名叫拿八，是迦勒族的人；他的妻名叫亚比该，是聪明俊美的妇人。拿八为人刚愎凶恶。
{1Sa 25:4}  David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
{1Sa 25:4}  大卫在旷野听见说拿八剪羊毛，
{1Sa 25:5}  So David sent ten young men. And David said to the young men, "Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal and greet him in my name.
{1Sa 25:5}  大卫就打发十个仆人，吩咐他们说：“你们上迦密去见拿八，提我的名问他安。
{1Sa 25:6}  And thus you shall greet him: 'Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.
{1Sa 25:6}  要对那富户如此说：‘愿你平安，愿你家平安，愿你一切所有的都平安。
{1Sa 25:7}  I hear that you have shearers. Now your shepherds have been with us, and we did them no harm, and they missed nothing all the time they were in Carmel.
{1Sa 25:7}  现在我听说有人为你剪羊毛，你的牧人在迦密的时候和我们在一处，我们没有欺负他们，他们也未曾失落什么。
{1Sa 25:8}  Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on a feast day. Please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.'"
{1Sa 25:8}  可以问你的仆人，他们必告诉你。所以愿我的仆人在你眼前蒙恩，因为是在好日子来的。求你随手取点赐与仆人和你儿子大卫。’”
{1Sa 25:9}  When David's young men came, they said all this to Nabal in the name of David, and then they waited.
{1Sa 25:9}  大卫的仆人到了，将这话提大卫的名都告诉了拿八，就住了口。
{1Sa 25:10} And Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters.
{1Sa 25:10} 拿八回答大卫的仆人说：“大卫是谁？耶西的儿子是谁？近来悖逆主人奔逃的仆人甚多，
{1Sa 25:11} Shall I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers and give it to men who come from I do not know where?"
{1Sa 25:11} 我岂可将饮食和为我剪羊毛人所宰的肉给我不知道从那里来的人呢？”
{1Sa 25:12} So David's young men turned away and came back and told him all this.
{1Sa 25:12} 大卫的仆人就转身从原路回去，照这话告诉大卫。
{1Sa 25:13} And David said to his men, "Every man strap on his sword!" And every man of them strapped on his sword. David also strapped on his sword. And about four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.
{1Sa 25:13} 大卫向跟随他的人说：“你们各人都要带上刀！”众人就都带上刀，大卫也带上刀。跟随大卫上去的约有四百人，留下二百人看守器具。
{1Sa 25:14} But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master, and he railed at them.
{1Sa 25:14} 有拿八的一个仆人告诉拿八的妻亚比该说：“大卫从旷野打发使者来问我主人的安，主人却辱骂他们。
{1Sa 25:15} Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them.
{1Sa 25:15} 但是那些人待我们甚好；我们在田野与他们来往的时候，没有受他们的欺负，也未曾失落什么。
{1Sa 25:16} They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
{1Sa 25:16} 我们在他们那里牧羊的时候，他们昼夜作我们的保障。
{1Sa 25:17} Now therefore know this and consider what you should do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is such a worthless man that one cannot speak to him."
{1Sa 25:17} 所以你当筹划，看怎样行才好；不然，祸患定要临到我主人和他全家。他性情凶暴，无人敢与他说话。”
{1Sa 25:18} Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two skins of wine and five sheep already prepared and five seahs of parched grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.
{1Sa 25:18} 亚比该急忙将二百饼，两皮袋酒，五只收拾好了的羊，五细亚烘好了的穗子，一百葡萄饼，二百无花果饼，都驮在驴上，
{1Sa 25:19} And she said to her young men, "Go on before me; behold, I come after you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
{1Sa 25:19} 对仆人说：“你们前头走，我随着你们去。”这事他却没有告诉丈夫拿八。
{1Sa 25:20} And as she rode on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them.
{1Sa 25:20} 亚比该骑着驴，正下山坡，见大卫和跟随他的人从对面下来，亚比该就迎接他们。
{1Sa 25:21} Now David had said, "Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good.
{1Sa 25:21} 大卫曾说：“我在旷野为那人看守所有的，以致他一样不失落，实在是徒然了！他向我以恶报善。
{1Sa 25:22} God do so to the enemies of David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him."
{1Sa 25:22} 凡属拿八的男丁，我若留一个到明日早晨，愿神重重降罚与我！”
{1Sa 25:23} When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell before David on her face and bowed to the ground.
{1Sa 25:23} 亚比该见大卫，便急忙下驴，在大卫面前脸伏于地叩拜，
{1Sa 25:24} She fell at his feet and said, "On me alone, my lord, be the guilt. Please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant.
{1Sa 25:24} 俯伏在大卫的脚前，说：“我主啊，愿这罪归我！求你容婢女向你进言，更求你听婢女的话。
{1Sa 25:25} Let not my lord regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.
{1Sa 25:25} 我主不要理这坏人拿八，他的性情与他的名相称；他名叫拿八（就是愚顽的意思），他为人果然愚顽。但我主所打发的仆人，婢女并没有看见。
{1Sa 25:26} Now then, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, because the LORD has restrained you from bloodguilt and from saving with your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal.
{1Sa 25:26} 我主啊，耶和华既然阻止你亲手报仇，取流血的罪，所以我指着永生的耶和华、又敢在你面前起誓说：‘愿你的仇敌和谋害你的人都像拿八一样。’
{1Sa 25:27} And now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord.
{1Sa 25:27} 如今求你将婢女送来的礼物给跟随你的仆人。
{1Sa 25:28} Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live.
{1Sa 25:28} 求你饶恕婢女的罪过。耶和华必为我主建立坚固的家，因我主为耶和华争战；并且在你平生的日子查不出有什么过来。
{1Sa 25:29} If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the LORD your God. And the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.
{1Sa 25:29} 虽有人起来追逼你，寻索你的性命，你的性命却在耶和华你的神那里蒙保护，如包裹宝器一样；你仇敌的性命，耶和华必抛去，如用机弦甩石一样。
{1Sa 25:30} And when the LORD has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you and has appointed you prince over Israel,
{1Sa 25:30} (SEE 25:31)
{1Sa 25:31} my lord shall have no cause of grief or pangs of conscience for having shed blood without cause or for my lord working salvation himself. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant."
{1Sa 25:31} 我主现在若不亲手报仇流无辜人的血，到了耶和华照所应许你的话赐福与你，立你作以色列的王，那时我主必不至心里不安，觉得良心有亏。耶和华赐福与我主的时候，求你记念婢女。”
{1Sa 25:32} And David said to Abigail, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!
{1Sa 25:32} 大卫对亚比该说：“耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的，因为他今日使你来迎接我。
{1Sa 25:33} Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt and from working salvation with my own hand!
{1Sa 25:33} 你和你的见识也当称赞；因为你今日拦阻我亲手报仇、流人的血。
{1Sa 25:34} For as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has restrained me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, truly by morning there had not been left to Nabal so much as one male."
{1Sa 25:34} 我指着阻止我加害于你的耶和华以色列永生的神起誓，你若不速速地来迎接我，到明日早晨，凡属拿八的男丁必定不留一个。”
{1Sa 25:35} Then David received from her hand what she had brought him. And he said to her, "Go up in peace to your house. See, I have obeyed your voice, and I have granted your petition."
{1Sa 25:35} 大卫受了亚比该送来的礼物，就对他说：“我听了你的话，准了你的情面，你可以平平安安的回家吧！”
{1Sa 25:36} And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until the morning light.
{1Sa 25:36} 亚比该到拿八那里，见他在家里设摆筵席，如同王的筵席；拿八快乐大醉。亚比该无论大小事都没有告诉他，就等到次日早晨。
{1Sa 25:37} In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
{1Sa 25:37} 到了早晨，拿八醒了酒，他的妻将这些事都告诉他，他就魂不附体，身僵如石头一般。
{1Sa 25:38} And about ten days later the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.
{1Sa 25:38} 过了十天，耶和华击打拿八，他就死了。
{1Sa 25:39} When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Blessed be the LORD who has avenged the insult I received at the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from wrongdoing. The LORD has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head." Then David sent and spoke to Abigail, to take her as his wife.
{1Sa 25:39} 大卫听见拿八死了，就说：“应当称颂耶和华，因他伸了拿八羞辱我的冤，又阻止仆人行恶；也使拿八的恶归到拿八的头上。”于是大卫打发人去，与亚比该说，要娶他为妻。
{1Sa 25:40} When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, "David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife."
{1Sa 25:40} 大卫的仆人到了迦密见亚比该，对他说：“大卫打发我们来见你，想要娶你为妻。”
{1Sa 25:41} And she rose and bowed with her face to the ground and said, "Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
{1Sa 25:41} 亚比该就起来，俯伏在地，说：“我情愿作婢女，洗我主仆人的脚。”
{1Sa 25:42} And Abigail hurried and rose and mounted a donkey, and her five young women attended her. She followed the messengers of David and became his wife.
{1Sa 25:42} 亚比该立刻起身，骑上驴，带着五个使女，跟从大卫的使者去了，就作了大卫的妻。
{1Sa 25:43} David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and both of them became his wives.
{1Sa 25:43} 大卫先娶了耶斯列人亚希暖，他们二人都作了他的妻。
{1Sa 25:44} Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
{1Sa 25:44} 扫罗已将他的女儿米甲，就是大卫的妻，给了迦琳人拉亿的儿子帕提为妻。
{1Sa 26:1}  Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the east of Jeshimon?"
{1Sa 26:1}  西弗人到基比亚见扫罗，说：“大卫不是在旷野前的哈基拉山藏着吗？”
{1Sa 26:2}  So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph with three thousand chosen men of Israel to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
{1Sa 26:2}  扫罗就起身，带领以色列人中挑选的三千精兵下到西弗的旷野，要在那里寻索大卫。
{1Sa 26:3}  And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road on the east of Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness,
{1Sa 26:3}  扫罗在旷野前的哈基拉山，在道路上安营。大卫住在旷野，听说扫罗到旷野来追寻他，
{1Sa 26:4}  David sent out spies and learned that Saul had indeed come.
{1Sa 26:4}  就打发人去探听，便知道扫罗果然来到。
{1Sa 26:5}  Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul was lying within the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.
{1Sa 26:5}  大卫起来，到扫罗安营的地方，看见扫罗和他的元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥睡卧之处；扫罗睡在辎重营里，百姓安营在他周围。
{1Sa 26:6}  Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab's brother Abishai the son of Zeruiah, "Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?" And Abishai said, "I will go down with you."
{1Sa 26:6}  大卫对赫人亚希米勒和洗鲁雅的儿子约押的兄弟亚比筛说：“谁同我下到扫罗营里去？”亚比筛说：“我同你下去。”
{1Sa 26:7}  So David and Abishai went to the army by night. And there lay Saul sleeping within the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the army lay around him.
{1Sa 26:7}  于是大卫和亚比筛夜间到了百姓那里，见扫罗睡在辎重营里；他的枪在头旁，插在地上。押尼珥和百姓睡在他周围。
{1Sa 26:8}  Then Abishai said to David, "God has given your enemy into your hand this day. Now please let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice."
{1Sa 26:8}  亚比筛对大卫说：“现在神将你的仇敌交在你手里，求你容我拿枪将他刺透在地，一刺就成，不用再刺。”
{1Sa 26:9}  But David said to Abishai, "Do not destroy him, for who can put out his hand against the LORD's anointed and be guiltless?"
{1Sa 26:9}  大卫对亚比筛说：“不可害死他。有谁伸手害耶和华的受膏者而无罪呢？”
{1Sa 26:10} And David said, "As the LORD lives, the LORD will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and perish.
{1Sa 26:10} 大卫又说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，他或被耶和华击打，或是死期到了，或是出战阵亡；
{1Sa 26:11} The LORD forbid that I should put out my hand against the LORD's anointed. But take now the spear that is at his head and the jar of water, and let us go."
{1Sa 26:11} 我在耶和华面前，万不敢伸手害耶和华的受膏者。现在你可以将他头旁的枪和水瓶拿来，我们就走。”
{1Sa 26:12} So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head, and they went away. No man saw it or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.
{1Sa 26:12} 大卫从扫罗的头旁拿了枪和水瓶，二人就走了，没有人看见，没有人知道，也没有人醒起，都睡着了，因为耶和华使他们沉沉地睡了。
{1Sa 26:13} Then David went over to the other side and stood far off on the top of the hill, with a great space between them.
{1Sa 26:13} 大卫过到那边去，远远的站在山顶上，与他们相离甚远。
{1Sa 26:14} And David called to the army, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, "Will you not answer, Abner?" Then Abner answered, "Who are you who calls to the king?"
{1Sa 26:14} 大卫呼叫百姓和尼珥的儿子押尼珥说：“押尼珥啊，你为何不答应呢？”押尼珥说：“你是谁？竟敢呼叫王呢？”
{1Sa 26:15} And David said to Abner, "Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.
{1Sa 26:15} 大卫对押尼珥说：“你不是个勇士吗？以色列中谁能比你呢？民中有人进来要害死王你的主，你为何没有保护王你的主呢？
{1Sa 26:16} This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is and the jar of water that was at his head."
{1Sa 26:16} 你这样是不好的！我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你们都是该死的；因为没有保护你们的主，就是耶和华的受膏者。现在你看看王头旁的枪和水瓶在那里。”
{1Sa 26:17} Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And David said, "It is my voice, my lord, O king."
{1Sa 26:17} 扫罗听出是大卫的声音，就说：“我儿大卫，这是你的声音吗？”大卫说：“主我的王啊，是我的声音”；
{1Sa 26:18} And he said, "Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? What evil is on my hands?
{1Sa 26:18} 又说：“我做了什么？我手里有什么恶事？我主竟追赶仆人呢？
{1Sa 26:19} Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the LORD who has stirred you up against me, may he accept an offering, but if it is men, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day that I should have no share in the heritage of the LORD, saying, 'Go, serve other gods.'
{1Sa 26:19} 求我主我王听仆人的话：若是耶和华激发你攻击我，愿耶和华收纳祭物；若是人激发你，愿他在耶和华面前受咒诅；因为他现今赶逐我，不容我在耶和华的产业上有分，说：‘你去事奉别神吧！’
{1Sa 26:20} Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the LORD, for the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains."
{1Sa 26:20} 现在求王不要使我的血流在离耶和华远的地方。以色列王出来是寻找一个虼蚤，如同人在山上猎取一个鹧鸪一般。”
{1Sa 26:21} Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have acted foolishly, and have made a great mistake."
{1Sa 26:21} 扫罗说：“我有罪了！我儿大卫，你可以回来，因你今日看我的性命为宝贵；我必不再加害于你。我是糊涂人，大大错了。”
{1Sa 26:22} And David answered and said, "Here is the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and take it.
{1Sa 26:22} 大卫说：“王的枪在这里，可以吩咐一个仆人过来拿去。
{1Sa 26:23} The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness, for the LORD gave you into my hand today, and I would not put out my hand against the LORD's anointed.
{1Sa 26:23} 今日耶和华将王交在我手里，我却不肯伸手害耶和华的受膏者。耶和华必照各人的公义诚实报应他。
{1Sa 26:24} Behold, as your life was precious this day in my sight, so may my life be precious in the sight of the LORD, and may he deliver me out of all tribulation."
{1Sa 26:24} 我今日重看你的性命，愿耶和华也重看我的性命，并且拯救我脱离一切患难。”
{1Sa 26:25} Then Saul said to David, "Blessed be you, my son David! You will do many things and will succeed in them." So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
{1Sa 26:25} 扫罗对大卫说：“我儿大卫，愿你得福！你必做大事，也必得胜。”于是大卫起行，扫罗回他的本处去了。
{1Sa 27:1}  Then David said in his heart, "Now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand."
{1Sa 27:1}  大卫心里说：“必有一日我死在扫罗手里，不如逃奔非利士地去。扫罗见我不在以色列的境内，就必绝望，不再寻索我；这样我可以脱离他的手。”
{1Sa 27:2}  So David arose and went over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
{1Sa 27:2}  于是大卫起身，和跟随他的六百人投奔迦特王玛俄的儿子亚吉去了。
{1Sa 27:3}  And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal's widow.
{1Sa 27:3}  大卫和他的两个妻，就是耶斯列人亚希暖和作过拿八妻的迦密人亚比该，并跟随他的人，连各人的眷属，都住在迦特的亚吉那里。
{1Sa 27:4}  And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, he no longer sought him.
{1Sa 27:4}  有人告诉扫罗说：“大卫逃到迦特。”扫罗就不再寻索他了。
{1Sa 27:5}  Then David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be given me in one of the country towns, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?"
{1Sa 27:5}  大卫对亚吉说：“我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你在京外的城邑中赐我一个地方居住。仆人何必与王同住京都呢？”
{1Sa 27:6}  So that day Achish gave him Ziklag. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
{1Sa 27:6}  当日亚吉将洗革拉赐给他，因此洗革拉属犹大王，直到今日。
{1Sa 27:7}  And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.
{1Sa 27:7}  大卫在非利士地住了一年零四个月。
{1Sa 27:8}  Now David and his men went up and made raids against the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for these were the inhabitants of the land from of old, as far as Shur, to the land of Egypt.
{1Sa 27:8}  大卫和跟随他的人上去，侵夺基述人、基色人、亚玛力人之地。这几族历来住在那地，从书珥直到埃及。
{1Sa 27:9}  And David would strike the land and would leave neither man nor woman alive, but would take away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the garments, and come back to Achish.
{1Sa 27:9}  大卫击杀那地的人，无论男女都没有留下一个，又夺获牛、羊、骆驼、驴，并衣服，回来见亚吉。
{1Sa 27:10} When Achish asked, "Where have you made a raid today?" David would say, "Against the Negeb of Judah," or, "Against the Negeb of the Jerahmeelites," or, "Against the Negeb of the Kenites."
{1Sa 27:10} 亚吉说：“你们今日侵夺了什么地方呢？”大卫说：“侵夺了犹大的南方、耶拉篾的南方、基尼的南方。”
{1Sa 27:11} And David would leave neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath, thinking, "lest they should tell about us and say, 'So David has done.'" Such was his custom all the while he lived in the country of the Philistines.
{1Sa 27:11} 无论男女，大卫没有留下一个带到迦特来。他说：“恐怕他们将我们的事告诉人，说大卫住在非利士地的时候常常这样行。”
{1Sa 27:12} And Achish trusted David, thinking, "He has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel; therefore he shall always be my servant."
{1Sa 27:12} 亚吉信了大卫，心里说：“大卫使本族以色列人憎恶他，所以他必永远作我的仆人了。”
{1Sa 28:1}  In those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, "Understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army."
{1Sa 28:1}  那时，非利士人聚集军旅，要与以色列人打仗。亚吉对大卫说：“你当知道，你和跟随你的人都要随我出战。”
{1Sa 28:2}  David said to Achish, "Very well, you shall know what your servant can do." And Achish said to David, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life."
{1Sa 28:2}  大卫对亚吉说：“仆人所能做的事，王必知道。”亚吉对大卫说：“这样，我立你永远作我的护卫长。”
{1Sa 28:3}  Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the necromancers out of the land.
{1Sa 28:3}  那时撒母耳已经死了，以色列众人为他哀哭，葬他在拉玛，就是在他本城里。扫罗曾在国内不容有交鬼的和行巫术的人。
{1Sa 28:4}  The Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa.
{1Sa 28:4}  非利士人聚集，来到书念安营；扫罗聚集以色列众人在基利波安营。
{1Sa 28:5}  When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
{1Sa 28:5}  扫罗看见非利士的军旅就惧怕，心中发颤。
{1Sa 28:6}  And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets.
{1Sa 28:6}  扫罗求问耶和华，耶和华却不藉梦，或乌陵，或先知回答他。
{1Sa 28:7}  Then Saul said to his servants, "Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her." And his servants said to him, "Behold, there is a medium at En-dor."
{1Sa 28:7}  扫罗吩咐臣仆说：“当为我找一个交鬼的妇人，我好去问他。”臣仆说：“在隐多珥有一个交鬼的妇人。”
{1Sa 28:8}  So Saul disguised himself and put on other garments and went, he and two men with him. And they came to the woman by night. And he said, "Divine for me by a spirit and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you."
{1Sa 28:8}  于是扫罗改了装，穿上别的衣服，带着两个人，夜里去见那妇人。扫罗说：“求你用交鬼的法术，将我所告诉你的死人，为我招上来。”
{1Sa 28:9}  The woman said to him, "Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the necromancers from the land. Why then are you laying a trap for my life to bring about my death?"
{1Sa 28:9}  妇人对他说：“你知道扫罗从国中剪除交鬼的和行巫术的。你为何陷害我的性命，使我死呢？”
{1Sa 28:10} But Saul swore to her by the LORD, "As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing."
{1Sa 28:10} 扫罗向妇人指着耶和华起誓说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你必不因这事受刑。”
{1Sa 28:11} Then the woman said, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" He said, "Bring up Samuel for me."
{1Sa 28:11} 妇人说：“我为你招谁上来呢？”回答说：“为我招撒母耳上来。”
{1Sa 28:12} When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul."
{1Sa 28:12} 妇人看见撒母耳，就大声呼叫，对扫罗说：“你是扫罗，为什么欺哄我呢？”
{1Sa 28:13} The king said to her, "Do not be afraid. What do you see?" And the woman said to Saul, "I see a god coming up out of the earth."
{1Sa 28:13} 王对妇人说：“不要惧怕，你看见了什么呢？”妇人对扫罗说：“我看见有神从地里上来。”
{1Sa 28:14} He said to her, "What is his appearance?" And she said, "An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe." And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage.
{1Sa 28:14} 扫罗说：“他是怎样的形状？”妇人说：“有一个老人上来，身穿长衣。”扫罗知道是撒母耳，就屈身，脸伏于地下拜。
{1Sa 28:15} Then Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" Saul answered, "I am in great distress, for the Philistines are warring against me, and God has turned away from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have summoned you to tell me what I shall do."
{1Sa 28:15} 撒母耳对扫罗说：“你为什么搅扰我，招我上来呢？”扫罗回答说：“我甚窘急；因为非利士人攻击我，神也离开我，不再藉先知或梦回答我。因此请你上来，好指示我应当怎样行。”
{1Sa 28:16} And Samuel said, "Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has turned from you and become your enemy?
{1Sa 28:16} 撒母耳说：“耶和华已经离开你，且与你为敌，你何必问我呢？
{1Sa 28:17} The LORD has done to you as he spoke by me, for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David.
{1Sa 28:17} 耶和华照他藉我说的话，已经从你手里夺去国权，赐与别人，就是大卫。
{1Sa 28:18} Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day.
{1Sa 28:18} 因你没有听从耶和华的命令；他恼怒亚玛力人，你没有灭绝他们，所以今日耶和华向你这样行，
{1Sa 28:19} Moreover, the LORD will give Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me. The LORD will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines."
{1Sa 28:19} 并且耶和华必将你和以色列人交在非利士人的手里。明日你和你众子必与我在一处了；耶和华必将以色列的军兵交在非利士人手里。”
{1Sa 28:20} Then Saul fell at once full length on the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.
{1Sa 28:20} 扫罗猛然仆倒，挺身在地，因撒母耳的话甚是惧怕；那一昼一夜没有吃什么，就毫无气力。
{1Sa 28:21} And the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was terrified, she said to him, "Behold, your servant has obeyed you. I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to what you have said to me.
{1Sa 28:21} 妇人到扫罗面前，见他极其惊恐，对他说：“婢女听从你的话，不顾惜自己的性命，遵从你所吩咐的。
{1Sa 28:22} Now therefore, you also obey your servant. Let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way."
{1Sa 28:22} 现在求你听婢女的话，容我在你面前摆上一点食物，你吃了，可以有气力行路。”
{1Sa 28:23} He refused and said, "I will not eat." But his servants, together with the woman, urged him, and he listened to their words. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.
{1Sa 28:23} 扫罗不肯，说：“我不吃。”但他的仆人和妇人再三劝他，他才听了他们的话，从地上起来，坐在床上。
{1Sa 28:24} Now the woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and she took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread of it,
{1Sa 28:24} 妇人急忙将家里的一只肥牛犊宰了，又拿面抟成无酵饼烤了，
{1Sa 28:25} and she put it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.
{1Sa 28:25} 摆在扫罗和他仆人面前。他们吃完，当夜就起身走了。
{1Sa 29:1}  Now the Philistines had gathered all their forces at Aphek. And the Israelites were encamped by the spring that is in Jezreel.
{1Sa 29:1}  非利士人将他们的军旅聚到亚弗；以色列人在耶斯列的泉旁安营。
{1Sa 29:2}  As the lords of the Philistines were passing on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were passing on in the rear with Achish,
{1Sa 29:2}  非利士人的首领各率军队，或百或千，挨次前进；大卫和跟随他的人同着亚吉跟在后边。
{1Sa 29:3}  the commanders of the Philistines said, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, "Is this not David, the servant of Saul, king of Israel, who has been with me now for days and years, and since he deserted to me I have found no fault in him to this day."
{1Sa 29:3}  非利士人的首领说：“这些希伯来人在这里做什么呢？”亚吉对他们说：“这不是以色列王扫罗的臣子大卫吗？他在我这里有些年日了。自从他投降我直到今日，我未曾见他有过错。”
{1Sa 29:4}  But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him. And the commanders of the Philistines said to him, "Send the man back, that he may return to the place to which you have assigned him. He shall not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of the men here?
{1Sa 29:4}  非利士人的首领向亚吉发怒，对他说：“你要叫这人回你所安置他的地方，不可叫他同我们出战，恐怕他在阵上反为我们的敌人。他用什么与他主人复和呢？岂不是用我们这些人的首级吗？
{1Sa 29:5}  Is not this David, of whom they sing to one another in dances, 'Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
{1Sa 29:5}  从前以色列的妇女跳舞唱和说：‘扫罗杀死千千，大卫杀死万万’，所说的不是这个大卫吗？”
{1Sa 29:6}  Then Achish called David and said to him, "As the LORD lives, you have been honest, and to me it seems right that you should march out and in with me in the campaign. For I have found nothing wrong in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, the lords do not approve of you.
{1Sa 29:6}  亚吉叫大卫来，对他说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你是正直人。你随我在军中出入，我看你甚好。自从你投奔我到如今，我未曾见你有什么过失；只是众首领不喜悦你。
{1Sa 29:7}  So go back now; and go peaceably, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines."
{1Sa 29:7}  现在你可以平平安安的回去，免得非利士人的首领不欢喜你。”
{1Sa 29:8}  And David said to Achish, "But what have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service until now, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
{1Sa 29:8}  大卫对亚吉说：“我做了什么呢？自从仆人到你面前，直到今日，你查出我有什么过错，使我不去攻击主我王的仇敌呢？”
{1Sa 29:9}  And Achish answered David and said, "I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God. Nevertheless, the commanders of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'
{1Sa 29:9}  亚吉说：“我知道你在我眼前是好人，如同神的使者一般；只是非利士人的首领说：‘这人不可同我们出战。’
{1Sa 29:10} Now then rise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you, and start early in the morning, and depart as soon as you have light."
{1Sa 29:10} 故此你和跟随你的人，就是你本主的仆人，要明日早晨起来，等到天亮回去吧！”
{1Sa 29:11} So David set out with his men early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
{1Sa 29:11} 于是大卫和跟随他的人早晨起来，回往非利士地去。非利士人也上耶斯列去了。
{1Sa 30:1}  Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid against the Negeb and against Ziklag. They had overcome Ziklag and burned it with fire
{1Sa 30:1}  第三日，大卫和跟随他的人到了洗革拉。亚玛力人已经侵夺南地，攻破洗革拉，用火焚烧，
{1Sa 30:2}  and taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They killed no one, but carried them off and went their way.
{1Sa 30:2}  掳了城内的妇女和其中的大小人口，却没有杀一个，都带着走了。
{1Sa 30:3}  And when David and his men came to the city, they found it burned with fire, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
{1Sa 30:3}  大卫和跟随他的人到了那城，不料，城已烧毁，他们的妻子儿女都被掳去了。
{1Sa 30:4}  Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until they had no more strength to weep.
{1Sa 30:4}  大卫和跟随他的人就放声大哭，直哭得没有气力。
{1Sa 30:5}  David's two wives also had been taken captive, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
{1Sa 30:5}  大卫的两个妻耶斯列人亚希暖和作过拿八妻的迦密人亚比该，也被掳去了。
{1Sa 30:6}  And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul, each for his sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.
{1Sa 30:6}  大卫甚是焦急，因众人为自己的儿女苦恼，说：“要用石头打死他。”大卫却倚靠耶和华他的神，心里坚固。
{1Sa 30:7}  And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
{1Sa 30:7}  大卫对亚希米勒的儿子祭司亚比亚他说：“请你将以弗得拿过来。”亚比亚他就将以弗得拿到大卫面前。
{1Sa 30:8}  And David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue after this band? Shall I overtake them?" He answered him, "Pursue, for you shall surely overtake and shall surely rescue."
{1Sa 30:8}  大卫求问耶和华说：“我追赶敌军，追得上追不上呢？”耶和华说：“你可以追，必追得上，都救得回来。”
{1Sa 30:9}  So David set out, and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.
{1Sa 30:9}  于是，大卫和跟随他的六百人来到比梭溪；有不能前去的就留在那里。
{1Sa 30:10} But David pursued, he and four hundred men. Two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor.
{1Sa 30:10} 大卫却带着四百人往前追赶，有二百人疲乏，不能过比梭溪，所以留在那里。
{1Sa 30:11} They found an Egyptian in the open country and brought him to David. And they gave him bread and he ate. They gave him water to drink,
{1Sa 30:11} 这四百人在田野遇见一个埃及人，就带他到大卫面前，给他饼吃，给他水喝，
{1Sa 30:12} and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit revived, for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.
{1Sa 30:12} 又给他一块无花果饼，两个葡萄饼。他吃了，就精神复原；因为他三日三夜没有吃饼，没有喝水。
{1Sa 30:13} And David said to him, "To whom do you belong? And where are you from?" He said, "I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite, and my master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago.
{1Sa 30:13} 大卫问他说：“你是属谁的？你是那里的人？”他回答说：“我是埃及的少年人，是亚玛力人的奴仆；因我三日前患病，我主人就把我撇弃了。
{1Sa 30:14} We had made a raid against the Negeb of the Cherethites and against that which belongs to Judah and against the Negeb of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire."
{1Sa 30:14} 我们侵夺了基利提的南方和属犹大的地，并迦勒地的南方，又用火烧了洗革拉。”
{1Sa 30:15} And David said to him, "Will you take me down to this band?" And he said, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this band."
{1Sa 30:15} 大卫问他说：“你肯领我们到敌军那里不肯？”他回答说：“你要向我指着神起誓，不杀我，也不将我交在我主人手里，我就领你下到敌军那里。”
{1Sa 30:16} And when he had taken him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
{1Sa 30:16} 那人领大卫下去，见他们散在地上，吃喝跳舞，因为从非利士地和犹大地所掳来的财物甚多。
{1Sa 30:17} And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day, and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who mounted camels and fled.
{1Sa 30:17} 大卫从黎明直到次日晚上，击杀他们，除了四百骑骆驼的少年人之外，没有一个逃脱的。
{1Sa 30:18} David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.
{1Sa 30:18} 亚玛力人所掳去的财物，大卫全都夺回，并救回他的两个妻来。
{1Sa 30:19} Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken. David brought back all.
{1Sa 30:19} 凡亚玛力人所掳去的，无论大小、儿女、财物，大卫都夺回来，没有失落一个。
{1Sa 30:20} David also captured all the flocks and herds, and the people drove the livestock before him, and said, "This is David's spoil."
{1Sa 30:20} 大卫所夺来的牛群羊群，跟随他的人赶在原有的群畜前边，说：“这是大卫的掠物。”
{1Sa 30:21} Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David, and who had been left at the brook Besor. And they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. And when David came near to the people he greeted them.
{1Sa 30:21} 大卫到了那疲乏不能跟随、留在比梭溪的二百人那里。他们出来迎接大卫并跟随的人。大卫前来问他们安。
{1Sa 30:22} Then all the wicked and worthless fellows among the men who had gone with David said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except that each man may lead away his wife and children, and depart."
{1Sa 30:22} 跟随大卫人中的恶人和匪类说：“这些人既然没有和我们同去，我们所夺的财物就不分给他们，只将他们各人的妻子儿女给他们，使他们带去就是了。”
{1Sa 30:23} But David said, "You shall not do so, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us. He has preserved us and given into our hand the band that came against us.
{1Sa 30:23} 大卫说：“弟兄们，耶和华所赐给我们的，不可不分给他们；因为他保佑我们，将那攻击我们的敌军交在我们手里。
{1Sa 30:24} Who would listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage. They shall share alike."
{1Sa 30:24} 这事谁肯依从你们呢？上阵的得多少，看守器具的也得多少；应当大家平分。”
{1Sa 30:25} And he made it a statute and a rule for Israel from that day forward to this day.
{1Sa 30:25} 大卫定此为以色列的律例典章，从那日直到今日。
{1Sa 30:26} When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, "Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD."
{1Sa 30:26} 大卫到了洗革拉，从掠物中取些送给他朋友犹大的长老，说：“这是从耶和华仇敌那里夺来的，送你们为礼物。”
{1Sa 30:27} It was for those in Bethel, in Ramoth of the Negeb, in Jattir,
{1Sa 30:27} 他送礼物给住伯特利的，南地拉末的，雅提珥的；
{1Sa 30:28} in Aroer, in Siphmoth, in Eshtemoa,
{1Sa 30:28} 住亚罗珥的，息末的，以实提莫的；
{1Sa 30:29} in Racal, in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, in the cities of the Kenites,
{1Sa 30:29} 住拉哈勒的，耶拉篾各城的，基尼各城的；
{1Sa 30:30} in Hormah, in Bor-ashan, in Athach,
{1Sa 30:30} 住何珥玛的，歌拉珊的，亚挞的；
{1Sa 30:31} in Hebron, for all the places where David and his men had roamed.
{1Sa 30:31} 住希伯仑的，并大卫和跟随他的人素来所到之处的人。
{1Sa 31:1}  Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
{1Sa 31:1}  非利士人与以色列人争战。以色列人在非利士人面前逃跑，在基利波有被杀仆倒的。
{1Sa 31:2}  And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
{1Sa 31:2}  非利士人紧追扫罗和他儿子们，就杀了扫罗的儿子约拿单、亚比拿达、麦基舒亚。
{1Sa 31:3}  The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was badly wounded by the archers.
{1Sa 31:3}  势派甚大，扫罗被弓箭手追上，射伤甚重，
{1Sa 31:4}  Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and mistreat me." But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
{1Sa 31:4}  就吩咐拿他兵器的人说：“你拔出刀来，将我刺死，免得那些未受割礼的人来刺我，凌辱我。”但拿兵器的人甚惧怕，不肯刺他；扫罗就自己伏在刀上死了。
{1Sa 31:5}  And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.
{1Sa 31:5}  拿兵器的人见扫罗已死，也伏在刀上死了。
{1Sa 31:6}  Thus Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men, on the same day together.
{1Sa 31:6}  这样，扫罗和他三个儿子，与拿他兵器的人，以及跟随他的人，都一同死亡。
{1Sa 31:7}  And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. And the Philistines came and lived in them.
{1Sa 31:7}  住平原那边并约但河西的以色列人，见以色列军兵逃跑，扫罗和他儿子都死了，也就弃城逃跑。非利士人便来住在其中。
{1Sa 31:8}  The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
{1Sa 31:8}  次日，非利士人来剥那被杀之人的衣服，看见扫罗和他三个儿子仆倒在基利波山，
{1Sa 31:9}  So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to the house of their idols and to the people.
{1Sa 31:9}  就割下他的首级，剥了他的军装，打发人到（或作：送到）非利士地的四境，报信与他们庙里的偶像和众民；
{1Sa 31:10} They put his armor in the temple of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
{1Sa 31:10} 又将扫罗的军装放在亚斯他录庙里，将他的尸身钉在伯珊的城墙上。
{1Sa 31:11} But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
{1Sa 31:11} 基列雅比的居民听见非利士人向扫罗所行的事，
{1Sa 31:12} all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Jabesh and burned them there.
{1Sa 31:12} 他们中间所有的勇士就起身，走了一夜，将扫罗和他儿子的尸身从伯珊城墙上取下来，送到雅比那里，用火烧了；
{1Sa 31:13} And they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
{1Sa 31:13} 将他们骸骨葬在雅比的垂丝柳树下，就禁食七日。
