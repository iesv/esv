{Eze 1:1}   In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the Chebar canal, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
{Eze 1:1}   当三十年四月初五日，以西结（原文作我）在迦巴鲁河边被掳的人中，天就开了，得见神的异象。
{Eze 1:2}   On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin),
{Eze 1:2}   正是约雅斤王被掳去第五年四月初五日，
{Eze 1:3}   the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Chebar canal, and the hand of the LORD was upon him there.
{Eze 1:3}   在迦勒底人之地、迦巴鲁河边，耶和华的话特特临到布西的儿子祭司以西结；耶和华的灵（原文作手）降在他身上。
{Eze 1:4}   As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming metal.
{Eze 1:4}   我观看，见狂风从北方刮来，随着有一朵包括闪烁火的大云，周围有光辉；从其中的火内发出好像光耀的精金；
{Eze 1:5}   And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness,
{Eze 1:5}   又从其中显出四个活物的形像来。他们的形状是这样：有人的形像，
{Eze 1:6}   but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.
{Eze 1:6}   各有四个脸面，四个翅膀。
{Eze 1:7}   Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled like burnished bronze.
{Eze 1:7}   他们的腿是直的，脚掌好像牛犊之蹄，都灿烂如光明的铜。
{Eze 1:8}   Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:
{Eze 1:8}   在四面的翅膀以下有人的手。这四个活物的脸和翅膀乃是这样：
{Eze 1:9}   their wings touched one another. Each one of them went straight forward, without turning as they went.
{Eze 1:9}   翅膀彼此相接，行走并不转身，俱各直往前行。
{Eze 1:10}  As for the likeness of their faces, each had a human face. The four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle.
{Eze 1:10}  至于脸的形像：前面各有人的脸，右面各有狮子的脸，左面各有牛的脸，后面各有鹰的脸。
{Eze 1:11}  Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies.
{Eze 1:11}  各展开上边的两个翅膀相接，各以下边的两个翅膀遮体。
{Eze 1:12}  And each went straight forward. Wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went.
{Eze 1:12}  他们俱各直往前行。灵往那里去，他们就往那里去，行走并不转身。
{Eze 1:13}  As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures. And the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
{Eze 1:13}  至于四活物的形像，就如烧着火炭的形状，又如火把的形状。火在四活物中间上去下来，这火有光辉，从火中发出闪电。
{Eze 1:14}  And the living creatures darted to and fro, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.
{Eze 1:14}  这活物往来奔走，好像电光一闪。
{Eze 1:15}  Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.
{Eze 1:15}  我正观看活物的时候，见活物的脸旁各有一轮在地上。
{Eze 1:16}  As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl. And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel.
{Eze 1:16}  轮的形状和颜色（原文作作法）好像水苍玉。四轮都是一个样式，形状和作法好像轮中套轮。
{Eze 1:17}  When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went.
{Eze 1:17}  轮行走的时候，向四方都能直行，并不掉转。
{Eze 1:18}  And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
{Eze 1:18}  至于轮辋，高而可畏；四个轮辋周围满有眼睛。
{Eze 1:19}  And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.
{Eze 1:19}  活物行走，轮也在旁边行走；活物从地上升，轮也都上升。
{Eze 1:20}  Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
{Eze 1:20}  灵往那里去，活物就往那里去；活物上升，轮也在活物旁边上升，因为活物的灵在轮中。
{Eze 1:21}  When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
{Eze 1:21}  那些行走，这些也行走；那些站住，这些也站住；那些从地上升，轮也在旁边上升，因为活物的灵在轮中。
{Eze 1:22}  Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of an expanse, shining like awe-inspiring crystal, spread out above their heads.
{Eze 1:22}  活物的头以上有穹苍的形像，看着像可畏的水晶，铺张在活物的头以上。
{Eze 1:23}  And under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another. And each creature had two wings covering its body.
{Eze 1:23}  穹苍以下，活物的翅膀直张，彼此相对；每活物有两个翅膀遮体。
{Eze 1:24}  And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
{Eze 1:24}  活物行走的时候，我听见翅膀的响声，像大水的声音，像全能者的声音，也像军队哄嚷的声音。活物站住的时候，便将翅膀垂下。
{Eze 1:25}  And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
{Eze 1:25}  在他们头以上的穹苍之上有声音。他们站住的时候，便将翅膀垂下。
{Eze 1:26}  And above the expanse over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness with a human appearance.
{Eze 1:26}  在他们头以上的穹苍之上有宝座的形像，彷佛蓝宝石；在宝座形像以上有彷佛人的形状。
{Eze 1:27}  And upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him.
{Eze 1:27}  我见从他腰以上有彷佛光耀的精金，周围都有火的形状，又见从他腰以下有彷佛火的形状，周围也有光辉。
{Eze 1:28}  Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.
{Eze 1:28}  下雨的日子，云中虹的形状怎样，周围光辉的形状也是怎样。这就是耶和华荣耀的形像。我一看见就俯伏在地，又听见一位说话的声音。
{Eze 2:1}   And he said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you."
{Eze 2:1}   他对我说：“人子啊，你站起来，我要和你说话。”
{Eze 2:2}   And as he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.
{Eze 2:2}   他对我说话的时候，灵就进入我里面，使我站起来，我便听见那位对我说话的声音。
{Eze 2:3}   And he said to me, "Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day.
{Eze 2:3}   他对我说：“人子啊，我差你往悖逆的国民以色列人那里去。他们是悖逆我的，他们和他们的列祖违背我，直到今日。
{Eze 2:4}   The descendants also are impudent and stubborn: I send you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.'
{Eze 2:4}   这众子面无羞耻，心里刚硬。我差你往他们那里去，你要对他们说：主耶和华如此说。
{Eze 2:5}   And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that a prophet has been among them.
{Eze 2:5}   他们或听，或不听，（他们是悖逆之家），必知道在他们中间有了先知。
{Eze 2:6}   And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions. Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
{Eze 2:6}   人子啊，虽有荆棘和蒺藜在你那里，你又住在蝎子中间，总不要怕他们，也不要怕他们的话；他们虽是悖逆之家，还不要怕他们的话，也不要因他们的脸色惊惶。
{Eze 2:7}   And you shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house.
{Eze 2:7}   他们或听，或不听，你只管将我的话告诉他们；他们是极其悖逆的。
{Eze 2:8}   "But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you."
{Eze 2:8}   “人子啊，要听我对你所说的话，不要悖逆像那悖逆之家，你要开口吃我所赐给你的。”
{Eze 2:9}   And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it.
{Eze 2:9}   我观看，见有一只手向我伸出来，手中有一书卷。
{Eze 2:10}  And he spread it before me. And it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.
{Eze 2:10}  他将书卷在我面前展开，内外都写着字，其上所写的有哀号、叹息、悲痛的话。
{Eze 3:1}   And he said to me, "Son of man, eat whatever you find here. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel."
{Eze 3:1}   他对我说：“人子啊，要吃你所得的，要吃这书卷，好去对以色列家讲说。”
{Eze 3:2}   So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat.
{Eze 3:2}   于是我开口，他就使我吃这书卷，
{Eze 3:3}   And he said to me, "Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it." Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.
{Eze 3:3}   又对我说：“人子啊，要吃我所赐给你的这书卷，充满你的肚腹。”我就吃了，口中觉得其甜如蜜。
{Eze 3:4}   And he said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them.
{Eze 3:4}   他对我说：“人子啊，你往以色列家那里去，将我的话对他们讲说。
{Eze 3:5}   For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel--
{Eze 3:5}   你奉差遣不是往那说话深奥、言语难懂的民那里去，乃是往以色列家去；
{Eze 3:6}   not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you.
{Eze 3:6}   不是往那说话深奥、言语难懂的多国去，他们的话语是你不懂得的。我若差你往他们那里去，他们必听从你。
{Eze 3:7}   But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart.
{Eze 3:7}   以色列家却不肯听从你，因为他们不肯听从我；原来以色列全家是额坚心硬的人。
{Eze 3:8}   Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
{Eze 3:8}   看哪，我使你的脸硬过他们的脸，使你的额硬过他们的额。
{Eze 3:9}   Like emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house."
{Eze 3:9}   我使你的额像金钢钻，比火石更硬。他们虽是悖逆之家，你不要怕他们，也不要因他们的脸色惊惶。”
{Eze 3:10}  Moreover, he said to me, "Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.
{Eze 3:10}  他又对我说：“人子啊，我对你所说的一切话，要心里领会，耳中听闻。
{Eze 3:11}  And go to the exiles, to your people, and speak to them and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD,' whether they hear or refuse to hear."
{Eze 3:11}  你往你本国被掳的子民那里去，他们或听，或不听，你要对他们讲说，告诉他们这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 3:12}  Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great earthquake: "Blessed be the glory of the LORD from its place!"
{Eze 3:12}  那时，灵将我举起，我就听见在我身后有震动轰轰的声音，说：“从耶和华的所在显出来的荣耀是该称颂的！”
{Eze 3:13}  It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great earthquake.
{Eze 3:13}  我又听见那活物翅膀相碰，与活物旁边轮子旋转震动轰轰的响声。
{Eze 3:14}  The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the LORD being strong upon me.
{Eze 3:14}  于是灵将我举起，带我而去。我心中甚苦，灵性忿激，并且耶和华的灵（原文作手）在我身上大有能力。
{Eze 3:15}  And I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were dwelling by the Chebar canal, and I sat where they were dwelling. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.
{Eze 3:15}  我就来到提勒亚毕，住在迦巴鲁河边被掳的人那里，到他们所住的地方，在他们中间忧忧闷闷地坐了七日。
{Eze 3:16}  And at the end of seven days, the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 3:16}  过了七日，耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 3:17}  "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.
{Eze 3:17}  “人子啊，我立你作以色列家守望的人，所以你要听我口中的话，替我警戒他们。
{Eze 3:18}  If I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked person shall die for his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
{Eze 3:18}  我何时指着恶人说：他必要死；你若不警戒他，也不劝戒他，使他离开恶行，拯救他的性命，这恶人必死在罪孽之中；我却要向你讨他丧命的罪（原文作血）。
{Eze 3:19}  But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.
{Eze 3:19}  倘若你警戒恶人，他仍不转离罪恶，也不离开恶行，他必死在罪孽之中，你却救自己脱离了罪。
{Eze 3:20}  Again, if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds that he has done shall not be remembered, but his blood I will require at your hand.
{Eze 3:20}  再者，义人何时离义而犯罪，我将绊脚石放在他面前，他就必死；因你没有警戒他，他必死在罪中，他素来所行的义不被记念；我却要向你讨他丧命的罪（原文作血）。
{Eze 3:21}  But if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and you will have delivered your soul."
{Eze 3:21}  倘若你警戒义人，使他不犯罪，他就不犯罪；他因受警戒就必存活，你也救自己脱离了罪。”
{Eze 3:22}  And the hand of the LORD was upon me there. And he said to me, "Arise, go out into the valley, and there I will speak with you."
{Eze 3:22}  耶和华的灵（原文作手）在那里降在我身上。他对我说：“你起来往平原去，我要在那里和你说话。”
{Eze 3:23}  So I arose and went out into the valley, and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory that I had seen by the Chebar canal, and I fell on my face.
{Eze 3:23}  于是我起来往平原去，不料，耶和华的荣耀正如我在迦巴鲁河边所见的一样，停在那里，我就俯伏于地。
{Eze 3:24}  But the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, "Go, shut yourself within your house.
{Eze 3:24}  灵就进入我里面，使我站起来。耶和华对我说：“你进房屋去，将门关上。
{Eze 3:25}  And you, O son of man, behold, cords will be placed upon you, and you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people.
{Eze 3:25}  人子啊，人必用绳索捆绑你，你就不能出去在他们中间来往。
{Eze 3:26}  And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and unable to reprove them, for they are a rebellious house.
{Eze 3:26}  我必使你的舌头贴住上膛，以致你哑口，不能作责备他们的人；他们原是悖逆之家。
{Eze 3:27}  But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.' He who will hear, let him hear; and he who will refuse to hear, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house.
{Eze 3:27}  但我对你说话的时候，必使你开口，你就要对他们说：‘主耶和华如此说。’听的可以听，不听的任他不听，因为他们是悖逆之家。”
{Eze 4:1}   "And you, son of man, take a brick and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, even Jerusalem.
{Eze 4:1}   “人子啊，你要拿一块砖，摆在你面前，将一座耶路撒冷城画在其上，
{Eze 4:2}   And put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it. Set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it all around.
{Eze 4:2}   又围困这城，造台筑垒，安营攻击，在四围安设撞锤攻城，
{Eze 4:3}   And you, take an iron griddle, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; and set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel.
{Eze 4:3}   又要拿个铁鏊，放在你和城的中间，作为铁墙。你要对面攻击这城，使城被困；这样，好作以色列家的预兆。
{Eze 4:4}   "Then lie on your left side, and place the punishment of the house of Israel upon it. For the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their punishment.
{Eze 4:4}   “你要向左侧卧，承当以色列家的罪孽；要按你向左侧卧的日数，担当他们的罪孽。
{Eze 4:5}   For I assign to you a number of days, 390 days, equal to the number of the years of their punishment. So long shall you bear the punishment of the house of Israel.
{Eze 4:5}   因为我已将他们作孽的年数定为你向左侧卧的日数，就是三百九十日，你要这样担当以色列家的罪孽。
{Eze 4:6}   And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah. Forty days I assign you, a day for each year.
{Eze 4:6}   再者，你满了这些日子，还要向右侧卧，担当犹大家的罪孽。我给你定规侧卧四十日，一日顶一年。
{Eze 4:7}   And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against the city.
{Eze 4:7}   你要露出膀臂，面向被困的耶路撒冷，说预言攻击这城。
{Eze 4:8}   And behold, I will place cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed the days of your siege.
{Eze 4:8}   我用绳索捆绑你，使你不能辗转，直等你满了困城的日子。
{Eze 4:9}   "And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and emmer, and put them into a single vessel and make your bread from them. During the number of days that you lie on your side, 390 days, you shall eat it.
{Eze 4:9}   “你要取小麦、大麦、豆子、红豆、小米、粗麦，装在一个器皿中，用以为自己做饼；要按你侧卧的三百九十日吃这饼。
{Eze 4:10}  And your food that you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from day to day you shall eat it.
{Eze 4:10}  你所吃的要按分两吃，每日二十舍客勒，按时而吃。
{Eze 4:11}  And water you shall drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from day to day you shall drink.
{Eze 4:11}  你喝水也要按制子，每日喝一欣六分之一，按时而喝。
{Eze 4:12}  And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it in their sight on human dung."
{Eze 4:12}  你吃这饼像吃大麦饼一样，要用人粪在众人眼前烧烤。”
{Eze 4:13}  And the LORD said, "Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them."
{Eze 4:13}  耶和华说：“以色列人在我所赶他们到的各国中，也必这样吃不洁净的食物。”
{Eze 4:14}  Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I have never defiled myself. From my youth up till now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has tainted meat come into my mouth."
{Eze 4:14}  我说：“哎！主耶和华啊，我素来未曾被玷污，从幼年到如今没有吃过自死的，或被野兽撕裂的，那可憎的肉也未曾入我的口。”
{Eze 4:15}  Then he said to me, "See, I assign to you cow's dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread."
{Eze 4:15}  于是他对我说：“看哪，我给你牛粪代替人粪，你要将你的饼烤在其上。”
{Eze 4:16}  Moreover, he said to me, "Son of man, behold, I will break the supply of bread in Jerusalem. They shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and they shall drink water by measure and in dismay.
{Eze 4:16}  他又对我说：“人子啊，我必在耶路撒冷折断他们的杖，就是断绝他们的粮。他们吃饼要按分两，忧虑而吃；喝水也要按制子，惊惶而喝；
{Eze 4:17}  I will do this that they may lack bread and water, and look at one another in dismay, and rot away because of their punishment.
{Eze 4:17}  使他们缺粮缺水，彼此惊惶，因自己的罪孽消灭。”
{Eze 5:1}   "And you, O son of man, take a sharp sword. Use it as a barber's razor and pass it over your head and your beard. Then take balances for weighing and divide the hair.
{Eze 5:1}   “人子啊，你要拿一把快刀，当作剃头刀，用这刀剃你的头发和你的胡须，用天平将须发平分。
{Eze 5:2}   A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. And a third part you shall take and strike with the sword all around the city. And a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.
{Eze 5:2}   围困城的日子满了，你要将三分之一在城中用火焚烧，将三分之一在城的四围用刀砍碎，将三分之一任风吹散；我也要拔刀追赶。
{Eze 5:3}   And you shall take from these a small number and bind them in the skirts of your robe.
{Eze 5:3}   你要从其中取几根包在衣襟里，
{Eze 5:4}   And of these again you shall take some and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.
{Eze 5:4}   再从这几根中取些扔在火中焚烧，从里面必有火出来烧入以色列全家。
{Eze 5:5}   "Thus says the Lord GOD: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the center of the nations, with countries all around her.
{Eze 5:5}   主耶和华如此说：这就是耶路撒冷。我曾将他安置在列邦之中；列国都在他的四围。
{Eze 5:6}   And she has rebelled against my rules by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries all around her; for they have rejected my rules and have not walked in my statutes.
{Eze 5:6}   他行恶，违背我的典章，过于列国；干犯我的律例，过于四围的列邦，因为他弃掉我的典章。至于我的律例，他并没有遵行。
{Eze 5:7}   Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are all around you, and have not walked in my statutes or obeyed my rules, and have not even acted according to the rules of the nations that are all around you,
{Eze 5:7}   所以主耶和华如此说：因为你们分争过于四围的列国，也不遵行我的律例，不谨守我的典章，并以遵从四围列国的恶规尚不满意，
{Eze 5:8}   therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, even I, am against you. And I will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations.
{Eze 5:8}   所以主耶和华如此说：看哪，我与你反对，必在列国的眼前，在你中间，施行审判；
{Eze 5:9}   And because of all your abominations I will do with you what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again.
{Eze 5:9}   并且因你一切可憎的事，我要在你中间行我所未曾行的，以后我也不再照着行。
{Eze 5:10}  Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments on you, and any of you who survive I will scatter to all the winds.
{Eze 5:10}  在你中间父亲要吃儿子，儿子要吃父亲。我必向你施行审判，我必将你所剩下的分散四方（方：原文作风）。”
{Eze 5:11}  Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will withdraw. My eye will not spare, and I will have no pity.
{Eze 5:11}  主耶和华说：“我指着我的永生起誓，因你用一切可憎的物、可厌的事玷污了我的圣所，故此，我定要使你人数减少，我眼必不顾惜你，也不可怜你。
{Eze 5:12}  A third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed with famine in your midst; a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds and will unsheathe the sword after them.
{Eze 5:12}  你的民三分之一必遭瘟疫而死，在你中间必因饥荒消灭；三分之一必在你四围倒在刀下；我必将三分之一分散四方（方：原文作风），并要拔刀追赶他们。
{Eze 5:13}  "Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself. And they shall know that I am the LORD--that I have spoken in my jealousy--when I spend my fury upon them.
{Eze 5:13}  “我要这样成就怒中所定的；我向他们发的忿怒止息了，自己就得着安慰。我在他们身上成就怒中所定的那时，他们就知道我耶和华所说的是出于热心；
{Eze 5:14}  Moreover, I will make you a desolation and an object of reproach among the nations all around you and in the sight of all who pass by.
{Eze 5:14}  并且我必使你在四围的列国中，在经过的众人眼前，成了荒凉和羞辱。
{Eze 5:15}  You shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations all around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious rebukes--I am the LORD; I have spoken--
{Eze 5:15}  这样，我必以怒气和忿怒，并烈怒的责备，向你施行审判。那时，你就在四围的列国中成为羞辱、讥刺、警戒、惊骇。这是我耶和华说的。
{Eze 5:16}  when I send against you the deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon you and break your supply of bread.
{Eze 5:16}  那时，我要将灭人、使人饥荒的恶箭，就是射去灭人的，射在你们身上，并要加增你们的饥荒，断绝你们所倚靠的粮食；
{Eze 5:17}  I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the LORD; I have spoken."
{Eze 5:17}  又要使饥荒和恶兽到你那里，叫你丧子，瘟疫和流血的事也必盛行在你那里；我也要使刀剑临到你。这是我耶和华说的。”
{Eze 6:1}   The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 6:1}   耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 6:2}   "Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
{Eze 6:2}   “人子啊，你要面向以色列的众山说预言，
{Eze 6:3}   and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
{Eze 6:3}   说：以色列的众山哪，要听主耶和华的话。主耶和华对大山、小冈、水沟、山谷如此说：我必使刀剑临到你们，也必毁灭你们的邱坛。
{Eze 6:4}   Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
{Eze 6:4}   你们的祭坛必然荒凉，你们的日像必被打碎。我要使你们被杀的人倒在你们的偶像面前；
{Eze 6:5}   And I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
{Eze 6:5}   我也要将以色列人的尸首放在他们的偶像面前，将你们的骸骨抛散在你们祭坛的四围。
{Eze 6:6}   Wherever you dwell, the cities shall be waste and the high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined, your idols broken and destroyed, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out.
{Eze 6:6}   在你们一切的住处，城邑要变为荒场，邱坛必然凄凉，使你们的祭坛荒废，将你们的偶像打碎。你们的日像被砍倒，你们的工作被毁灭。
{Eze 6:7}   And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 6:7}   被杀的人必倒在你们中间，你们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 6:8}   "Yet I will leave some of you alive. When you have among the nations some who escape the sword, and when you are scattered through the countries,
{Eze 6:8}   “你们分散在各国的时候，我必在列邦中使你们有剩下脱离刀剑的人。
{Eze 6:9}   then those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken over their whoring heart that has departed from me and over their eyes that go whoring after their idols. And they will be loathsome in their own sight for the evils that they have committed, for all their abominations.
{Eze 6:9}   那脱离刀剑的人必在所掳到的各国中记念我，为他们心中何等伤破，是因他们起淫心，远离我，眼对偶像行邪淫。他们因行一切可憎的恶事，必厌恶自己。
{Eze 6:10}  And they shall know that I am the LORD. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them."
{Eze 6:10}  他们必知道我是耶和华；我说要使这灾祸临到他们身上，并非空话。
{Eze 6:11}  Thus says the Lord GOD: "Clap your hands and stamp your foot and say, Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.
{Eze 6:11}  “主耶和华如此说：你当拍手顿足，说：哀哉！以色列家行这一切可憎的恶事，他们必倒在刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫之下。
{Eze 6:12}  He who is far off shall die of pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who is left and is preserved shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them.
{Eze 6:12}  在远处的，必遭瘟疫而死；在近处的，必倒在刀剑之下；那存留被围困的，必因饥荒而死；我必这样在他们身上成就我怒中所定的。
{Eze 6:13}  And you shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, wherever they offered pleasing aroma to all their idols.
{Eze 6:13}  他们被杀的人倒在他们祭坛四围的偶像中，就是各高冈、各山顶、各青翠树下、各茂密的橡树下，乃是他们献馨香的祭牲给一切偶像的地方。那时，他们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 6:14}  And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate and waste, in all their dwelling places, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
{Eze 6:14}  我必伸手攻击他们，使他们的地从旷野到第伯拉他一切住处极其荒凉，他们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 7:1}   The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 7:1}   耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 7:2}   "And you, O son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
{Eze 7:2}   “人子啊，主耶和华对以色列地如此说：结局到了，结局到了地的四境！
{Eze 7:3}   Now the end is upon you, and I will send my anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations.
{Eze 7:3}   现在你的结局已经临到，我必使我的怒气归与你，也必按你的行为审判你，照你一切可憎的事刑罚你。
{Eze 7:4}   And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity, but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 7:4}   我眼必不顾惜你，也不可怜你，却要按你所行的报应你，照你中间可憎的事刑罚你。你就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 7:5}   "Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster after disaster! Behold, it comes.
{Eze 7:5}   “主耶和华如此说：有一灾，独有一灾；看哪，临近了！
{Eze 7:6}   An end has come; the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes.
{Eze 7:6}   结局来了，结局来了，向你兴起。看哪，来到了！
{Eze 7:7}   Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come; the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting on the mountains.
{Eze 7:7}   境内的居民哪，所定的灾临到你，时候到了，日子近了，乃是哄嚷并非在山上欢呼的日子。
{Eze 7:8}   Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations.
{Eze 7:8}   我快要将我的忿怒倾在你身上，向你成就我怒中所定的，按你的行为审判你，照你一切可憎的事刑罚你。
{Eze 7:9}   And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD, who strikes.
{Eze 7:9}   我眼必不顾惜你，也不可怜你，必按你所行的报应你，照你中间可憎的事刑罚你。你就知道击打你的是我耶和华。
{Eze 7:10}  "Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has come; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded.
{Eze 7:10}  “看哪，看哪，日子快到了，所定的灾已经发出。杖已经开花，骄傲已经发芽。
{Eze 7:11}  Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them.
{Eze 7:11}  强暴兴起，成了罚恶的杖。以色列人，或是他们的群众，或是他们的财宝，无一存留，他们中间也没有得尊荣的。
{Eze 7:12}  The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.
{Eze 7:12}  时候到了，日子近了，买主不可欢喜，卖主不可愁烦，因为烈怒已经临到他们众人身上。
{Eze 7:13}  For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life.
{Eze 7:13}  卖主虽然存活，却不能归回再得所卖的，因为这异象关乎他们众人。谁都不得归回，也没有人在他的罪孽中坚立自己。”
{Eze 7:14}  "They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but none goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude.
{Eze 7:14}  “他们已经吹角，预备齐全，却无一人出战，因为我的烈怒临到他们众人身上。
{Eze 7:15}  The sword is without; pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field dies by the sword, and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour.
{Eze 7:15}  在外有刀剑，在内有瘟疫、饥荒；在田野的，必遭刀剑而死；在城中的，必有饥荒、瘟疫吞灭他。
{Eze 7:16}  And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity.
{Eze 7:16}  其中所逃脱的就必逃脱，各人因自己的罪孽在山上发出悲声，好像谷中的鸽子哀鸣。
{Eze 7:17}  All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water.
{Eze 7:17}  手都发软，膝弱如水。
{Eze 7:18}  They put on sackcloth, and horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.
{Eze 7:18}  要用麻布束腰，被战兢所盖；各人脸上羞愧，头上光秃。
{Eze 7:19}  They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing. Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity.
{Eze 7:19}  他们要将银子抛在街上，金子看如污秽之物。当耶和华发怒的日子，他们的金银不能救他们，不能使心里知足，也不能使肚腹饱满，因为这金银作了他们罪孽的绊脚石。
{Eze 7:20}  His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it. Therefore I make it an unclean thing to them.
{Eze 7:20}  论到耶和华妆饰华美的殿，他建立得威严，他们却在其中制造可憎可厌的偶像，所以这殿我使他们看如污秽之物。
{Eze 7:21}  And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for prey, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, and they shall profane it.
{Eze 7:21}  我必将这殿交付外邦人为掠物，交付地上的恶人为掳物；他们也必亵渎这殿。
{Eze 7:22}  I will turn my face from them, and they shall profane my treasured place. Robbers shall enter and profane it.
{Eze 7:22}  我必转脸不顾以色列人，他们亵渎我隐密之所，强盗也必进去亵渎。
{Eze 7:23}  "Forge a chain! For the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence.
{Eze 7:23}  “要制造锁链；因为这地遍满流血的罪，城邑充满强暴的事，
{Eze 7:24}  I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned.
{Eze 7:24}  所以我必使列国中最恶的人来占据他们的房屋；我必使强暴人的骄傲止息，他们的圣所都要被亵渎。
{Eze 7:25}  When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none.
{Eze 7:25}  毁灭临近了，他们要求平安，却无平安可得。
{Eze 7:26}  Disaster comes upon disaster; rumor follows rumor. They seek a vision from the prophet, while the law perishes from the priest and counsel from the elders.
{Eze 7:26}  灾害加上灾害，风声接连风声；他们必向先知求异象，但祭司讲的律法、长老设的谋略都必断绝。
{Eze 7:27}  The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, and they shall know that I am the LORD."
{Eze 7:27}  君要悲哀，王要披凄凉为衣，国民的手都发颤。我必照他们的行为待他们，按他们应得的审判他们，他们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 8:1}   In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there.
{Eze 8:1}   第六年六月初五日，我坐在家中；犹大的众长老坐在我面前。在那里主耶和华的灵（原文作手）降在我身上。
{Eze 8:2}   Then I looked, and behold, a form that had the appearance of a man. Below what appeared to be his waist was fire, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming metal.
{Eze 8:2}   我观看，见有形像彷佛火的形状，从他腰以下的形状有火，从他腰以上有光辉的形状，彷佛光耀的精金。
{Eze 8:3}   He put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.
{Eze 8:3}   他伸出彷佛一只手的样式，抓住我的一绺头发，灵就将我举到天地中间，在神的异象中，带我到耶路撒冷朝北的内院门口，在那里有触动主怒偶像的坐位，就是惹动忌邪的。
{Eze 8:4}   And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the valley.
{Eze 8:4}   谁知，在那里有以色列神的荣耀，形状与我在平原所见的一样。
{Eze 8:5}   Then he said to me, "Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north." So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy.
{Eze 8:5}   神对我说：“人子啊，你举目向北观看。”我就举目向北观看，见祭坛门的北边，在门口有这惹忌邪的偶像；
{Eze 8:6}   And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations."
{Eze 8:6}   又对我说：“人子啊，以色列家所行的，就是在此行这大可憎的事，使我远离我的圣所，你看见了吗？你还要看见另有大可憎的事。”
{Eze 8:7}   And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall.
{Eze 8:7}   他领我到院门口。我观看，见墙上有个窟窿。
{Eze 8:8}   Then he said to me, "Son of man, dig in the wall." So I dug in the wall, and behold, there was an entrance.
{Eze 8:8}   他对我说：“人子啊，你要挖墙。”我一挖墙，见有一门。
{Eze 8:9}   And he said to me, "Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here."
{Eze 8:9}   他说：“你进去，看他们在这里所行可憎的恶事。”
{Eze 8:10}  So I went in and saw. And there, engraved on the wall all around, was every form of creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel.
{Eze 8:10}  我进去一看，谁知，在四面墙上画着各样爬物和可憎的走兽，并以色列家一切的偶像。
{Eze 8:11}  And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up.
{Eze 8:11}  在这些像前有以色列家的七十个长老站立，沙番的儿子雅撒尼亚也站在其中。各人手拿香炉，烟云的香气上腾。
{Eze 8:12}  Then he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in his room of pictures? For they say, 'The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.'"
{Eze 8:12}  他对我说：“人子啊，以色列家的长老暗中在各人画像屋里所行的，你看见了吗？他们常说：‘耶和华看不见我们；耶和华已经离弃这地。’”
{Eze 8:13}  He said also to me, "You will see still greater abominations that they commit."
{Eze 8:13}  他又说：“你还要看见他们另外行大可憎的事。”
{Eze 8:14}  Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
{Eze 8:14}  他领我到耶和华殿外院朝北的门口。谁知，在那里有妇女坐着，为搭模斯哭泣。
{Eze 8:15}  Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these."
{Eze 8:15}  他对我说：“人子啊，你看见了吗？你还要看见比这更可憎的事。”
{Eze 8:16}  And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east.
{Eze 8:16}  他又领我到耶和华殿的内院。谁知，在耶和华的殿门口、廊子和祭坛中间，约有二十五个人背向耶和华的殿，面向东方拜日头。
{Eze 8:17}  Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence and provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their nose.
{Eze 8:17}  他对我说：“人子啊，你看见了吗？犹大家在此行这可憎的事还算为小吗？他们在这地遍行强暴，再三惹我发怒，他们手拿枝条举向鼻前。
{Eze 8:18}  Therefore I will act in wrath. My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them."
{Eze 8:18}  因此，我也要以忿怒行事，我眼必不顾惜，也不可怜他们；他们虽向我耳中大声呼求，我还是不听。”
{Eze 9:1}   Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, "Bring near the executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand."
{Eze 9:1}   他向我耳中大声喊叫说：“要使那监管这城的人手中各拿灭命的兵器前来。”
{Eze 9:2}   And behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
{Eze 9:2}   忽然有六个人从朝北的上门而来，各人手拿杀人的兵器；内中有一人身穿细麻衣，腰间带着墨盒子。他们进来，站在铜祭坛旁。
{Eze 9:3}   Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his waist.
{Eze 9:3}   以色列神的荣耀本在基路伯上，现今从那里升到殿的门槛。神将那身穿细麻衣、腰间带着墨盒子的人召来。
{Eze 9:4}   And the LORD said to him, "Pass through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it."
{Eze 9:4}   耶和华对他说：“你去走遍耶路撒冷全城，那些因城中所行可憎之事叹息哀哭的人，画记号在额上。”
{Eze 9:5}   And to the others he said in my hearing, "Pass through the city after him, and strike. Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity.
{Eze 9:5}   我耳中听见他对其余的人说：“要跟随他走遍全城，以行击杀。你们的眼不要顾惜，也不要可怜他们。
{Eze 9:6}   Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one on whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were before the house.
{Eze 9:6}   要将年老的、年少的，并处女、婴孩，和妇女，从圣所起全都杀尽，只是凡有记号的人不要挨近他。”于是他们从殿前的长老杀起。
{Eze 9:7}   Then he said to them, "Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out." So they went out and struck in the city.
{Eze 9:7}   他对他们说：“要污秽这殿，使院中充满被杀的人。你们出去吧！”他们就出去，在城中击杀。
{Eze 9:8}   And while they were striking, and I was left alone, I fell upon my face, and cried, "Ah, Lord GOD! Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?"
{Eze 9:8}   他们击杀的时候，我被留下，我就俯伏在地，说：“哎！主耶和华啊，你将忿怒倾在耶路撒冷，岂要将以色列所剩下的人都灭绝吗？”
{Eze 9:9}   Then he said to me, "The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice. For they say, 'The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see.'
{Eze 9:9}   他对我说：“以色列家和犹大家的罪孽极其重大。遍地有流血的事，满城有冤屈，因为他们说：‘耶和华已经离弃这地，他看不见我们。’
{Eze 9:10}  As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will bring their deeds upon their heads."
{Eze 9:10}  故此，我眼必不顾惜，也不可怜他们，要照他们所行的报应在他们头上。”
{Eze 9:11}  And behold, the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his waist, brought back word, saying, "I have done as you commanded me."
{Eze 9:11}  那穿细麻衣、腰间带着墨盒子的人将这事回覆说：“我已经照你所吩咐的行了。”
{Eze 10:1}  Then I looked, and behold, on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in appearance like a throne.
{Eze 10:1}  我观看，见基路伯头上的穹苍之中，显出蓝宝石的形状，彷佛宝座的形像。
{Eze 10:2}  And he said to the man clothed in linen, "Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city." And he went in before my eyes.
{Eze 10:2}  主对那穿细麻衣的人说：“你进去，在旋转的轮内基路伯以下，从基路伯中间将火炭取满两手，撒在城上。”我就见他进去。
{Eze 10:3}  Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.
{Eze 10:3}  那人进去的时候，基路伯站在殿的右边，云彩充满了内院。
{Eze 10:4}  And the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD.
{Eze 10:4}  耶和华的荣耀从基路伯那里上升，停在门槛以上；殿内满了云彩，院宇也被耶和华荣耀的光辉充满。
{Eze 10:5}  And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
{Eze 10:5}  基路伯翅膀的响声听到外院，好像全能神说话的声音。
{Eze 10:6}  And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, "Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim," he went in and stood beside a wheel.
{Eze 10:6}  他吩咐那穿细麻衣的人说：“要从旋转的轮内基路伯中间取火。”那人就进去站在一个轮子旁边。
{Eze 10:7}  And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
{Eze 10:7}  有一个基路伯从基路伯中伸手到基路伯中间的火那里，取些放在那穿细麻衣的人两手中，那人就拿出去了。
{Eze 10:8}  The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.
{Eze 10:8}  在基路伯翅膀之下，显出有人手的样式。
{Eze 10:9}  And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub, and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling beryl.
{Eze 10:9}  我又观看，见基路伯旁边有四个轮子。这基路伯旁有一个轮子，那基路伯旁有一个轮子，每基路伯都是如此；轮子的颜色（原文作形状）彷佛水苍玉。
{Eze 10:10} And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel.
{Eze 10:10} 至于四轮的形状，都是一个样式，彷佛轮中套轮。
{Eze 10:11} When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went, but in whatever direction the front wheel faced, the others followed without turning as they went.
{Eze 10:11} 轮行走的时候，向四方都能直行，并不掉转。头向何方，他们也随向何方，行走的时候并不掉转。
{Eze 10:12} And their whole body, their rims, and their spokes, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around--the wheels that the four of them had.
{Eze 10:12} 他们全身，连背带手和翅膀，并轮周围都满了眼睛。这四个基路伯的轮子都是如此。
{Eze 10:13} As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing "the whirling wheels."
{Eze 10:13} 至于这些轮子，我耳中听见说是旋转的。
{Eze 10:14} And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was a human face, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
{Eze 10:14} 基路伯各有四脸：第一是基路伯的脸，第二是人的脸，第三是狮子的脸，第四是鹰的脸。
{Eze 10:15} And the cherubim mounted up. These were the living creatures that I saw by the Chebar canal.
{Eze 10:15} 基路伯升上去了；这是我在迦巴鲁河边所见的活物。
{Eze 10:16} And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them. And when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them.
{Eze 10:16} 基路伯行走，轮也在旁边行走。基路伯展开翅膀，离地上升，轮也不转离他们旁边。
{Eze 10:17} When they stood still, these stood still, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
{Eze 10:17} 那些站住，这些也站住；那些上升，这些也一同上升，因为活物的灵在轮中。
{Eze 10:18} Then the glory of the LORD went out from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
{Eze 10:18} 耶和华的荣耀从殿的门槛那里出去，停在基路伯以上。
{Eze 10:19} And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes as they went out, with the wheels beside them. And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
{Eze 10:19} 基路伯出去的时候，就展开翅膀，在我眼前离地上升。轮也在他们的旁边，都停在耶和华殿的东门口。在他们以上有以色列神的荣耀。
{Eze 10:20} These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the Chebar canal; and I knew that they were cherubim.
{Eze 10:20} 这是我在迦巴鲁河边所见、以色列神荣耀以下的活物，我就知道他们是基路伯。
{Eze 10:21} Each had four faces, and each four wings, and underneath their wings the likeness of human hands.
{Eze 10:21} 各有四个脸面，四个翅膀，翅膀以下有人手的样式。
{Eze 10:22} And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the Chebar canal. Each one of them went straight forward.
{Eze 10:22} 至于他们脸的模样，并身体的形像，是我从前在迦巴鲁河边所看见的。他们俱各直往前行。
{Eze 11:1}  The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the house of the LORD, which faces east. And behold, at the entrance of the gateway there were twenty-five men. And I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
{Eze 11:1}  灵将我举起，带到耶和华殿向东的东门。谁知，在门口有二十五个人，我见其中有民间的首领押朔的儿子雅撒尼亚和比拿雅的儿子毗拉提。
{Eze 11:2}  And he said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city;
{Eze 11:2}  耶和华对我说：“人子啊，这就是图谋罪孽的人，在这城中给人设恶谋。
{Eze 11:3}  who say, 'The time is not near to build houses. This city is the cauldron, and we are the meat.'
{Eze 11:3}  他们说：‘盖房屋的时候尚未临近；这城是锅，我们是肉。’
{Eze 11:4}  Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man."
{Eze 11:4}  人子啊，因此你当说预言，说预言攻击他们。”
{Eze 11:5}  And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, "Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel. For I know the things that come into your mind.
{Eze 11:5}  耶和华的灵降在我身上，对我说：“你当说，耶和华如此说：以色列家啊，你们口中所说的，心里所想的，我都知道。
{Eze 11:6}  You have multiplied your slain in this city and have filled its streets with the slain.
{Eze 11:6}  你们在这城中杀人增多，使被杀的人充满街道。
{Eze 11:7}  Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the meat, and this city is the cauldron, but you shall be brought out of the midst of it.
{Eze 11:7}  所以主耶和华如此说：你们杀在城中的人就是肉，这城就是锅；你们却要从其中被带出去。
{Eze 11:8}  You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 11:8}  你们怕刀剑，我必使刀剑临到你们。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 11:9}  And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you.
{Eze 11:9}  我必从这城中带出你们去，交在外邦人的手中，且要在你们中间施行审判。
{Eze 11:10} You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 11:10} 你们必倒在刀下；我必在以色列的境界审判你们，你们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 11:11} This city shall not be your cauldron, nor shall you be the meat in the midst of it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,
{Eze 11:11} 这城必不作你们的锅，你们也不作其中的肉。我必在以色列的境界审判你们，
{Eze 11:12} and you shall know that I am the LORD. For you have not walked in my statutes, nor obeyed my rules, but have acted according to the rules of the nations that are around you."
{Eze 11:12} 你们就知道我是耶和华；因为你们没有遵行我的律例，也没有顺从我的典章，却随从你们四围列国的恶规。”
{Eze 11:13} And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?"
{Eze 11:13} 我正说预言的时候，比拿雅的儿子毗拉提死了。于是我俯伏在地，大声呼叫说：“哎！主耶和华啊，你要将以色列剩下的人灭绝净尽吗？”
{Eze 11:14} And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 11:14} 耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 11:15} "Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, your kinsmen, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, 'Go far from the LORD; to us this land is given for a possession.'
{Eze 11:15} “人子啊，耶路撒冷的居民对你的弟兄、你的本族、你的亲属、以色列全家，就是对大众说：‘你们远离耶和华吧！这地是赐给我们为业的。’
{Eze 11:16} Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a while in the countries where they have gone.'
{Eze 11:16} 所以你当说：‘耶和华如此说：我虽将以色列全家远远迁移到列国中，将他们分散在列邦内，我还要在他们所到的列邦，暂作他们的圣所。’
{Eze 11:17} Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.'
{Eze 11:17} 你当说：‘主耶和华如此说：我必从万民中招聚你们，从分散的列国内聚集你们，又要将以色列地赐给你们。’
{Eze 11:18} And when they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.
{Eze 11:18} 他们必到那里，也必从其中除掉一切可憎可厌的物。
{Eze 11:19} And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
{Eze 11:19} 我要使他们有合一的心，也要将新灵放在他们里面，又从他们肉体中除掉石心，赐给他们肉心，
{Eze 11:20} that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
{Eze 11:20} 使他们顺从我的律例，谨守遵行我的典章。他们要作我的子民，我要作他们的神。
{Eze 11:21} But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 11:21} 至于那些心中随从可憎可厌之物的，我必照他们所行的报应在他们头上。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 11:22} Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
{Eze 11:22} 于是，基路伯展开翅膀，轮子都在他们旁边；在他们以上有以色列神的荣耀。
{Eze 11:23} And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain that is on the east side of the city.
{Eze 11:23} 耶和华的荣耀从城中上升，停在城东的那座山上。
{Eze 11:24} And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me.
{Eze 11:24} 灵将我举起，在异象中藉着神的灵将我带进迦勒底地，到被掳的人那里；我所见的异象就离我上升去了。
{Eze 11:25} And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.
{Eze 11:25} 我便将耶和华所指示我的一切事都说给被掳的人听。
{Eze 12:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 12:1}  耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 12:2}  "Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, but see not, who have ears to hear, but hear not, for they are a rebellious house.
{Eze 12:2}  “人子啊，你住在悖逆的家中。他们有眼睛看不见，有耳朵听不见，因为他们是悖逆之家。
{Eze 12:3}  As for you, son of man, prepare for yourself an exile's baggage, and go into exile by day in their sight. You shall go like an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house.
{Eze 12:3}  所以人子啊，你要预备掳去使用的物件，在白日当他们眼前从你所住的地方移到别处去；他们虽是悖逆之家，或者可以揣摩思想。
{Eze 12:4}  You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile, and you shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as those do who must go into exile.
{Eze 12:4}  你要在白日当他们眼前带出你的物件去，好像预备掳去使用的物件。到了晚上，你要在他们眼前亲自出去，像被掳的人出去一样。
{Eze 12:5}  In their sight dig through the wall, and bring your baggage out through it.
{Eze 12:5}  你要在他们眼前挖通了墙，从其中将物件带出去。
{Eze 12:6}  In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder and carry it out at dusk. You shall cover your face that you may not see the land, for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel."
{Eze 12:6}  到天黑时，你要当他们眼前搭在肩头上带出去，并要蒙住脸看不见地，因为我立你作以色列家的预兆。”
{Eze 12:7}  And I did as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands. I brought out my baggage at dusk, carrying it on my shoulder in their sight.
{Eze 12:7}  我就照着所吩咐的去行，白日带出我的物件，好像预备掳去使用的物件。到了晚上，我用手挖通了墙。天黑的时候，就当他们眼前搭在肩头上带出去。
{Eze 12:8}  In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 12:8}  次日早晨，耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 12:9}  "Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, 'What are you doing?'
{Eze 12:9}  “人子啊，以色列家，就是那悖逆之家，岂不是问你说：‘你作什么呢？’
{Eze 12:10} Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.'
{Eze 12:10} 你要对他们说：‘主耶和华如此说：这是关乎耶路撒冷的君王和他周围以色列全家的预表（原文作担子）。’
{Eze 12:11} Say, 'I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.'
{Eze 12:11} 你要说：‘我作你们的预兆：我怎样行，他们所遭遇的也必怎样，他们必被掳去。’
{Eze 12:12} And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes.
{Eze 12:12} 他们中间的君王也必在天黑的时候将物件搭在肩头上带出去。他们要挖通了墙，从其中带出去。他必蒙住脸，眼看不见地。
{Eze 12:13} And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there.
{Eze 12:13} 我必将我的网撒在他身上，他必在我的网罗中缠住。我必带他到迦勒底人之地的巴比伦；他虽死在那里，却看不见那地。
{Eze 12:14} And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.
{Eze 12:14} 周围一切帮助他的和他所有的军队，我必分散四方（方：原文作风），也要拔刀追赶他们。
{Eze 12:15} And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
{Eze 12:15} 我将他们四散在列国、分散在列邦的时候，他们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 12:16} But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the LORD."
{Eze 12:16} 我却要留下他们几个人得免刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫，使他们在所到的各国中述说他们一切可憎的事，人就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 12:17} And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 12:17} 耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 12:18} "Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink water with trembling and with anxiety.
{Eze 12:18} “人子啊，你吃饭必胆战，喝水必惶惶忧虑。
{Eze 12:19} And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink water in dismay. In this way her land will be stripped of all it contains, on account of the violence of all those who dwell in it.
{Eze 12:19} 你要对这地的百姓说：主耶和华论耶路撒冷和以色列地的居民如此说，他们吃饭必忧虑，喝水必惊惶。因其中居住的众人所行强暴的事，这地必然荒废，一无所存。
{Eze 12:20} And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the LORD."
{Eze 12:20} 有居民的城邑必变为荒场，地也必变为荒废；你们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 12:21} And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 12:21} 耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 12:22} "Son of man, what is this proverb that you have about the land of Israel, saying, 'The days grow long, and every vision comes to nothing'?
{Eze 12:22} “人子啊，在你们以色列地怎么有这俗语，说‘日子迟延，一切异象都落了空’呢？
{Eze 12:23} Tell them therefore, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.' But say to them, The days are near, and the fulfillment of every vision.
{Eze 12:23} 你要告诉他们说：‘主耶和华如此说：我必使这俗语止息，以色列中不再用这俗语。’你却要对他们说：‘日子临近，一切的异象必都应验。’
{Eze 12:24} For there shall be no more any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
{Eze 12:24} 从此，在以色列家中必不再有虚假的异象和奉承的占卜。
{Eze 12:25} For I am the LORD; I will speak the word that I will speak, and it will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 12:25} 我耶和华说话，所说的必定成就，不再耽延。你们这悖逆之家，我所说的话必趁你们在世的日子成就。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 12:26} And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 12:26} 耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 12:27} "Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, 'The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.'
{Eze 12:27} “人子啊，以色列家的人说：‘他所见的异象是关乎后来许多的日子，所说的预言是指着极远的时候。’
{Eze 12:28} Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: None of my words will be delayed any longer, but the word that I speak will be performed, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 12:28} 所以你要对他们说：‘主耶和华如此说：我的话没有一句再耽延的，我所说的必定成就。这是主耶和华说的。’”
{Eze 13:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 13:1}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 13:2}  "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, who are prophesying, and say to those who prophesy from their own hearts: 'Hear the word of the LORD!'
{Eze 13:2}  “人子啊，你要说预言攻击以色列中说预言的先知，对那些本己心发预言的说：‘你们当听耶和华的话。’”
{Eze 13:3}  Thus says the Lord GOD, Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
{Eze 13:3}  主耶和华如此说：“愚顽的先知有祸了，他们随从自己的心意，却一无所见。
{Eze 13:4}  Your prophets have been like jackals among ruins, O Israel.
{Eze 13:4}  以色列啊，你的先知好像荒场中的狐狸，
{Eze 13:5}  You have not gone up into the breaches, or built up a wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in battle in the day of the LORD.
{Eze 13:5}  没有上去堵挡破口，也没有为以色列家重修墙垣，使他们当耶和华的日子在阵上站立得住。
{Eze 13:6}  They have seen false visions and lying divinations. They say, 'Declares the LORD,' when the LORD has not sent them, and yet they expect him to fulfill their word.
{Eze 13:6}  这些人所见的是虚假，是谎诈的占卜。他们说是耶和华说的，其实耶和华并没有差遣他们，他们倒使人指望那话必然立定。
{Eze 13:7}  Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination, whenever you have said, 'Declares the LORD,' although I have not spoken?"
{Eze 13:7}  你们岂不是见了虚假的异象吗？岂不是说了谎诈的占卜吗？你们说，这是耶和华说的，其实我没有说。”
{Eze 13:8}  Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "Because you have uttered falsehood and seen lying visions, therefore behold, I am against you, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 13:8}  所以主耶和华如此说：“因你们说的是虚假，见的是谎诈，我就与你们反对。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 13:9}  My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who give lying divinations. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
{Eze 13:9}  我的手必攻击那见虚假异象、用谎诈占卜的先知，他们必不列在我百姓的会中，不录在以色列家的册上，也不进入以色列地；你们就知道我是主耶和华。
{Eze 13:10} Precisely because they have misled my people, saying, 'Peace,' when there is no peace, and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets smear it with whitewash,
{Eze 13:10} 因为他们诱惑我的百姓，说：‘平安！’其实没有平安，就像有人立起墙壁，他们倒用未泡透的灰抹上。
{Eze 13:11} say to those who smear it with whitewash that it shall fall! There will be a deluge of rain, and you, O great hailstones, will fall, and a stormy wind break out.
{Eze 13:11} 所以你要对那些抹上未泡透灰的人说：‘墙要倒塌，必有暴雨漫过。大冰雹啊，你们要降下，狂风也要吹裂这墙。’
{Eze 13:12} And when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, 'Where is the coating with which you smeared it?'
{Eze 13:12} 这墙倒塌之后，人岂不问你们说：‘你们抹上未泡透的灰在那里呢？’”
{Eze 13:13} Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to make a full end.
{Eze 13:13} 所以主耶和华如此说：“我要发怒，使狂风吹裂这墙，在怒中使暴雨漫过，又发怒降下大冰雹，毁灭这墙。
{Eze 13:14} And I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 13:14} 我要这样拆毁你们那未泡透灰所抹的墙，拆平到地，以致根基露出，墙必倒塌，你们也必在其中灭亡；你们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 13:15} Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash, and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it,
{Eze 13:15} 我要这样向墙和用未泡透灰抹墙的人成就我怒中所定的，并要对你们说：‘墙和抹墙的人都没有了。’
{Eze 13:16} the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 13:16} 这抹墙的就是以色列的先知，他们指着耶路撒冷说预言，为这城见了平安的异象，其实没有平安。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 13:17} "And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own hearts. Prophesy against them
{Eze 13:17} “人子啊，你要面向本民中、从己心发预言的女子说预言，攻击他们，
{Eze 13:18} and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive?
{Eze 13:18} 说主耶和华如此说：‘这些妇女有祸了！他们为众人的膀臂缝靠枕，给高矮之人做下垂的头巾，为要猎取人的性命。难道你们要猎取我百姓的性命，为利己将人救活吗？
{Eze 13:19} You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live, by your lying to my people, who listen to lies.
{Eze 13:19} 你们为两把大麦，为几块饼，在我民中亵渎我，对肯听谎言的民说谎，杀死不该死的人，救活不该活的人。’”
{Eze 13:20} "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls whom you hunt go free, the souls like birds.
{Eze 13:20} 所以主耶和华如此说：“看哪，我与你们的靠枕反对，就是你们用以猎取人、使人的性命如鸟飞的。我要将靠枕从你们的膀臂上扯去，释放你们猎取如鸟飞的人。
{Eze 13:21} Your veils also I will tear off and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 13:21} 我也必撕裂你们下垂的头巾，救我百姓脱离你们的手，不再被猎取，落在你们手中。你们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 13:22} Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not grieved him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his evil way to save his life,
{Eze 13:22} 我不使义人伤心，你们却以谎话使他伤心，又坚固恶人的手，使他不回头离开恶道得以救活。
{Eze 13:23} therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. And you shall know that I am the LORD."
{Eze 13:23} 你们就不再见虚假的异象，也不再行占卜的事；我必救我的百姓脱离你们的手；你们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 14:1}  Then certain of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.
{Eze 14:1}  有几个以色列长老到我这里来，坐在我面前。
{Eze 14:2}  And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 14:2}  耶和华的话就临到我说：
{Eze 14:3}  "Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them?
{Eze 14:3}  “人子啊，这些人已将他们的假神接到心里，把陷于罪的绊脚石放在面前，我岂能丝毫被他们求问吗？
{Eze 14:4}  Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols,
{Eze 14:4}  所以你要告诉他们：‘主耶和华如此说：以色列家的人中，凡将他的假神接到心里，把陷于罪的绊脚石放在面前，又就了先知来的，我耶和华在他所求的事上，必按他众多的假神回答他（或作：必按他拜许多假神的罪报应他），
{Eze 14:5}  that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols.
{Eze 14:5}  好在以色列家的心事上捉住他们，因为他们都藉着假神与我生疏。’
{Eze 14:6}  "Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
{Eze 14:6}  “所以你要告诉以色列家说：‘主耶和华如此说：回头吧！离开你们的偶像，转脸莫从你们一切可憎的事。’
{Eze 14:7}  For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to consult me through him, I the LORD will answer him myself.
{Eze 14:7}  因为以色列家的人，或在以色列中寄居的外人，凡与我隔绝，将他的假神接到心里，把陷于罪的绊脚石放在面前，又就了先知来要为自己的事求问我的，我耶和华必亲自回答他。
{Eze 14:8}  And I will set my face against that man; I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 14:8}  我必向那人变脸，使他作了警戒，笑谈，令人惊骇，并且我要将他从我民中剪除；你们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 14:9}  And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
{Eze 14:9}  先知若被迷惑说一句预言，是我耶和华任那先知受迷惑，我也必向他伸手，将他从我民以色列中除灭。
{Eze 14:10} And they shall bear their punishment--the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike--
{Eze 14:10} 他们必担当自己的罪孽。先知的罪孽和求问之人的罪孽都是一样，
{Eze 14:11} that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 14:11} 好使以色列家不再走迷离开我，不再因各样的罪过玷污自己，只要作我的子民，我作他们的神。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 14:12} And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 14:12} 耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 14:13} "Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it and break its supply of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,
{Eze 14:13} “人子啊，若有一国犯罪干犯我，我也向他伸手折断他们的杖，就是断绝他们的粮，使饥荒临到那地，将人与牲畜从其中剪除；
{Eze 14:14} even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 14:14} 其中虽有挪亚、但以理、约伯这三人，他们只能因他们的义救自己的性命。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 14:15} "If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no one may pass through because of the beasts,
{Eze 14:15} 我若使恶兽经过糟践那地，使地荒凉，以致因这些兽，人都不得经过；
{Eze 14:16} even if these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.
{Eze 14:16} 虽有这三人在其中，主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，他们连儿带女都不能得救，只能自己得救，那地仍然荒凉。
{Eze 14:17} "Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say, Let a sword pass through the land, and I cut off from it man and beast,
{Eze 14:17} 或者我使刀剑临到那地，说：刀剑哪，要经过那地，以致我将人与牲畜从其中剪除；
{Eze 14:18} though these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they alone would be delivered.
{Eze 14:18} 虽有这三人在其中，主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，他们连儿带女都不能得救，只能自己得救。
{Eze 14:19} "Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my wrath upon it with blood, to cut off from it man and beast,
{Eze 14:19} 或者我叫瘟疫流行那地，使我灭命（原文作带血）的忿怒倾在其上，好将人与牲畜从其中剪除；
{Eze 14:20} even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness.
{Eze 14:20} 虽有挪亚、但以理、约伯在其中，主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，他们连儿带女都不能救，只能因他们的义救自己的性命。”
{Eze 14:21} "For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four disastrous acts of judgment, sword, famine, wild beasts, and pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!
{Eze 14:21} 主耶和华如此说：“我将这四样大灾，就是刀剑、饥荒、恶兽、瘟疫降在耶路撒冷，将人与牲畜从其中剪除，岂不更重吗？
{Eze 14:22} But behold, some survivors will be left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out; behold, when they come out to you, and you see their ways and their deeds, you will be consoled for the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it.
{Eze 14:22} 然而其中必有剩下的人，他们连儿带女必带到你们这里来，你们看见他们所行所为的，要因我降给耶路撒冷的一切灾祸，便得了安慰。
{Eze 14:23} They will console you, when you see their ways and their deeds, and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 14:23} 你们看见他们所行所为的，得了安慰，就知道我在耶路撒冷中所行的并非无故。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 15:1}  And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 15:1}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 15:2}  "Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?
{Eze 15:2}  “人子啊，葡萄树比别样树有什么强处？葡萄枝比众树枝有什么好处？
{Eze 15:3}  Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take a peg from it to hang any vessel on it?
{Eze 15:3}  其上可以取木料做什么工用，可以取来做钉子挂什么器皿吗？
{Eze 15:4}  Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?
{Eze 15:4}  看哪，已经抛在火中当作柴烧，火既烧了两头，中间也被烧了，还有益于工用吗？
{Eze 15:5}  Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything!
{Eze 15:5}  完全的时候尚且不合乎什么工用，何况被火烧坏，还能合乎什么工用吗？”
{Eze 15:6}  Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{Eze 15:6}  所以，主耶和华如此说：“众树以内的葡萄树，我怎样使他在火中当柴，也必照样待耶路撒冷的居民。
{Eze 15:7}  And I will set my face against them. Though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them, and you will know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.
{Eze 15:7}  我必向他们变脸；他们虽从火中出来，火却要烧灭他们。我向他们变脸的时候，你们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 15:8}  And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 15:8}  我必使地土荒凉，因为他们行事干犯我。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 16:1}  Again the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 16:1}  耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 16:2}  "Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations,
{Eze 16:2}  “人子啊，你要使耶路撒冷知道他那些可憎的事，
{Eze 16:3}  and say, Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are of the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
{Eze 16:3}  说主耶和华对耶路撒冷如此说：你根本，你出世，是在迦南地；你父亲是亚摩利人，你母亲是赫人。
{Eze 16:4}  And as for your birth, on the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.
{Eze 16:4}  论到你出世的景况，在你初生的日子没有为你断脐带，也没有用水洗你，使你洁净，丝毫没有撒盐在你身上，也没有用布裹你。
{Eze 16:5}  No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you, but you were cast out on the open field, for you were abhorred, on the day that you were born.
{Eze 16:5}  谁的眼也不可怜你，为你做一件这样的事怜恤你；但你初生的日子扔在田野，是因你被厌恶。
{Eze 16:6}  "And when I passed by you and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you in your blood, 'Live!' I said to you in your blood, 'Live!'
{Eze 16:6}  “我从你旁边经过，见你滚在血中，就对你说：你虽在血中，仍可存活；你虽在血中，仍可存活。
{Eze 16:7}  I made you flourish like a plant of the field. And you grew up and became tall and arrived at full adornment. Your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown; yet you were naked and bare.
{Eze 16:7}  我使你生长好像田间所长的，你就渐渐长大，以致极其俊美，两乳成形，头发长成，你却仍然赤身露体。
{Eze 16:8}  "When I passed by you again and saw you, behold, you were at the age for love, and I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness; I made my vow to you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord GOD, and you became mine.
{Eze 16:8}  “我从你旁边经过，看见你的时候正动爱情，便用衣襟搭在你身上，遮盖你的赤体；又向你起誓，与你结盟，你就归于我。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 16:9}  Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil.
{Eze 16:9}  那时我用水洗你，洗净你身上的血，又用油抹你。
{Eze 16:10} I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with fine leather. I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk.
{Eze 16:10} 我也使你身穿绣花衣服，脚穿海狗皮鞋，并用细麻布给你束腰，用丝绸为衣披在你身上，
{Eze 16:11} And I adorned you with ornaments and put bracelets on your wrists and a chain on your neck.
{Eze 16:11} 又用妆饰打扮你，将镯子戴在你手上，将金链戴在你项上。
{Eze 16:12} And I put a ring on your nose and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
{Eze 16:12} 我也将环子戴在你鼻子上，将耳环戴在你耳朵上，将华冠戴在你头上。
{Eze 16:13} Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour and honey and oil. You grew exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty.
{Eze 16:13} 这样，你就有金银的妆饰，穿的是细麻衣和丝绸，并绣花衣；吃的是细面、蜂蜜，并油。你也极其美貌，发达到王后的尊荣。
{Eze 16:14} And your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor that I had bestowed on you, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 16:14} 你美貌的名声传在列邦中，你十分美貌，是因我加在你身上的威荣。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 16:15} "But you trusted in your beauty and played the whore because of your renown and lavished your whorings on any passerby; your beauty became his.
{Eze 16:15} “只是你仗着自己的美貌，又因你的名声就行邪淫。你纵情淫乱，使过路的任意而行。
{Eze 16:16} You took some of your garments and made for yourself colorful shrines, and on them played the whore. The like has never been, nor ever shall be.
{Eze 16:16} 你用衣服为自己在高处结彩，在其上行邪淫。这样的事将来必没有，也必不再行了。
{Eze 16:17} You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and with them played the whore.
{Eze 16:17} 你又将我所给你那华美的金银、宝器为自己制造人像，与他行邪淫；
{Eze 16:18} And you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and my incense before them.
{Eze 16:18} 又用你的绣花衣服给他披上，并将我的膏油和香料摆在他跟前；
{Eze 16:19} Also my bread that I gave you--I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey--you set before them for a pleasing aroma; and so it was, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 16:19} 又将我赐给你的食物，就是我赐给你吃的细面、油，和蜂蜜，都摆在他跟前为馨香的供物。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 16:20} And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your whorings so small a matter
{Eze 16:20} 并且你将给我所生的儿女焚献给他。
{Eze 16:21} that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them?
{Eze 16:21} 你行淫乱岂是小事，竟将我的儿女杀了，使他们经火归与他吗？
{Eze 16:22} And in all your abominations and your whorings you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, wallowing in your blood.
{Eze 16:22} 你行这一切可憎和淫乱的事，并未追念你幼年赤身露体滚在血中的日子。”
{Eze 16:23} "And after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! declares the Lord GOD),
{Eze 16:23} “你行这一切恶事之后（主耶和华说：你有祸了！有祸了！）
{Eze 16:24} you built yourself a vaulted chamber and made yourself a lofty place in every square.
{Eze 16:24} 又为自己建造圆顶花楼，在各街上做了高台。
{Eze 16:25} At the head of every street you built your lofty place and made your beauty an abomination, offering yourself to any passerby and multiplying your whoring.
{Eze 16:25} 你在一切市口上建造高台，使你的美貌变为可憎的，又与一切过路的多行淫乱。
{Eze 16:26} You also played the whore with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your whoring, to provoke me to anger.
{Eze 16:26} 你也和你邻邦放纵情欲的埃及人行淫，加增你的淫乱，惹我发怒。
{Eze 16:27} Behold, therefore, I stretched out my hand against you and diminished your allotted portion and delivered you to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior.
{Eze 16:27} 因此我伸手攻击你，减少你应用的粮食，又将你交给恨你的非利士众女（众女是城邑的意思；本章下同），使他们任意待你。他们见你的淫行，为你羞耻。
{Eze 16:28} You played the whore also with the Assyrians, because you were not satisfied; yes, you played the whore with them, and still you were not satisfied.
{Eze 16:28} 你因贪色无厌，又与亚述人行淫，与他们行淫之后，仍不满意，
{Eze 16:29} You multiplied your whoring also with the trading land of Chaldea, and even with this you were not satisfied.
{Eze 16:29} 并且多行淫乱，直到那贸易之地，就是迦勒底，你仍不满意。
{Eze 16:30} "How sick is your heart, declares the Lord GOD, because you did all these things, the deeds of a brazen prostitute,
{Eze 16:30} 主耶和华说：你行这一切事，都是不知羞耻妓女所行的，可见你的心是何等懦弱！
{Eze 16:31} building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street, and making your lofty place in every square. Yet you were not like a prostitute, because you scorned payment.
{Eze 16:31} 因你在一切市口上建造圆顶花楼，在各街上做了高台，你却藐视赏赐，不像妓女。
{Eze 16:32} Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!
{Eze 16:32} 哎！你这行淫的妻啊，宁肯接外人，不接丈夫。
{Eze 16:33} Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side with your whorings.
{Eze 16:33} 凡妓女是得人赠送，你反倒赠送你所爱的人，贿赂他们从四围来与你行淫。
{Eze 16:34} So you were different from other women in your whorings. No one solicited you to play the whore, and you gave payment, while no payment was given to you; therefore you were different.
{Eze 16:34} 你行淫与别的妇女相反，因为不是人从你行淫；你既赠送人，人并不赠送你；所以你与别的妇女相反。”
{Eze 16:35} "Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of the LORD:
{Eze 16:35} “你这妓女啊，要听耶和华的话。
{Eze 16:36} Thus says the Lord GOD, Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your whorings with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them,
{Eze 16:36} 主耶和华如此说：因你的污秽倾泄了，你与你所爱的行淫露出下体，又因你拜一切可憎的偶像，流儿女的血献给他，
{Eze 16:37} therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from every side and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.
{Eze 16:37} 我就要将你一切相欢相爱的和你一切所恨的都聚集来，从四围攻击你；又将你的下体露出，使他们看尽了。
{Eze 16:38} And I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy.
{Eze 16:38} 我也要审判你，好像官长审判淫妇和流人血的妇女一样。我因忿怒忌恨，使流血的罪归到你身上。
{Eze 16:39} And I will give you into their hands, and they shall throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your lofty places. They shall strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels and leave you naked and bare.
{Eze 16:39} 我又要将你交在他们手中；他们必拆毁你的圆顶花楼，毁坏你的高台，剥去你的衣服，夺取你的华美宝器，留下你赤身露体。
{Eze 16:40} They shall bring up a crowd against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
{Eze 16:40} 他们也必带多人来攻击你，用石头打死你，用刀剑刺透你，
{Eze 16:41} And they shall burn your houses and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women. I will make you stop playing the whore, and you shall also give payment no more.
{Eze 16:41} 用火焚烧你的房屋，在许多妇人眼前向你施行审判。我必使你不再行淫，也不再赠送与人。
{Eze 16:42} So will I satisfy my wrath on you, and my jealousy shall depart from you. I will be calm and will no more be angry.
{Eze 16:42} 这样，我就止息向你发的忿怒，我的忌恨也要离开你，我要安静不再恼怒。
{Eze 16:43} Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things, therefore, behold, I have returned your deeds upon your head, declares the Lord GOD. Have you not committed lewdness in addition to all your abominations?
{Eze 16:43} 因你不追念你幼年的日子，在这一切的事上向我发烈怒，所以我必照你所行的报应在你头上，你就不再贪淫，行那一切可憎的事。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 16:44} "Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you: 'Like mother, like daughter.'
{Eze 16:44} “凡说俗语的必用俗语攻击你，说：‘母亲怎样，女儿也怎样。’
{Eze 16:45} You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
{Eze 16:45} 你正是你母亲的女儿，厌弃丈夫和儿女；你正是你姊妹的姊妹，厌弃丈夫和儿女。你母亲是赫人，你父亲是亚摩利人。
{Eze 16:46} And your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.
{Eze 16:46} 你的姊姊是撒玛利亚，他和他的众女住在你左边；你的妹妹是所多玛，他和他的众女住在你右边。
{Eze 16:47} Not only did you walk in their ways and do according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.
{Eze 16:47} 你没有效法他们的行为，也没有照他们可憎的事去做，你以那为小事，你一切所行的倒比他们更坏。
{Eze 16:48} As I live, declares the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done.
{Eze 16:48} 主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，你妹妹所多玛与他的众女尚未行你和你众女所行的事。
{Eze 16:49} Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy.
{Eze 16:49} 看哪，你妹妹所多玛的罪孽是这样：他和他的众女都心骄气傲，粮食饱足，大享安逸，并没有扶助困苦和穷乏人的手。
{Eze 16:50} They were haughty and did an abomination before me. So I removed them, when I saw it.
{Eze 16:50} 他们狂傲，在我面前行可憎的事，我看见便将他们除掉。
{Eze 16:51} Samaria has not committed half your sins. You have committed more abominations than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations that you have committed.
{Eze 16:51} 撒玛利亚没有犯你一半的罪，你行可憎的事比他更多，使你的姊妹因你所行一切可憎的事，倒显为义。
{Eze 16:52} Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have intervened on behalf of your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.
{Eze 16:52} 你既断定你姊妹为义（为义：或作当受羞辱），就要担当自己的羞辱；因你所犯的罪比他们更为可憎，他们就比你更显为义；你既使你的姊妹显为义，你就要抱愧担当自己的羞辱。”
{Eze 16:53} "I will restore their fortunes, both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes in their midst,
{Eze 16:53} “我必叫他们被掳的归回，就是叫所多玛和他的众女，撒玛利亚和他的众女，并你们中间被掳的，都要归回，
{Eze 16:54} that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done, becoming a consolation to them.
{Eze 16:54} 好使你担当自己的羞辱，并因你一切所行的使他们得安慰，你就抱愧。
{Eze 16:55} As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, and you and your daughters shall return to your former state.
{Eze 16:55} 你的妹妹所多玛和他的众女必归回原位；撒玛利亚和他的众女，你和你的众女，也必归回原位。
{Eze 16:56} Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride,
{Eze 16:56} 在你骄傲的日子，你的恶行没有显露以先，你的口就不提你的妹妹所多玛。那受了凌辱的亚兰众女和亚兰四围非利士的众女都恨恶你，藐视你。
{Eze 16:57} before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you have become an object of reproach for the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and for the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who despise you.
{Eze 16:57} (SEE 16:56)
{Eze 16:58} You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, declares the LORD.
{Eze 16:58} 耶和华说：你贪淫和可憎的事，你已经担当了。”
{Eze 16:59} "For thus says the Lord GOD: I will deal with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant,
{Eze 16:59} “主耶和华如此说：你这轻看誓言、背弃盟约的，我必照你所行的待你。
{Eze 16:60} yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish for you an everlasting covenant.
{Eze 16:60} 然而我要追念在你幼年时与你所立的约，也要与你立定永约。
{Eze 16:61} Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you take your sisters, both your elder and your younger, and I give them to you as daughters, but not on account of the covenant with you.
{Eze 16:61} 你接待你姊姊和你妹妹的时候，你要追念你所行的，自觉惭愧；并且我要将他们赐你为女儿，却不是按着前约。
{Eze 16:62} I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD,
{Eze 16:62} 我要坚定与你所立的约（你就知道我是耶和华），
{Eze 16:63} that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I atone for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 16:63} 好使你在我赦免你一切所行的时候，心里追念，自觉抱愧，又因你的羞辱就不再开口。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 17:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 17:1}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 17:2}  "Son of man, propound a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
{Eze 17:2}  “人子啊，你要向以色列家出谜语，设比喻，
{Eze 17:3}  say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, rich in plumage of many colors, came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar.
{Eze 17:3}  说主耶和华如此说：有一大鹰，翅膀大，翎毛长，羽毛丰满，彩色俱备，来到利巴嫩，将香柏树梢拧去，
{Eze 17:4}  He broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade and set it in a city of merchants.
{Eze 17:4}  就是折去香柏树尽尖的嫩枝，叼到贸易之地，放在买卖城中；
{Eze 17:5}  Then he took of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig,
{Eze 17:5}  又将以色列地的枝子栽于肥田里，插在大水旁，如插柳树，
{Eze 17:6}  and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine, and its branches turned toward him, and its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs.
{Eze 17:6}  就渐渐生长，成为蔓延矮小的葡萄树。其枝转向那鹰，其根在鹰以下，于是成了葡萄树，生出枝子，发出小枝。
{Eze 17:7}  "And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage, and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the bed where it was planted, that he might water it.
{Eze 17:7}  “又有一大鹰，翅膀大，羽毛多。这葡萄树从栽种的畦中向这鹰弯过根来，发出枝子，好得他的浇灌。
{Eze 17:8}  It had been planted on good soil by abundant waters, that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine.
{Eze 17:8}  这树栽于肥田多水的旁边，好生枝子，结果子，成为佳美的葡萄树。
{Eze 17:9}  "Say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers, so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots.
{Eze 17:9}  你要说，主耶和华如此说：这葡萄树岂能发旺呢？鹰岂不拔出他的根来，芟除他的果子，使他枯干，使他发的嫩叶都枯干了吗？也不用大力和多民，就拔出他的根来。
{Eze 17:10} Behold, it is planted; will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it--wither away on the bed where it sprouted?"
{Eze 17:10} 葡萄树虽然栽种，岂能发旺呢？一经东风，岂不全然枯干吗？必在生长的畦中枯干了。”
{Eze 17:11} Then the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 17:11} 耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 17:12} "Say now to the rebellious house, Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes and brought them to him to Babylon.
{Eze 17:12} “你对那悖逆之家说：你们不知道这些事是什么意思吗？你要告诉他们说，巴比伦王曾到耶路撒冷，将其中的君王和首领带到巴比伦自己那里去。
{Eze 17:13} And he took one of the royal offspring and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath (the chief men of the land he had taken away),
{Eze 17:13} 从以色列的宗室中取一人与他立约，使他发誓，并将国中有势力的人掳去，
{Eze 17:14} that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and keep his covenant that it might stand.
{Eze 17:14} 使国低微不能自强，惟因守盟约得以存立。
{Eze 17:15} But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he thrive? Can one escape who does such things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape?
{Eze 17:15} 他却背叛巴比伦王，打发使者往埃及去，要他们给他马匹和多民。他岂能亨通呢？行这样事的人岂能逃脱呢？他背约岂能逃脱呢？
{Eze 17:16} "As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die.
{Eze 17:16} 他轻看向王所起的誓，背弃王与他所立的约。主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，他定要死在立他作王、巴比伦王的京都。
{Eze 17:17} Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives.
{Eze 17:17} 敌人筑垒造台，与他打仗的时候，为要剪除多人，法老虽领大军队和大群众，还是不能帮助他。
{Eze 17:18} He despised the oath in breaking the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand and did all these things; he shall not escape.
{Eze 17:18} 他轻看誓言，背弃盟约，已经投降，却又做这一切的事，他必不能逃脱。”
{Eze 17:19} Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely it is my oath that he despised, and my covenant that he broke. I will return it upon his head.
{Eze 17:19} 所以主耶和华如此说：“我指着我的永生起誓，他既轻看指我所起的誓，背弃指我所立的约，我必要使这罪归在他头上。
{Eze 17:20} I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treachery he has committed against me.
{Eze 17:20} 我必将我的网撒在他身上，他必在我的网罗中缠住。我必带他到巴比伦，并要在那里因他干犯我的罪刑罚他。
{Eze 17:21} And all the pick of his troops shall fall by the sword, and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind, and you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken."
{Eze 17:21} 他的一切军队，凡逃跑的，都必倒在刀下；所剩下的，也必分散四方（方：原文作风）。你们就知道说这话的是我耶和华。”
{Eze 17:22} Thus says the Lord GOD: "I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and will set it out. I will break off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
{Eze 17:22} 主耶和华如此说：“我要将香柏树梢拧去栽上，就是从尽尖的嫩枝中折一嫩枝，栽于极高的山上；
{Eze 17:23} On the mountain height of Israel will I plant it, that it may bear branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar. And under it will dwell every kind of bird; in the shade of its branches birds of every sort will nest.
{Eze 17:23} 在以色列高处的山栽上。他就生枝子，结果子，成为佳美的香柏树，各类飞鸟都必宿在其下，就是宿在枝子的荫下。
{Eze 17:24} And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the LORD; I bring low the high tree, and make high the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it."
{Eze 17:24} 田野的树木都必知道我耶和华使高树矮小，矮树高大；青树枯干，枯树发旺。我耶和华如此说，也如此行了。”
{Eze 18:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 18:1}  耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 18:2}  "What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge'?
{Eze 18:2}  “你们在以色列地怎么用这俗语说‘父亲吃了酸葡萄，儿子的牙酸倒了’呢？”
{Eze 18:3}  As I live, declares the Lord GOD, this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel.
{Eze 18:3}  主耶和华说：“我指着我的永生起誓，你们在以色列中，必不再有用这俗语的因由。
{Eze 18:4}  Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins shall die.
{Eze 18:4}  看哪，世人都是属我的；为父的怎样属我，为子的也照样属我；犯罪的，他必死亡。
{Eze 18:5}  "If a man is righteous and does what is just and right--
{Eze 18:5}  “人若是公义，且行正直与合理的事：
{Eze 18:6}  if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman in her time of menstrual impurity,
{Eze 18:6}  未曾在山上吃过祭偶像之物，未曾仰望以色列家的偶像，未曾玷污邻舍的妻，未曾在妇人的经期内亲近他，
{Eze 18:7}  does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, commits no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
{Eze 18:7}  未曾亏负人，乃将欠债之人的当头还给他；未曾抢夺人的物件，却将食物给饥饿的人吃，将衣服给赤身的人穿；
{Eze 18:8}  does not lend at interest or take any profit, withholds his hand from injustice, executes true justice between man and man,
{Eze 18:8}  未曾向借钱的弟兄取利，也未曾向借粮的弟兄多要，缩手不作罪孽，在两人之间，按至理判断；
{Eze 18:9}  walks in my statutes, and keeps my rules by acting faithfully--he is righteous; he shall surely live, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 18:9}  遵行我的律例，谨守我的典章，按诚实行事这人是公义的，必定存活。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 18:10} "If he fathers a son who is violent, a shedder of blood, who does any of these things
{Eze 18:10} “他若生一个儿子，作强盗，是流人血的，不行以上所说之善，反行其中之恶，乃在山上吃过祭偶像之物，并玷污邻舍的妻，
{Eze 18:11} (though he himself did none of these things), who even eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor's wife,
{Eze 18:11} (SEE 18:10)
{Eze 18:12} oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge, lifts up his eyes to the idols, commits abomination,
{Eze 18:12} 亏负困苦和穷乏的人，抢夺人的物，未曾将当头还给人，仰望偶像，并行可憎的事，
{Eze 18:13} lends at interest, and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.
{Eze 18:13} 向借钱的弟兄取利，向借粮的弟兄多要，这人岂能存活呢？他必不能存活。他行这一切可憎的事，必要死亡，他的罪（原文作血）必归到他身上。
{Eze 18:14} "Now suppose this man fathers a son who sees all the sins that his father has done; he sees, and does not do likewise:
{Eze 18:14} “他若生一个儿子，见父亲所犯的一切罪便惧怕（有古卷：思量），不照样去做；
{Eze 18:15} he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife,
{Eze 18:15} 未曾在山上吃过祭偶像之物，未曾仰望以色列家的偶像，未曾玷污邻舍的妻，
{Eze 18:16} does not oppress anyone, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
{Eze 18:16} 未曾亏负人，未曾取人的当头，未曾抢夺人的物件，却将食物给饥饿的人吃，将衣服给赤身的人穿，
{Eze 18:17} withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no interest or profit, obeys my rules, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; he shall surely live.
{Eze 18:17} 缩手不害贫穷人，未曾向借钱的弟兄取利，也未曾向借粮的弟兄多要；他顺从我的典章，遵行我的律例，就不因父亲的罪孽死亡，定要存活。
{Eze 18:18} As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die for his iniquity.
{Eze 18:18} 至于他父亲；因为欺人太甚，抢夺弟兄，在本国的民中行不善，他必因自己的罪孽死亡。
{Eze 18:19} "Yet you say, 'Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?' When the son has done what is just and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live.
{Eze 18:19} “你们还说：‘儿子为何不担当父亲的罪孽呢？’儿子行正直与合理的事，谨守遵行我的一切律例，他必定存活。
{Eze 18:20} The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.
{Eze 18:20} 惟有犯罪的，他必死亡。儿子必不担当父亲的罪孽，父亲也不担当儿子的罪孽。义人的善果必归自己，恶人的恶报也必归自己。
{Eze 18:21} "But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
{Eze 18:21} “恶人若回头离开所做的一切罪恶，谨守我一切的律例，行正直与合理的事，他必定存活，不至死亡。
{Eze 18:22} None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness that he has done he shall live.
{Eze 18:22} 他所犯的一切罪过都不被记念，因所行的义，他必存活。
{Eze 18:23} Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?
{Eze 18:23} 主耶和华说：恶人死亡，岂是我喜悦的吗？不是喜悦他回头离开所行的道存活吗？
{Eze 18:24} But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice and does the same abominations that the wicked person does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, for them he shall die.
{Eze 18:24} 义人若转离义行而作罪孽，照着恶人所行一切可憎的事而行，他岂能存活吗？他所行的一切义都不被记念；他必因所犯的罪、所行的恶死亡。
{Eze 18:25} "Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
{Eze 18:25} “你们还说：‘主的道不公平！’以色列家啊，你们当听，我的道岂不公平吗？你们的道岂不是不公平吗？
{Eze 18:26} When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it; for the injustice that he has done he shall die.
{Eze 18:26} 义人若转离义行而作罪孽死亡，他是因所作的罪孽死亡。
{Eze 18:27} Again, when a wicked person turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he shall save his life.
{Eze 18:27} 再者，恶人若回头离开所行的恶，行正直与合理的事，他必将性命救活了。
{Eze 18:28} Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions that he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
{Eze 18:28} 因为他思量，回头离开所犯的一切罪过，必定存活，不至死亡。
{Eze 18:29} Yet the house of Israel says, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
{Eze 18:29} 以色列家还说：‘主的道不公平！’以色列家啊，我的道岂不公平吗？你们的道岂不是不公平吗？”
{Eze 18:30} "Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin.
{Eze 18:30} 所以主耶和华说：“以色列家啊，我必按你们各人所行的审判你们。你们当回头离开所犯的一切罪过。这样，罪孽必不使你们败亡。
{Eze 18:31} Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel?
{Eze 18:31} 你们要将所犯的一切罪过尽行抛弃，自做一个新心和新灵。以色列家啊，你们何必死亡呢？
{Eze 18:32} For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord GOD; so turn, and live."
{Eze 18:32} 主耶和华说：我不喜悦那死人之死，所以你们当回头而存活。”
{Eze 19:1}  And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
{Eze 19:1}  你当为以色列的王作起哀歌，
{Eze 19:2}  and say: What was your mother? A lioness! Among lions she crouched; in the midst of young lions she reared her cubs.
{Eze 19:2}  说：你的母亲是什么呢？是个母狮子，蹲伏在狮子中间，在少壮狮子中养育小狮子。
{Eze 19:3}  And she brought up one of her cubs; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.
{Eze 19:3}  在他小狮子中养大一个，成了少壮狮子，学会抓食而吃人。
{Eze 19:4}  The nations heard about him; he was caught in their pit, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
{Eze 19:4}  列国听见了就把他捉在他们的坑中，用钩子拉到埃及地去。
{Eze 19:5}  When she saw that she waited in vain, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.
{Eze 19:5}  母狮见自己等候失了指望，就从他小狮子中又将一个养为少壮狮子。
{Eze 19:6}  He prowled among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men,
{Eze 19:6}  他在众狮子中走来走去，成了少壮狮子，学会抓食而吃人。
{Eze 19:7}  and seized their widows. He laid waste their cities, and the land was appalled and all who were in it at the sound of his roaring.
{Eze 19:7}  他知道列国的宫殿，又使他们的城邑变为荒场；因他咆哮的声音，遍地和其中所有的就都荒废。
{Eze 19:8}  Then the nations set against him from provinces on every side; they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
{Eze 19:8}  于是四围邦国各省的人来攻击他，将网撒在他身上，捉在他们的坑中。
{Eze 19:9}  With hooks they put him in a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into custody, that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel.
{Eze 19:9}  他们用钩子钩住他，将他放在笼中，带到巴比伦王那里，将他放入坚固之所，使他的声音在以色列山上不再听见。
{Eze 19:10} Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard planted by the water, fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water.
{Eze 19:10} 你的母亲先前如葡萄树，极其茂盛（原文作在你血中），栽于水旁。因为水多，就多结果子，满生枝子；
{Eze 19:11} Its strong stems became rulers' scepters; it towered aloft among the thick boughs; it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.
{Eze 19:11} 生出坚固的枝干，可作掌权者的杖。这枝干高举在茂密的枝中，而且他生长高大，枝子繁多，远远可见。
{Eze 19:12} But the vine was plucked up in fury, cast down to the ground; the east wind dried up its fruit; they were stripped off and withered. As for its strong stem, fire consumed it.
{Eze 19:12} 但这葡萄树因忿怒被拔出摔在地上；东风吹干其上的果子，坚固的枝干折断枯干，被火烧毁了；
{Eze 19:13} Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
{Eze 19:13} 如今栽于旷野干旱无水之地。
{Eze 19:14} And fire has gone out from the stem of its shoots, has consumed its fruit, so that there remains in it no strong stem, no scepter for ruling. This is a lamentation and has become a lamentation.
{Eze 19:14} 火也从他枝干中发出，烧灭果子，以致没有坚固的枝干可做掌权者的杖。这是哀歌，也必用以作哀歌。
{Eze 20:1}  In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
{Eze 20:1}  第七年五月初十日，有以色列的几个长老来求问耶和华，坐在我面前。
{Eze 20:2}  And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 20:2}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 20:3}  "Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD, Is it to inquire of me that you come? As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
{Eze 20:3}  “人子啊，你要告诉以色列的长老说，主耶和华如此说：你们来是求问我吗？主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，我必不被你们求问。
{Eze 20:4}  Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Let them know the abominations of their fathers,
{Eze 20:4}  人子啊，你要审问审问他们吗？你当使他们知道他们列祖那些可憎的事，
{Eze 20:5}  and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day when I chose Israel, I swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, making myself known to them in the land of Egypt; I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God.
{Eze 20:5}  对他们说，主耶和华如此说：当日我拣选以色列，向雅各家的后裔起誓，在埃及地将自己向他们显现，说：我是耶和华你们的神。
{Eze 20:6}  On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands.
{Eze 20:6}  那日我向他们起誓，必领他们出埃及地，到我为他们察看的流奶与蜜之地；那地在万国中是有荣耀的。
{Eze 20:7}  And I said to them, Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.
{Eze 20:7}  我对他们说，你们各人要抛弃眼所喜爱那可憎之物，不可因埃及的偶像玷污自己。我是耶和华你们的神。
{Eze 20:8}  But they rebelled against me and were not willing to listen to me. None of them cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. "Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
{Eze 20:8}  他们却悖逆我，不肯听从我，不抛弃他们眼所喜爱那可憎之物，不离弃埃及的偶像。“我就说，我要将我的忿怒倾在他们身上，在埃及地向他们成就我怒中所定的。
{Eze 20:9}  But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
{Eze 20:9}  我却为我名的缘故没有这样行，免得我名在他们所住的列国人眼前被亵渎；我领他们出埃及地，在这列国人的眼前将自己向他们显现。
{Eze 20:10} So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
{Eze 20:10} 这样，我就使他们出埃及地，领他们到旷野，
{Eze 20:11} I gave them my statutes and made known to them my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live.
{Eze 20:11} 将我的律例赐给他们，将我的典章指示他们；人若遵行就必因此活着。
{Eze 20:12} Moreover, I gave them my Sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
{Eze 20:12} 又将我的安息日赐给他们，好在我与他们中间为证据，使他们知道我耶和华是叫他们成为圣的。
{Eze 20:13} But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not walk in my statutes but rejected my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned. "Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them.
{Eze 20:13} 以色列家却在旷野悖逆我，不顺从我的律例，厌弃我的典章（人若遵行就必因此活着），大大干犯我的安息日。“我就说，要在旷野将我的忿怒倾在他们身上，灭绝他们。
{Eze 20:14} But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
{Eze 20:14} 我却为我名的缘故，没有这样行，免得我的名在我领他们出埃及的列国人眼前被亵渎。
{Eze 20:15} Moreover, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands,
{Eze 20:15} 并且我在旷野向他们起誓，必不领他们进入我所赐给他们流奶与蜜之地（那地在万国中是有荣耀的）；
{Eze 20:16} because they rejected my rules and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.
{Eze 20:16} 因为他们厌弃我的典章，不顺从我的律例，干犯我的安息日，他们的心随从自己的偶像。
{Eze 20:17} Nevertheless, my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make a full end of them in the wilderness.
{Eze 20:17} 虽然如此，我眼仍顾惜他们，不毁灭他们，不在旷野将他们灭绝净尽。
{Eze 20:18} "And I said to their children in the wilderness, 'Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their rules, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
{Eze 20:18} “我在旷野对他们的儿女说：不要遵行你们父亲的律例，不要谨守他们的恶规，也不要因他们的偶像玷污自己。
{Eze 20:19} I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and be careful to obey my rules,
{Eze 20:19} 我是耶和华你们的神，你们要顺从我的律例，谨守遵行我的典章，
{Eze 20:20} and keep my Sabbaths holy that they may be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.'
{Eze 20:20} 且以我的安息日为圣。这日在我与你们中间为证据，使你们知道我是耶和华你们的神。
{Eze 20:21} But the children rebelled against me. They did not walk in my statutes and were not careful to obey my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; they profaned my Sabbaths. "Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness.
{Eze 20:21} 只是他们的儿女悖逆我，不顺从我的律例，也不谨守遵行我的典章（人若遵行就必因此活着），干犯我的安息日。“我就说，要将我的忿怒倾在他们身上，在旷野向他们成就我怒中所定的。
{Eze 20:22} But I withheld my hand and acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
{Eze 20:22} 虽然如此，我却为我名的缘故缩手没有这样行，免得我的名在我领他们出埃及的列国人眼前被亵渎。
{Eze 20:23} Moreover, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,
{Eze 20:23} 并且我在旷野向他们起誓，必将他们分散在列国，四散在列邦；
{Eze 20:24} because they had not obeyed my rules, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols.
{Eze 20:24} 因为他们不遵行我的典章，竟厌弃我的律例，干犯我的安息日，眼目仰望他们父亲的偶像。
{Eze 20:25} Moreover, I gave them statutes that were not good and rules by which they could not have life,
{Eze 20:25} 我也任他们遵行不美的律例，谨守不能使人活着的恶规。
{Eze 20:26} and I defiled them through their very gifts in their offering up all their firstborn, that I might devastate them. I did it that they might know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 20:26} 因他们将一切头生的经火，我就任凭他们在这供献的事上玷污自己，好叫他们凄凉，使他们知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 20:27} "Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: In this also your fathers blasphemed me, by dealing treacherously with me.
{Eze 20:27} “人子啊，你要告诉以色列家说，主耶和华如此说：你们的列祖在得罪我的事上亵渎我；
{Eze 20:28} For when I had brought them into the land that I swore to give them, then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their pleasing aromas, and there they poured out their drink offerings.
{Eze 20:28} 因为我领他们到了我起誓应许赐给他们的地，他们看见各高山、各茂密树，就在那里献祭，奉上惹我发怒的供物，也在那里焚烧馨香的祭牲，并浇上奠祭。
{Eze 20:29} (I said to them, 'What is the high place to which you go?' So its name is called Bamah to this day.)
{Eze 20:29} 我就对他们说：你们所上的那高处叫什么呢？（那高处的名字叫巴麻直到今日。）
{Eze 20:30} "Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and go whoring after their detestable things?
{Eze 20:30} 所以你要对以色列家说，主耶和华如此说：你们仍照你们列祖所行的玷污自己吗？仍照他们可憎的事行邪淫吗？
{Eze 20:31} When you present your gifts and offer up your children in fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
{Eze 20:31} 你们奉上供物使你们儿子经火的时候，仍将一切偶像玷污自己，直到今日吗？以色列家啊，我岂被你们求问吗？主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，我必不被你们求问。
{Eze 20:32} "What is in your mind shall never happen--the thought, 'Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone.'
{Eze 20:32} “你们说：我们要像外邦人和列国的宗族一样，去事奉木头与石头。你们所起的这心意万不能成就。”
{Eze 20:33} "As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out I will be king over you.
{Eze 20:33} 主耶和华说：“我指着我的永生起誓，我总要作王，用大能的手和伸出来的膀臂，并倾出来的忿怒，治理你们。
{Eze 20:34} I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out.
{Eze 20:34} 我必用大能的手和伸出来的膀臂，并倾出来的忿怒，将你们从万民中领出来，从分散的列国内聚集你们。
{Eze 20:35} And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
{Eze 20:35} 我必带你们到外邦人的旷野，在那里当面刑罚你们。
{Eze 20:36} As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 20:36} 我怎样在埃及地的旷野刑罚你们的列祖，也必照样刑罚你们。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 20:37} I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
{Eze 20:37} 我必使你们从杖下经过，使你们被约拘束。
{Eze 20:38} I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against me. I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 20:38} 我必从你们中间除净叛逆和得罪我的人，将他们从所寄居的地方领出来，他们却不得入以色列地。你们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 20:39} "As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: Go serve every one of you his idols, now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols.
{Eze 20:39} “以色列家啊，至于你们，主耶和华如此说：从此以后若不听从我，就任凭你们去事奉偶像，只是不可再因你们的供物和偶像亵渎我的圣名。
{Eze 20:40} "For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land. There I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your sacred offerings.
{Eze 20:40} “主耶和华说：在我的圣山，就是以色列高处的山，所有以色列的全家都要事奉我。我要在那里悦纳你们，向你们要供物和初熟的土产，并一切的圣物。
{Eze 20:41} As a pleasing aroma I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered. And I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations.
{Eze 20:41} 我从万民中领你们出来，从分散的列国内聚集你们，那时我必悦纳你们好像馨香之祭，要在外邦人眼前在你们身上显为圣。
{Eze 20:42} And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the country that I swore to give to your fathers.
{Eze 20:42} 我领你们进入以色列地，就是我起誓应许赐给你们列祖之地，那时你们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 20:43} And there you shall remember your ways and all your deeds with which you have defiled yourselves, and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed.
{Eze 20:43} 你们在那里要追念玷污自己的行动作为，又要因所做的一切恶事厌恶自己。
{Eze 20:44} And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 20:44} 主耶和华说：以色列家啊，我为我名的缘故，不照着你们的恶行和你们的坏事待你们；你们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 20:45} And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 20:45} 耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 20:46} "Son of man, set your face toward the southland; preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb.
{Eze 20:46} “人子啊，你要面向南方，向南滴下预言攻击南方田野的树林。
{Eze 20:47} Say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree. The blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it.
{Eze 20:47} 对南方的树林说，要听耶和华的话。主耶和华如此说：我必使火在你中间着起，烧灭你中间的一切青树和枯树，猛烈的火焰必不熄灭。从南到北，人的脸面都被烧焦。
{Eze 20:48} All flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it; it shall not be quenched."
{Eze 20:48} 凡有血气的都必知道是我耶和华使火着起，这火必不熄灭。”
{Eze 20:49} Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! They are saying of me, 'Is he not a maker of parables?'"
{Eze 20:49} 于是我说：“哎！主耶和华啊，人都指着我说：他岂不是说比喻的吗？”
{Eze 21:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 21:1}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 21:2}  "Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel
{Eze 21:2}  “人子啊，你要面向耶路撒冷和圣所滴下预言，攻击以色列地。
{Eze 21:3}  and say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am against you and will draw my sword from its sheath and will cut off from you both righteous and wicked.
{Eze 21:3}  对以色列地说，耶和华如此说：我与你为敌，并要拔刀出鞘，从你中间将义人和恶人一并剪除。
{Eze 21:4}  Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall be drawn from its sheath against all flesh from south to north.
{Eze 21:4}  我既要从你中间剪除义人和恶人，所以我的刀要出鞘，自南至北攻击一切有血气的；
{Eze 21:5}  And all flesh shall know that I am the LORD. I have drawn my sword from its sheath; it shall not be sheathed again.
{Eze 21:5}  一切有血气的就知道我耶和华已经拔刀出鞘，必不再入鞘。
{Eze 21:6}  "As for you, son of man, groan; with breaking heart and bitter grief, groan before their eyes.
{Eze 21:6}  人子啊，你要叹息，在他们眼前弯着腰，苦苦地叹息。
{Eze 21:7}  And when they say to you, 'Why do you groan?' you shall say, 'Because of the news that it is coming. Every heart will melt, and all hands will be feeble; every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it is coming, and it will be fulfilled,'" declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 21:7}  他们问你说：‘为何叹息呢？’你就说：‘因为有风声、灾祸要来。人心都必消化，手都发软，精神衰败，膝弱如水。看哪，这灾祸临近，必然成就。这是主耶和华说的。’”
{Eze 21:8}  And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 21:8}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 21:9}  "Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord, say: "A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished,
{Eze 21:9}  “人子啊，你要预言。耶和华吩咐我如此说：有刀、有刀，是磨快擦亮的；
{Eze 21:10} sharpened for slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! (Or shall we rejoice? You have despised the rod, my son, with everything of wood.)
{Eze 21:10} 磨快为要行杀戮，擦亮为要像闪电。我们岂可快乐吗？罚我子的杖藐视各树。
{Eze 21:11} So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer.
{Eze 21:11} 这刀已经交给人擦亮，为要应手使用。这刀已经磨快擦亮，好交在行杀戮的人手中。
{Eze 21:12} Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people. It is against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Strike therefore upon your thigh.
{Eze 21:12} 人子啊，你要呼喊哀号，因为这刀临到我的百姓和以色列一切的首领。他们和我的百姓都交在刀下，所以你要拍腿叹息。
{Eze 21:13} For it will not be a testing--what could it do if you despise the rod?" declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 21:13} 有试验的事；若那藐视的杖归于无有，怎么样呢？这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 21:14} "As for you, son of man, prophesy. Clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, yes, three times, the sword for those to be slain. It is the sword for the great slaughter, which surrounds them,
{Eze 21:14} “人子啊，你要拍掌预言。我耶和华要使这刀，就是致死伤的刀，一连三次加倍刺人，进入他们的内屋，使大人受死伤的就是这刀。
{Eze 21:15} that their hearts may melt, and many stumble. At all their gates I have given the glittering sword. Ah, it is made like lightning; it is taken up for slaughter.
{Eze 21:15} 我设立这恐吓人的刀，攻击他们的一切城门，使他们的心消化，加增他们跌倒的事。哎！这刀造得像闪电，磨得尖利，要行杀戮。
{Eze 21:16} Cut sharply to the right; set yourself to the left, wherever your face is directed.
{Eze 21:16} 刀啊，你归在右边，摆在左边；你面向哪方，就向那方杀戮。
{Eze 21:17} I also will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my fury; I the LORD have spoken."
{Eze 21:17} 我也要拍掌，并要使我的忿怒止息。这是我耶和华说的。”
{Eze 21:18} The word of the LORD came to me again:
{Eze 21:18} 耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 21:19} "As for you, son of man, mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both of them shall come from the same land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the way to a city.
{Eze 21:19} “人子啊，你要定出两条路，好使巴比伦王的刀来。这两条路必从一地分出来，又要在通城的路口上画出一只手来。
{Eze 21:20} Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah, into Jerusalem the fortified.
{Eze 21:20} 你要定出一条路，使刀来到亚扪人的拉巴；又要定出一条路，使刀来到犹大的坚固城耶路撒冷。
{Eze 21:21} For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shakes the arrows; he consults the teraphim; he looks at the liver.
{Eze 21:21} 因为巴比伦王站在岔路那里，在两条路口上要占卜。他摇签（原文作箭）求问神像，察看牺牲的肝；
{Eze 21:22} Into his right hand comes the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth with murder, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build siege towers.
{Eze 21:22} 在右手中拿着为耶路撒冷占卜的签，使他安设撞城锤，张口叫杀，扬声呐喊，筑垒造台，以撞城锤，攻打城门。
{Eze 21:23} But to them it will seem like a false divination. They have sworn solemn oaths, but he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be taken.
{Eze 21:23} 据那些曾起誓的犹大人看来，这是虚假的占卜；但巴比伦王要使他们想起罪孽，以致将他们捉住。”
{Eze 21:24} "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear--because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand.
{Eze 21:24} 主耶和华如此说：“因你们的过犯显露，使你们的罪孽被记念，以致你们的罪恶在行为上都彰显出来；又因你们被记念，就被捉住。
{Eze 21:25} And you, O profane wicked one, prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of your final punishment,
{Eze 21:25} 你这受死伤行恶的以色列王啊，罪孽的尽头到了，受报的日子已到。
{Eze 21:26} thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. Exalt that which is low, and bring low that which is exalted.
{Eze 21:26} 主耶和华如此说：当除掉冠，摘下冕，景况必不再像先前；要使卑者升为高，使高者降为卑。
{Eze 21:27} A ruin, ruin, ruin I will make it. This also shall not be, until he comes, the one to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him.
{Eze 21:27} 我要将这国倾覆，倾覆，而又倾覆；这国也必不再有，直等到那应得的人来到，我就赐给他。”
{Eze 21:28} "And you, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; say, A sword, a sword is drawn for the slaughter. It is polished to consume and to flash like lightning--
{Eze 21:28} “人子啊，要发预言说：主耶和华论到亚扪人和他们的凌辱，吩咐我如此说：有刀，有拔出来的刀，已经擦亮，为行杀戮，使他像闪电以行吞灭。
{Eze 21:29} while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you--to place you on the necks of the profane wicked, whose day has come, the time of their final punishment.
{Eze 21:29} 人为你见虚假的异象，行谎诈的占卜，使你倒在受死伤之恶人的颈项上。他们罪孽到了尽头，受报的日子已到。
{Eze 21:30} Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you.
{Eze 21:30} 你将刀收入鞘吧！在你受造之处、生长之地，我必刑罚你。
{Eze 21:31} And I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of brutish men, skillful to destroy.
{Eze 21:31} 我必将我的恼恨倒在你身上，将我烈怒的火喷在你身上；又将你交在善于杀灭的畜类人手中。
{Eze 21:32} You shall be fuel for the fire. Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall be no more remembered, for I the LORD have spoken."
{Eze 21:32} 你必当柴被火焚烧，你的血必流在国中，你必不再被记念，因为这是我耶和华说的。”
{Eze 22:1}  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
{Eze 22:1}  耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 22:2}  "And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then declare to her all her abominations.
{Eze 22:2}  “人子啊，你要审问审问这流人血的城吗？当使他知道他一切可憎的事。
{Eze 22:3}  You shall say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A city that sheds blood in her midst, so that her time may come, and that makes idols to defile herself!
{Eze 22:3}  你要说，主耶和华如此说：哎！这城有流人血的事在其中，叫他受报的日期来到，又做偶像玷污自己，陷害自己。
{Eze 22:4}  You have become guilty by the blood that you have shed, and defiled by the idols that you have made, and you have brought your days near, the appointed time of your years has come. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all the countries.
{Eze 22:4}  你因流了人的血，就为有罪；你做了偶像，就玷污自己，使你受报之日临近，报应之年来到。所以我叫你受列国的凌辱和列邦的讥诮。
{Eze 22:5}  Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you; your name is defiled; you are full of tumult.
{Eze 22:5}  你这名臭、多乱的城啊，那些离你近、离你远的都必讥诮你。
{Eze 22:6}  "Behold, the princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood.
{Eze 22:6}  “看哪，以色列的首领各逞其能，在你中间流人之血。
{Eze 22:7}  Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you.
{Eze 22:7}  在你中间有轻慢父母的，有欺压寄居的，有亏负孤儿寡妇的。
{Eze 22:8}  You have despised my holy things and profaned my Sabbaths.
{Eze 22:8}  你藐视了我的圣物，干犯了我的安息日。
{Eze 22:9}  There are men in you who slander to shed blood, and people in you who eat on the mountains; they commit lewdness in your midst.
{Eze 22:9}  在你中间有谗谤人、流人血的；有在山上吃过祭偶像之物的，有行淫乱的。
{Eze 22:10} In you men uncover their fathers' nakedness; in you they violate women who are unclean in their menstrual impurity.
{Eze 22:10} 在你中间有露继母下体羞辱父亲的，有玷辱月经不洁净之妇人的。
{Eze 22:11} One commits abomination with his neighbor's wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; another in you violates his sister, his father's daughter.
{Eze 22:11} 这人与邻舍的妻行可憎的事；那人贪淫玷污儿妇；还有玷辱同父之姊妹的。
{Eze 22:12} In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take interest and profit and make gain of your neighbors by extortion; but me you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 22:12} 在你中间有为流人血受贿赂的；有向借钱的弟兄取利，向借粮的弟兄多要的。且因贪得无餍，欺压邻舍夺取财物，竟忘了我。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 22:13} "Behold, I strike my hand at the dishonest gain that you have made, and at the blood that has been in your midst.
{Eze 22:13} “看哪，我因你所得不义之财和你中间所流的血，就拍掌叹息。
{Eze 22:14} Can your courage endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.
{Eze 22:14} 到了我惩罚你的日子，你的心还能忍受吗？你的手还能有力吗？我耶和华说了这话，就必照着行。
{Eze 22:15} I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries, and I will consume your uncleanness out of you.
{Eze 22:15} 我必将你分散在列国，四散在列邦。我也必从你中间除掉你的污秽。
{Eze 22:16} And you shall be profaned by your own doing in the sight of the nations, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
{Eze 22:16} 你必在列国人的眼前因自己所行的被亵渎，你就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 22:17} And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 22:17} 耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 22:18} "Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace; they are dross of silver.
{Eze 22:18} “人子啊，以色列家在我看为渣滓。他们都是炉中的铜、锡、铁、铅，都是银渣滓。
{Eze 22:19} Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
{Eze 22:19} 所以主耶和华如此说：因你们都成为渣滓，我必聚集你们在耶路撒冷中。
{Eze 22:20} As one gathers silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into a furnace, to blow the fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will put you in and melt you.
{Eze 22:20} 人怎样将银、铜、铁、铅、锡聚在炉中，吹火熔化；照样，我也要发怒气和忿怒，将你们聚集放在城中，熔化你们。
{Eze 22:21} I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst of it.
{Eze 22:21} 我必聚集你们，把我烈怒的火吹在你们身上，你们就在其中熔化。
{Eze 22:22} As silver is melted in a furnace, so you shall be melted in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD; I have poured out my wrath upon you."
{Eze 22:22} 银子怎样熔化在炉中，你们也必照样熔化在城中，你们就知道我耶和华是将忿怒倒在你们身上了。”
{Eze 22:23} And the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 22:23} 耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 22:24} "Son of man, say to her, You are a land that is not cleansed or rained upon in the day of indignation.
{Eze 22:24} “人子啊，你要对这地说：你是未得洁净之地，在恼恨的日子也没有雨下在你以上。
{Eze 22:25} The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst.
{Eze 22:25} 其中的先知同谋背叛，如咆哮的狮子抓撕掠物。他们吞灭人民，抢夺财宝，使这地多有寡妇。
{Eze 22:26} Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have disregarded my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.
{Eze 22:26} 其中的祭司强解我的律法，亵渎我的圣物，不分别圣的和俗的，也不使人分辨洁净的和不洁净的，又遮眼不顾我的安息日；我也在他们中间被亵慢。
{Eze 22:27} Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain.
{Eze 22:27} 其中的首领彷佛豺狼抓撕掠物，杀人流血，伤害人命，要得不义之财。
{Eze 22:28} And her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, 'Thus says the Lord GOD,' when the LORD has not spoken.
{Eze 22:28} 其中的先知为百姓用未泡透的灰抹墙，就是为他们见虚假的异象，用谎诈的占卜，说：‘主耶和华如此说’，其实耶和华没有说。
{Eze 22:29} The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without justice.
{Eze 22:29} 国内众民一味地欺压，惯行抢夺，亏负困苦穷乏的，背理欺压寄居的。
{Eze 22:30} And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none.
{Eze 22:30} 我在他们中间寻找一人重修墙垣，在我面前为这国站在破口防堵，使我不灭绝这国，却找不着一个。
{Eze 22:31} Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 22:31} 所以我将恼恨倒在他们身上，用烈怒的火灭了他们，照他们所行的报应在他们头上。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 23:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 23:1}  耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 23:2}  "Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.
{Eze 23:2}  “人子啊，有两个女子，是一母所生，
{Eze 23:3}  They played the whore in Egypt; they played the whore in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms handled.
{Eze 23:3}  他们在埃及行邪淫，在幼年时行邪淫。他们在那里作处女的时候，有人拥抱他们的怀，抚摸他们的乳。
{Eze 23:4}  Oholah was the name of the elder and Oholibah the name of her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
{Eze 23:4}  他们的名字，姊姊名叫阿荷拉，妹妹名叫阿荷利巴。他们都归于我，生了儿女。论到他们的名字，阿荷拉就是撒玛利亚，阿荷利巴就是耶路撒冷。
{Eze 23:5}  "Oholah played the whore while she was mine, and she lusted after her lovers the Assyrians, warriors
{Eze 23:5}  “阿荷拉归我之后行邪淫，贪恋所爱的人，就是他的邻邦亚述人。
{Eze 23:6}  clothed in purple, governors and commanders, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
{Eze 23:6}  这些人都穿蓝衣，作省长、副省长，都骑着马，是可爱的少年人。
{Eze 23:7}  She bestowed her whoring upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them, and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone after whom she lusted.
{Eze 23:7}  阿荷拉就与亚述人中最美的男子放纵淫行，他因所恋爱之人的一切偶像，玷污自己。
{Eze 23:8}  She did not give up her whoring that she had begun in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their whoring lust upon her.
{Eze 23:8}  自从在埃及的时候，他就没有离开淫乱，因为他年幼作处女的时候，埃及人与他行淫，抚摸他的乳，纵欲与他行淫。
{Eze 23:9}  Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted.
{Eze 23:9}  因此，我将他交在他所爱的人手中，就是他所恋爱的亚述人手中。
{Eze 23:10} These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her daughters; and as for her, they killed her with the sword; and she became a byword among women, when judgment had been executed on her.
{Eze 23:10} 他们就露了他的下体，掳掠他的儿女，用刀杀了他，使他在妇女中留下臭名，因他们向他施行审判。
{Eze 23:11} "Her sister Oholibah saw this, and she became more corrupt than her sister in her lust and in her whoring, which was worse than that of her sister.
{Eze 23:11} “他妹妹阿荷利巴虽然看见了，却还贪恋，比他姊姊更丑；行淫乱比他姊姊更多。
{Eze 23:12} She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.
{Eze 23:12} 他贪恋邻邦的亚述人，就是穿极华美的衣服，骑着马的省长、副省长，都是可爱的少年人。
{Eze 23:13} And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way.
{Eze 23:13} 我看见他被玷污了，他姊妹二人同行一路。
{Eze 23:14} But she carried her whoring further. She saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,
{Eze 23:14} 阿荷利巴又加增淫行，因他看见人像画在墙上，就是用丹色所画迦勒底人的像，
{Eze 23:15} wearing belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them having the appearance of officers, a likeness of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.
{Eze 23:15} 腰间系着带子，头上有下垂的裹头巾，都是军长的形状，仿照巴比伦人的形像；他们的故土就是迦勒底。
{Eze 23:16} When she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
{Eze 23:16} 阿荷利巴一看见就贪恋他们，打发使者往迦勒底去见他们。
{Eze 23:17} And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoring lust. And after she was defiled by them, she turned from them in disgust.
{Eze 23:17} 巴比伦人就来登他爱情的床，与他行淫玷污他。他被玷污，随后心里与他们生疏。
{Eze 23:18} When she carried on her whoring so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned in disgust from her sister.
{Eze 23:18} 这样，他显露淫行，又显露下体；我心就与他生疏，像先前与他姊姊生疏一样。
{Eze 23:19} Yet she increased her whoring, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt
{Eze 23:19} 他还加增他的淫行，追念他幼年在埃及地行邪淫的日子，
{Eze 23:20} and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses.
{Eze 23:20} 贪恋情人身壮精足，如驴如马。
{Eze 23:21} Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom and pressed your young breasts."
{Eze 23:21} 这样，你就想起你幼年的淫行。那时，埃及人拥抱你的怀，抚摸你的乳。”
{Eze 23:22} Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I will stir up against you your lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side:
{Eze 23:22} 阿荷利巴啊，主耶和华如此说：“我必激动你先爱而后生疏的人来攻击你。我必使他们来，在你四围攻击你。
{Eze 23:23} the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.
{Eze 23:23} 所来的就是巴比伦人、迦勒底的众人、比割人、书亚人、哥亚人，同着他们的还有亚述众人，乃是作省长、副省长、作军长有名声的，都骑着马，是可爱的少年人。
{Eze 23:24} And they shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples. They shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.
{Eze 23:24} 他们必带兵器、战车、辎重车，率领大众来攻击你。他们要拿大小盾牌，顶盔摆阵，在你四围攻击你。我要将审判的事交给他们，他们必按着自己的条例审判你。
{Eze 23:25} And I will direct my jealousy against you, that they may deal with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors shall fall by the sword. They shall seize your sons and your daughters, and your survivors shall be devoured by fire.
{Eze 23:25} 我必以忌恨攻击你；他们必以忿怒办你。他们必割去你的鼻子和耳朵；你遗留（或作：余剩；下同）的人必倒在刀下。他们必掳去你的儿女；你所遗留的必被火焚烧。
{Eze 23:26} They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.
{Eze 23:26} 他们必剥去你的衣服，夺取你华美的宝器。
{Eze 23:27} Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your whoring begun in the land of Egypt, so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.
{Eze 23:27} 这样，我必使你的淫行和你从埃及地染来的淫乱止息了，使你不再仰望亚述，也不再追念埃及。
{Eze 23:28} "For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust,
{Eze 23:28} 主耶和华如此说：我必将你交在你所恨恶的人手中，就是你心与他生疏的人手中。
{Eze 23:29} and they shall deal with you in hatred and take away all the fruit of your labor and leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your whoring shall be uncovered. Your lewdness and your whoring
{Eze 23:29} 他们必以恨恶办你，夺取你一切劳碌得来的，留下你赤身露体。你淫乱的下体，连你的淫行，带你的淫乱，都被显露。
{Eze 23:30} have brought this upon you, because you played the whore with the nations and defiled yourself with their idols.
{Eze 23:30} 人必向你行这些事；因为你随从外邦人行邪淫，被他们的偶像玷污了。
{Eze 23:31} You have gone the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.
{Eze 23:31} 你走了你姊姊所走的路，所以我必将他的杯交在你手中。”
{Eze 23:32} Thus says the Lord GOD: "You shall drink your sister's cup that is deep and large; you shall be laughed at and held in derision, for it contains much;
{Eze 23:32} 主耶和华如此说：你必喝你姊姊所喝的杯；那杯又深又广，盛得甚多，使你被人嗤笑讥刺。
{Eze 23:33} you will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. A cup of horror and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria;
{Eze 23:33} 你必酩酊大醉，满有愁苦，喝干你姊姊撒玛利亚的杯，就是令人惊骇凄凉的杯。
{Eze 23:34} you shall drink it and drain it out, and gnaw its shards, and tear your breasts; for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 23:34} 你必喝这杯，以致喝尽。杯破又龈杯片，撕裂自己的乳；因为这事我曾说过。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 23:35} Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you yourself must bear the consequences of your lewdness and whoring."
{Eze 23:35} 主耶和华如此说：“因你忘记我，将我丢在背后，所以你要担当你淫行和淫乱的报应。”
{Eze 23:36} The LORD said to me: "Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Declare to them their abominations.
{Eze 23:36} 耶和华又对我说：“人子啊，你要审问阿荷拉与阿荷利巴吗？当指出他们所行可憎的事。
{Eze 23:37} For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. With their idols they have committed adultery, and they have even offered up to them for food the children whom they had borne to me.
{Eze 23:37} 他们行淫，手中有杀人的血，又与偶像行淫，并使他们为我所生的儿女经火烧给偶像。
{Eze 23:38} Moreover, this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my Sabbaths.
{Eze 23:38} 此外，他们还有向我所行的，就是同日玷污我的圣所，干犯我的安息日。
{Eze 23:39} For when they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. And behold, this is what they did in my house.
{Eze 23:39} 他们杀了儿女献与偶像，当天又入我的圣所，将圣所亵渎了。他们在我殿中所行的乃是如此。
{Eze 23:40} They even sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments.
{Eze 23:40} “况且你们二妇打发使者去请远方人。使者到他们那里，他们就来了。你们为他们沐浴己身，粉饰眼目，佩戴妆饰，
{Eze 23:41} You sat on a stately couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed my incense and my oil.
{Eze 23:41} 坐在华美的床上，前面摆设桌案，将我的香料膏油摆在其上。
{Eze 23:42} The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and with men of the common sort, drunkards were brought from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on the hands of the women, and beautiful crowns on their heads.
{Eze 23:42} 在那里有群众安逸欢乐的声音，并有粗俗的人和酒徒从旷野同来，把镯子戴在二妇的手上，把华冠戴在他们的头上。
{Eze 23:43} "Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery, 'Now they will continue to use her for a whore, even her!'
{Eze 23:43} “我论这行淫衰老的妇人说：现在人还要与他行淫，他也要与人行淫。
{Eze 23:44} For they have gone in to her, as men go in to a prostitute. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, lewd women!
{Eze 23:44} 人与阿荷拉，并阿荷利巴二淫妇苟合，好像与妓女苟合。
{Eze 23:45} But righteous men shall pass judgment on them with the sentence of adulteresses, and with the sentence of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands."
{Eze 23:45} 必有义人，照审判淫妇和流人血的妇人之例，审判他们；因为他们是淫妇，手中有杀人的血。”
{Eze 23:46} For thus says the Lord GOD: "Bring up a vast host against them, and make them an object of terror and a plunder.
{Eze 23:46} 主耶和华如此说：“我必使多人来攻击他们，使他们抛来抛去，被人抢夺。
{Eze 23:47} And the host shall stone them and cut them down with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses.
{Eze 23:47} 这些人必用石头打死他们，用刀剑杀害他们，又杀戮他们的儿女，用火焚烧他们的房屋。
{Eze 23:48} Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done.
{Eze 23:48} 这样，我必使淫行从境内止息，好叫一切妇人都受警戒，不效法你们的淫行。
{Eze 23:49} And they shall return your lewdness upon you, and you shall bear the penalty for your sinful idolatry, and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD."
{Eze 23:49} 人必照着你们的淫行报应你们；你们要担当拜偶像的罪，就知道我是主耶和华。”
{Eze 24:1}  In the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 24:1}  第九年十月初十日，耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 24:2}  "Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
{Eze 24:2}  “人子啊，今日正是巴比伦王就近耶路撒冷的日子，你要将这日记下，
{Eze 24:3}  And utter a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Set on the pot, set it on; pour in water also;
{Eze 24:3}  要向这悖逆之家设比喻说，主耶和华如此说：将锅放在火上，放好了，就倒水在其中；
{Eze 24:4}  put in it the pieces of meat, all the good pieces, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with choice bones.
{Eze 24:4}  将肉块，就是一切肥美的肉块、腿，和肩都聚在其中，拿美好的骨头把锅装满；
{Eze 24:5}  Take the choicest one of the flock; pile the logs under it; boil it well; seethe also its bones in it.
{Eze 24:5}  取羊群中最好的，将柴堆在锅下，使锅开滚，好把骨头煮在其中。
{Eze 24:6}  "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose corrosion is in it, and whose corrosion has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, without making any choice.
{Eze 24:6}  “主耶和华如此说：祸哉！这流人血的城，就是长锈的锅。其中的锈未曾除掉，须要将肉块从其中一一取出来，不必为他拈阄。
{Eze 24:7}  For the blood she has shed is in her midst; she put it on the bare rock; she did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dust.
{Eze 24:7}  城中所流的血倒在净光的磐石上，不倒在地上，用土掩盖。
{Eze 24:8}  To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have set on the bare rock the blood she has shed, that it may not be covered.
{Eze 24:8}  这城中所流的血倒在净光的磐石上，不得掩盖，乃是出于我，为要发忿怒施行报应。
{Eze 24:9}  Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.
{Eze 24:9}  所以主耶和华如此说：祸哉！这流人血的城，我也必大堆火柴，
{Eze 24:10} Heap on the logs, kindle the fire, boil the meat well, mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned up.
{Eze 24:10} 添上木柴，使火着旺，将肉煮烂，把汤熬浓，使骨头烤焦；
{Eze 24:11} Then set it empty upon the coals, that it may become hot, and its copper may burn, that its uncleanness may be melted in it, its corrosion consumed.
{Eze 24:11} 把锅倒空坐在炭火上，使锅烧热，使铜烧红，熔化其中的污秽，除净其上的锈。
{Eze 24:12} She has wearied herself with toil; its abundant corrosion does not go out of it. Into the fire with its corrosion!
{Eze 24:12} 这锅劳碌疲乏，所长的大锈仍未除掉；这锈就是用火也不能除掉。
{Eze 24:13} On account of your unclean lewdness, because I would have cleansed you and you were not cleansed from your uncleanness, you shall not be cleansed anymore till I have satisfied my fury upon you.
{Eze 24:13} 在你污秽中有淫行，我洁净你，你却不洁净。你的污秽再不能洁净，直等我向你发的忿怒止息。
{Eze 24:14} I am the LORD. I have spoken; it shall come to pass; I will do it. I will not go back; I will not spare; I will not relent; according to your ways and your deeds you will be judged, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 24:14} 我耶和华说过的必定成就，必照话而行，必不返回，必不顾惜，也不后悔。人必照你的举动行为审判你。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 24:15} The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 24:15} 耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 24:16} "Son of man, behold, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you at a stroke; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down.
{Eze 24:16} “人子啊，我要将你眼目所喜爱的忽然取去，你却不可悲哀哭泣，也不可流泪，
{Eze 24:17} Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your shoes on your feet; do not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men."
{Eze 24:17} 只可叹息，不可出声，不可办理丧事；头上仍勒裹头巾，脚上仍穿鞋，不可蒙着嘴唇，也不可吃吊丧的食物。”
{Eze 24:18} So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded.
{Eze 24:18} 于是我将这事早晨告诉百姓，晚上我的妻就死了。次日早晨我便遵命而行。
{Eze 24:19} And the people said to me, "Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting thus?"
{Eze 24:19} 百姓问我说：“你这样行与我们有什么关系，你不告诉我们吗？”
{Eze 24:20} Then I said to them, "The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 24:20} 我回答他们：“耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 24:21} 'Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the yearning of your soul, and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.
{Eze 24:21} ‘你告诉以色列家，主耶和华如此说：我必使我的圣所，就是你们势力所夸耀、眼里所喜爱、心中所爱惜的被亵渎，并且你们所遗留的儿女必倒在刀下。
{Eze 24:22} And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
{Eze 24:22} 那时，你们必行我仆人所行的，不蒙着嘴唇，也不吃吊丧的食物。
{Eze 24:23} Your turbans shall be on your heads and your shoes on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but you shall rot away in your iniquities and groan to one another.
{Eze 24:23} 你们仍要头上勒裹头巾，脚上穿鞋；不可悲哀哭泣。你们必因自己的罪孽相对叹息，渐渐消灭。
{Eze 24:24} Thus shall Ezekiel be to you a sign; according to all that he has done you shall do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.'
{Eze 24:24} 以西结必这样为你们作预兆；凡他所行的，你们也必照样行。那事来到，你们就知道我是主耶和华。’
{Eze 24:25} "As for you, son of man, surely on the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their soul's desire, and also their sons and daughters,
{Eze 24:25} “人子啊，我除掉他们所倚靠、所欢喜的荣耀，并眼中所喜爱、心里所重看的儿女。
{Eze 24:26} on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news.
{Eze 24:26} 那日逃脱的人岂不来到你这里，使你耳闻这事吗？
{Eze 24:27} On that day your mouth will be opened to the fugitive, and you shall speak and be no longer mute. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD."
{Eze 24:27} 你必向逃脱的人开口说话，不再哑口。你必这样为他们作预兆，他们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 25:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 25:1}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 25:2}  "Son of man, set your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
{Eze 25:2}  “人子啊，你要面向亚扪人说预言，攻击他们，
{Eze 25:3}  Say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Because you said, 'Aha!' over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile,
{Eze 25:3}  说：你们当听主耶和华的话。主耶和华如此说：我的圣所被亵渎，以色列地变荒凉，犹大家被掳掠；那时，你便因这些事说：‘阿哈！’
{Eze 25:4}  therefore behold, I am handing you over to the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings in your midst. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
{Eze 25:4}  所以我必将你的地交给东方人为业；他们必在你的地上安营居住，吃你的果子，喝你的奶。
{Eze 25:5}  I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a fold for flocks. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 25:5}  我必使拉巴为骆驼场，使亚扪人的地为羊群躺卧之处，你们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 25:6}  For thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the malice within your soul against the land of Israel,
{Eze 25:6}  主耶和华如此说：“因你拍手顿足，以满心的恨恶向以色列地欢喜，
{Eze 25:7}  therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand against you, and will hand you over as plunder to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples and will make you perish out of the countries; I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 25:7}  所以我伸手攻击你，将你交给列国作为掳物。我必从万民中剪除你，使你从万国中败亡。我必除灭你，你就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 25:8}  "Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Moab and Seir said, 'Behold, the house of Judah is like all the other nations,'
{Eze 25:8}  主耶和华如此说：“因摩押和西珥人说：‘看哪，犹大家与列国无异’，
{Eze 25:9}  therefore I will lay open the flank of Moab from the cities, from its cities on its frontier, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim.
{Eze 25:9}  所以我要破开摩押边界上的城邑，就是摩押人看为本国之荣耀的伯耶西末、巴力免、基列亭，
{Eze 25:10} I will give it along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, that the Ammonites may be remembered no more among the nations,
{Eze 25:10} 好使东方人来攻击亚扪人。我必将亚扪人之地交给他们为业，使亚扪人在列国中不再被记念。
{Eze 25:11} and I will execute judgments upon Moab. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 25:11} 我必向摩押施行审判，他们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 25:12} "Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Edom acted revengefully against the house of Judah and has grievously offended in taking vengeance on them,
{Eze 25:12} 主耶和华如此说：“因为以东报仇雪恨，攻击犹大家，向他们报仇，大大有罪，
{Eze 25:13} therefore thus says the Lord GOD, I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it man and beast. And I will make it desolate; from Teman even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.
{Eze 25:13} 所以主耶和华如此说：我必伸手攻击以东，剪除人与牲畜，使以东从提幔起，人必倒在刀下，地要变为荒凉，直到底但。
{Eze 25:14} And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath, and they shall know my vengeance, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 25:14} 我必藉我民以色列的手报复以东；以色列民必照我的怒气，按我的忿怒在以东施报，以东人就知道是我施报。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 25:15} "Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the Philistines acted revengefully and took vengeance with malice of soul to destroy in never-ending enmity,
{Eze 25:15} 主耶和华如此说：“因非利士人向犹大人报仇，就是以恨恶的心报仇雪恨，永怀仇恨，要毁灭他们，
{Eze 25:16} therefore thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the rest of the seacoast.
{Eze 25:16} 所以主耶和华如此说：我必伸手攻击非利士人，剪除基利提人，灭绝沿海剩下的居民。
{Eze 25:17} I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I lay my vengeance upon them."
{Eze 25:17} 我向他们大施报应，发怒斥责他们。我报复他们的时候，他们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 26:1}  In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 26:1}  第十一年十一月初一日，耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 26:2}  "Son of man, because Tyre said concerning Jerusalem, 'Aha, the gate of the peoples is broken; it has swung open to me. I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste,'
{Eze 26:2}  “人子啊，因推罗向耶路撒冷说：‘阿哈，那作众民之门的已经破坏，向我开放；他既变为荒场，我必丰盛。’
{Eze 26:3}  therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.
{Eze 26:3}  所以，主耶和华如此说：推罗啊，我必与你为敌，使许多国民上来攻击你，如同海使波浪涌上来一样。
{Eze 26:4}  They shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers, and I will scrape her soil from her and make her a bare rock.
{Eze 26:4}  他们必破坏推罗的墙垣，拆毁他的城楼。我也要刮净尘土，使他成为净光的磐石。
{Eze 26:5}  She shall be in the midst of the sea a place for the spreading of nets, for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD. And she shall become plunder for the nations,
{Eze 26:5}  他必在海中作晒网的地方，也必成为列国的掳物。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 26:6}  and her daughters on the mainland shall be killed by the sword. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 26:6}  属推罗城邑的居民（原文作田间的众女；八节同）必被刀剑杀灭，他们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 26:7}  "For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, and with horsemen and a host of many soldiers.
{Eze 26:7}  主耶和华如此说：“我必使诸王之王的巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒率领马匹车辆、马兵、军队，和许多人民从北方来攻击你推罗。
{Eze 26:8}  He will kill with the sword your daughters on the mainland. He will set up a siege wall against you and throw up a mound against you, and raise a roof of shields against you.
{Eze 26:8}  他必用刀剑杀灭属你城邑的居民，也必造台筑垒举盾牌攻击你。
{Eze 26:9}  He will direct the shock of his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.
{Eze 26:9}  他必安设撞城锤攻破你的墙垣，用铁器拆毁你的城楼。
{Eze 26:10} His horses will be so many that their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen and wagons and chariots, when he enters your gates as men enter a city that has been breached.
{Eze 26:10} 因他的马匹众多，尘土扬起遮蔽你。他进入你的城门，好像人进入已有破口之城。那时，你的墙垣必因骑马的和战车、辎重车的响声震动。

{Eze 28:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 28:1}  耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 28:2}  "Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Because your heart is proud, and you have said, 'I am a god, I sit in the seat of the gods, in the heart of the seas,' yet you are but a man, and no god, though you make your heart like the heart of a god--
{Eze 28:2}  “人子啊，你对推罗君王说，主耶和华如此说：因你心里高傲，说：我是神；我在海中坐神之位。你虽然居心自比神，也不过是人，并不是神！
{Eze 28:3}  you are indeed wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you;
{Eze 28:3}  看哪，你比但以理更有智慧，什么秘事都不能向你隐藏。
{Eze 28:4}  by your wisdom and your understanding you have made wealth for yourself, and have gathered gold and silver into your treasuries;
{Eze 28:4}  你靠自己的智慧聪明得了金银财宝，收入库中。
{Eze 28:5}  by your great wisdom in your trade you have increased your wealth, and your heart has become proud in your wealth--
{Eze 28:5}  你靠自己的大智慧和贸易增添资财，又因资财心里高傲。
{Eze 28:6}  therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you make your heart like the heart of a god,
{Eze 28:6}  所以主耶和华如此说：因你居心自比神，
{Eze 28:7}  therefore, behold, I will bring foreigners upon you, the most ruthless of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and defile your splendor.
{Eze 28:7}  我必使外邦人，就是列国中的强暴人临到你这里；他们必拔刀砍坏你用智慧得来的美物，亵渎你的荣光。
{Eze 28:8}  They shall thrust you down into the pit, and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas.
{Eze 28:8}  他们必使你下坑；你必死在海中，与被杀的人一样。
{Eze 28:9}  Will you still say, 'I am a god,' in the presence of those who kill you, though you are but a man, and no god, in the hands of those who slay you?
{Eze 28:9}  在杀你的人面前你还能说“我是神”吗？其实你在杀害你的人手中，不过是人，并不是神。
{Eze 28:10} You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners; for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 28:10} 你必死在外邦人手中，与未受割礼（或作：不洁；下同）的人一样，因为这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 28:11} Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 28:11} 耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 28:12} "Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord GOD: "You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
{Eze 28:12} “人子啊，你为推罗王作起哀歌，说主耶和华如此说：你无所不备，智慧充足，全然美丽。
{Eze 28:13} You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle; and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day that you were created they were prepared.
{Eze 28:13} 你曾在伊甸神的园中，佩戴各样宝石，就是红宝石、红璧玺、金钢石、水苍玉、红玛瑙、碧玉、蓝宝石、绿宝石、红玉，和黄金；又有精美的鼓笛在你那里，都是在你受造之日预备齐全的。
{Eze 28:14} You were an anointed guardian cherub. I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire you walked.
{Eze 28:14} 你是那受膏遮掩约柜的基路伯；我将你安置在神的圣山上；你在发光如火的宝石中间往来。
{Eze 28:15} You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created, till unrighteousness was found in you.
{Eze 28:15} 你从受造之日所行的都完全，后来在你中间又察出不义。
{Eze 28:16} In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence in your midst, and you sinned; so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O guardian cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
{Eze 28:16} 因你贸易很多，就被强暴的事充满，以致犯罪，所以我因你亵渎圣地，就从神的山驱逐你。遮掩约柜的基路伯啊，我已将你从发光如火的宝石中除灭。
{Eze 28:17} Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I exposed you before kings, to feast their eyes on you.
{Eze 28:17} 你因美丽心中高傲，又因荣光败坏智慧，我已将你摔倒在地，使你倒在君王面前，好叫他们目睹眼见。
{Eze 28:18} By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your trade you profaned your sanctuaries; so I brought fire out from your midst; it consumed you, and I turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all who saw you.
{Eze 28:18} 你因罪孽众多，贸易不公，就亵渎你那里的圣所。故此，我使火从你中间发出，烧灭你，使你在所有观看的人眼前变为地上的炉灰。
{Eze 28:19} All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you; you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever."
{Eze 28:19} 各国民中，凡认识你的，都必为你惊奇。你令人惊恐，不再存留于世，直到永远。”
{Eze 28:20} The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 28:20} 耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 28:21} "Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her
{Eze 28:21} “人子啊，你要向西顿预言攻击他，
{Eze 28:22} and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, and I will manifest my glory in your midst. And they shall know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in her and manifest my holiness in her;
{Eze 28:22} 说主耶和华如此说：西顿哪，我与你为敌，我必在你中间得荣耀。我在你中间施行审判、显为圣的时候，人就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 28:23} for I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the slain shall fall in her midst, by the sword that is against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 28:23} 我必使瘟疫进入西顿，使血流在他街上。被杀的必在其中仆倒，四围有刀剑临到他，人就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 28:24} "And for the house of Israel there shall be no more a brier to prick or a thorn to hurt them among all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.
{Eze 28:24} “四围恨恶以色列家的人，必不再向他们作刺人的荆棘，伤人的蒺藜，人就知道我是主耶和华。”
{Eze 28:25} "Thus says the Lord GOD: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations, then they shall dwell in their own land that I gave to my servant Jacob.
{Eze 28:25} 主耶和华如此说：“我将分散在万民中的以色列家招聚回来，向他们在列邦人眼前显为圣的时候，他们就在我赐给我仆人雅各之地，仍然居住。
{Eze 28:26} And they shall dwell securely in it, and they shall build houses and plant vineyards. They shall dwell securely, when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God."
{Eze 28:26} 他们要在这地上安然居住。我向四围恨恶他们的众人施行审判以后，他们要盖造房屋，栽种葡萄园，安然居住，就知道我是耶和华他们的神。”
{Eze 29:1}  In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 29:1}  第十年十月十二日，耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 29:2}  "Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt;
{Eze 29:2}  “人子啊，你要向埃及王法老预言攻击他和埃及全地，
{Eze 29:3}  speak, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the midst of his streams, that says, 'My Nile is my own; I made it for myself.'
{Eze 29:3}  说主耶和华如此说：埃及王法老啊，我与你这卧在自己河中的大鱼为敌。你曾说：这河是我的，是我为自己造的。
{Eze 29:4}  I will put hooks in your jaws, and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales; and I will draw you up out of the midst of your streams, with all the fish of your streams that stick to your scales.
{Eze 29:4}  我耶和华必用钩子钩住你的腮颊，又使江河中的鱼贴住你的鳞甲；我必将你和所有贴住你鳞甲的鱼，从江河中拉上来，
{Eze 29:5}  And I will cast you out into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your streams; you shall fall on the open field, and not be brought together or gathered. To the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens I give you as food.
{Eze 29:5}  把你并江河中的鱼都抛在旷野；你必倒在田间，不被收殓，不被掩埋。我已将你给地上野兽、空中飞鸟作食物。
{Eze 29:6}  Then all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD. "Because you have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel,
{Eze 29:6}  “埃及一切的居民，因向以色列家成了芦苇的杖，就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 29:7}  when they grasped you with the hand, you broke and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke and made all their loins to shake.
{Eze 29:7}  他们用手持住你，你就断折，伤了他们的肩；他们倚靠你，你就断折，闪了他们的腰。
{Eze 29:8}  Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and will cut off from you man and beast,
{Eze 29:8}  所以主耶和华如此说：我必使刀剑临到你，从你中间将人与牲畜剪除。
{Eze 29:9}  and the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste. Then they will know that I am the LORD. "Because you said, 'The Nile is mine, and I made it,'
{Eze 29:9}  埃及地必荒废凄凉，他们就知道我是耶和华。“因为法老说：‘这河是我的，是我所造的’，
{Eze 29:10} therefore, behold, I am against you and against your streams, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Cush.
{Eze 29:10} 所以我必与你并你的江河为敌，使埃及地，从色弗尼塔直到古实境界，全然荒废凄凉。
{Eze 29:11} No foot of man shall pass through it, and no foot of beast shall pass through it; it shall be uninhabited forty years.
{Eze 29:11} 人的脚、兽的蹄都不经过，四十年之久并无人居住。
{Eze 29:12} And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries, and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries.
{Eze 29:12} 我必使埃及地在荒凉的国中成为荒凉，使埃及城在荒废的城中变为荒废，共有四十年。我必将埃及人分散在列国，四散在列邦。”
{Eze 29:13} "For thus says the Lord GOD: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered,
{Eze 29:13} 主耶和华如此说：“满了四十年，我必招聚分散在各国民中的埃及人。
{Eze 29:14} and I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin, and there they shall be a lowly kingdom.
{Eze 29:14} 我必叫埃及被掳的人回来，使他们归回本地巴忒罗。在那里必成为低微的国，
{Eze 29:15} It shall be the most lowly of the kingdoms, and never again exalt itself above the nations. And I will make them so small that they will never again rule over the nations.
{Eze 29:15} 必为列国中最低微的，也不再自高于列国之上。我必减少他们，以致不再辖制列国。
{Eze 29:16} And it shall never again be the reliance of the house of Israel, recalling their iniquity, when they turn to them for aid. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD."
{Eze 29:16} 埃及必不再作以色列家所倚靠的；以色列家仰望埃及人的时候，便思念罪孽。他们就知道我是主耶和华。”
{Eze 29:17} In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 29:17} 二十七年正月初一日，耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 29:18} "Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre. Every head was made bald, and every shoulder was rubbed bare, yet neither he nor his army got anything from Tyre to pay for the labor that he had performed against her.
{Eze 29:18} “人子啊，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒使他的军兵大大效劳，攻打推罗，以致头都光秃，肩都磨破；然而他和他的军兵攻打推罗，并没有从那里得什么酬劳。
{Eze 29:19} Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off its wealth and despoil it and plunder it; and it shall be the wages for his army.
{Eze 29:19} 所以主耶和华如此说：我必将埃及地赐给巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒；他必掳掠埃及群众，抢其中的财为掳物，夺其中的货为掠物，这就可以作他军兵的酬劳。
{Eze 29:20} I have given him the land of Egypt as his payment for which he labored, because they worked for me, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 29:20} 我将埃及地赐给他，酬他所效的劳，因王与军兵是为我勤劳。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 29:21} "On that day I will cause a horn to spring up for the house of Israel, and I will open your lips among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
{Eze 29:21} “当那日，我必使以色列家的角发生，又必使你以西结在他们中间得以开口；他们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 30:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 30:1}  耶和华的话又临到我说：

{Eze 30:20} In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:

{Eze 30:21} "Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and behold, it has not been bound up, to heal it by binding it with a bandage, so that it may become strong to wield the sword.
{Eze 30:21} “人子啊，我已打折埃及王法老的膀臂；没有敷药，也没有用布缠好，使他有力持刀。

{Eze 30:22} 所以主耶和华如此说：看哪，我与埃及王法老为敌，必将他有力的膀臂和已打折的膀臂全行打断，使刀从他手中坠落。
{Eze 30:23} I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries.
{Eze 30:23} 我必将埃及人分散在列国，四散在列邦。

{Eze 31:1}  In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 31:1}  十一年三月初一日，耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 31:2}  "Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude: "Whom are you like in your greatness?
{Eze 31:2}  “人子啊，你要向埃及王法老和他的众人说：在威势上谁能与你相比呢？
{Eze 31:3}  Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches and forest shade, and of towering height, its top among the clouds.
{Eze 31:3}  亚述王曾如利巴嫩中的香柏树，枝条荣美，影密如林，极其高大，树尖插入云中。
{Eze 31:4}  The waters nourished it; the deep made it grow tall, making its rivers flow around the place of its planting, sending forth its streams to all the trees of the field.
{Eze 31:4}  众水使他生长；深水使他长大。所栽之地有江河围流，汊出的水道延到田野诸树。
{Eze 31:5}  So it towered high above all the trees of the field; its boughs grew large and its branches long from abundant water in its shoots.
{Eze 31:5}  所以他高大超过田野诸树；发旺的时候，枝子繁多，因得大水之力枝条长长。
{Eze 31:6}  All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth to their young, and under its shadow lived all great nations.
{Eze 31:6}  空中的飞鸟都在枝子上搭窝；田野的走兽都在枝条下生子；所有大国的人民都在他荫下居住。
{Eze 31:7}  It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its roots went down to abundant waters.
{Eze 31:7}  树大条长，成为荣美，因为根在众水之旁。
{Eze 31:8}  The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor the fir trees equal its boughs; neither were the plane trees like its branches; no tree in the garden of God was its equal in beauty.
{Eze 31:8}  神园中的香柏树不能遮蔽他；松树不及他的枝子；枫树不及他的枝条；神园中的树都没有他荣美。
{Eze 31:9}  I made it beautiful in the mass of its branches, and all the trees of Eden envied it, that were in the garden of God.
{Eze 31:9}  我使他的枝条蕃多，成为荣美，以致神伊甸园中的树都嫉妒他。”
{Eze 31:10} "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because it towered high and set its top among the clouds, and its heart was proud of its height,
{Eze 31:10} 所以主耶和华如此说：“因他高大，树尖插入云中，心骄气傲，
{Eze 31:11} I will give it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations. He shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves. I have cast it out.
{Eze 31:11} 我就必将他交给列国中大有威势的人；他必定办他。我因他的罪恶，已经驱逐他。
{Eze 31:12} Foreigners, the most ruthless of nations, have cut it down and left it. On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen, and its boughs have been broken in all the ravines of the land, and all the peoples of the earth have gone away from its shadow and left it.
{Eze 31:12} 外邦人，就是列邦中强暴的，将他砍断弃掉。他的枝条落在山间和一切谷中，他的枝子折断，落在地的一切河旁。地上的众民已经走去，离开他的荫下。
{Eze 31:13} On its fallen trunk dwell all the birds of the heavens, and on its branches are all the beasts of the field.
{Eze 31:13} 空中的飞鸟都要宿在这败落的树上，田野的走兽都要卧在他的枝条下，
{Eze 31:14} All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to towering height or set their tops among the clouds, and that no trees that drink water may reach up to them in height. For they are all given over to death, to the world below, among the children of man, with those who go down to the pit.
{Eze 31:14} 好使水旁的诸树不因高大而自尊，也不将树尖插入云中，并且那些得水滋润、有势力的，也不得高大自立。因为他们在世人中，和下坑的人都被交与死亡，到阴府去了。”
{Eze 31:15} "Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day the cedar went down to Sheol I caused mourning; I closed the deep over it, and restrained its rivers, and many waters were stopped. I clothed Lebanon in gloom for it, and all the trees of the field fainted because of it.
{Eze 31:15} 主耶和华如此说：“他下阴间的那日，我便使人悲哀。我为他遮盖深渊，使江河凝结，大水停流；我也使利巴嫩为他凄惨，田野的诸树都因他发昏。
{Eze 31:16} I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to Sheol with those who go down to the pit. And all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the world below.
{Eze 31:16} 我将他扔到阴间，与下坑的人一同下去。那时，列国听见他坠落的响声就都震动，并且伊甸的一切树就是利巴嫩得水滋润、最佳最美的树都在阴府受了安慰。
{Eze 31:17} They also went down to Sheol with it, to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were its arm, who lived under its shadow among the nations.
{Eze 31:17} 他们也与他同下阴间，到被杀的人那里。他们曾作他的膀臂，在列国中他的荫下居住。
{Eze 31:18} "Whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? You shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the world below. You shall lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword. "This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 31:18} 在这样荣耀威势上，在伊甸园诸树中，谁能与你相比呢？然而你要与伊甸的诸树一同下到阴府，在未受割礼的人中，与被杀的人一同躺卧。“法老和他的群众乃是如此。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 32:1}  In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 32:1}  十二年十二月初一日，耶和华的话临到我说：

{Eze 32:2}  “人子啊，你要为埃及王法老作哀歌，说：从前你在列国中，如同少壮狮子；现在你却像海中的大鱼。你冲出江河，用爪搅动诸水，使江河浑浊。
{Eze 32:3}  Thus says the Lord GOD: I will throw my net over you with a host of many peoples, and they will haul you up in my dragnet.
{Eze 32:3}  主耶和华如此说：我必用多国的人民，将我的网撒在你身上，把你拉上来。

{Eze 32:6}  我又必用你的血浇灌你所游泳之地，漫过山顶；河道都必充满。

{Eze 32:7}  我将你扑灭的时候，要把天遮蔽，使众星昏暗，以密云遮掩太阳，月亮也不放光。
{Eze 32:8}  All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you, and put darkness on your land, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 32:8}  我必使天上的亮光都在你以上变为昏暗，使你的地上黑暗。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 32:9}  "I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries that you have not known.
{Eze 32:9}  “我使你败亡的风声传到你所不认识的各国。那时，我必使多民的心因你愁烦。
{Eze 32:10} I will make many peoples appalled at you, and the hair of their kings shall bristle with horror because of you, when I brandish my sword before them. They shall tremble every moment, every one for his own life, on the day of your downfall.
{Eze 32:10} 我在许多国民和君王面前向你抡我的刀，国民就必因你惊奇，君王也必因你极其恐慌。在你仆倒的日子，他们各人为自己的性命时刻战兢。”
{Eze 32:11} "For thus says the Lord GOD: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.
{Eze 32:11} 主耶和华如此说：“巴比伦王的刀必临到你。
{Eze 32:12} I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of mighty ones, all of them most ruthless of nations. "They shall bring to ruin the pride of Egypt, and all its multitude shall perish.
{Eze 32:12} 我必藉勇士的刀使你的众民仆倒；这勇士都是列国中强暴的。他们必使埃及的骄傲归于无有；埃及的众民必被灭绝。
{Eze 32:13} I will destroy all its beasts from beside many waters; and no foot of man shall trouble them anymore, nor shall the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
{Eze 32:13} 我必从埃及多水旁除灭所有的走兽；人脚兽蹄必不再搅浑这水。
{Eze 32:14} Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 32:14} 那时，我必使埃及河澄清，江河像油缓流。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 32:15} When I make the land of Egypt desolate, and when the land is desolate of all that fills it, when I strike down all who dwell in it, then they will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 32:15} 我使埃及地变为荒废凄凉；这地缺少从前所充满的，又击杀其中一切的居民。那时，他们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 32:16} This is a lamentation that shall be chanted; the daughters of the nations shall chant it; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they chant it, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 32:16} “人必用这哀歌去哀哭，列国的女子为埃及和他的群众也必以此悲哀。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 32:17} In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 32:17} 十二年十二月十五日，耶和华的话临到我说：

{Eze 32:18} “人子啊，你要为埃及群众哀号，又要将埃及和有名之国的女子，并下坑的人，一同扔到阴府去。
{Eze 32:19} 'Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down and be laid to rest with the uncircumcised.'
{Eze 32:19} 你埃及的美丽胜过谁呢？你下去与未受割礼的人一同躺卧吧！

{Eze 33:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 33:1}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 33:2}  "Son of man, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and make him their watchman,
{Eze 33:2}  “人子啊，你要告诉本国的子民说：我使刀剑临到哪一国，那一国的民从他们中间选立一人为守望的。
{Eze 33:3}  and if he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people,
{Eze 33:3}  他见刀剑临到那地，若吹角警戒众民，
{Eze 33:4}  then if anyone who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
{Eze 33:4}  凡听见角声不受警戒的，刀剑若来除灭了他，他的罪（原文作血）就必归到自己的头上。
{Eze 33:5}  He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have saved his life.
{Eze 33:5}  他听见角声，不受警戒，他的罪必归到自己的身上；他若受警戒，便是救了自己的性命。
{Eze 33:6}  But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any one of them, that person is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman's hand.
{Eze 33:6}  倘若守望的人见刀剑临到，不吹角，以致民不受警戒，刀剑来杀了他们中间的一个人，他虽然死在罪孽之中，我却要向守望的人讨他丧命的罪（原文作血）。
{Eze 33:7}  "So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.
{Eze 33:7}  “人子啊，我照样立你作以色列家守望的人。所以你要听我口中的话，替我警戒他们。
{Eze 33:8}  If I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
{Eze 33:8}  我对恶人说：‘恶人哪，你必要死！’你以西结若不开口警戒恶人，使他离开所行的道，这恶人必死在罪孽之中，我却要向你讨他丧命的罪（原文作血）。
{Eze 33:9}  But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that person shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.
{Eze 33:9}  倘若你警戒恶人转离所行的道，他仍不转离，他必死在罪孽之中，你却救自己脱离了罪。”
{Eze 33:10} "And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus have you said: 'Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we rot away because of them. How then can we live?'
{Eze 33:10} “人子啊，你要对以色列家说：‘你们常说：我们的过犯罪恶在我们身上，我们必因此消灭，怎能存活呢？’
{Eze 33:11} Say to them, As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel?
{Eze 33:11} 你对他们说，主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，我断不喜悦恶人死亡，惟喜悦恶人转离所行的道而活。以色列家啊，你们转回，转回吧！离开恶道，何必死亡呢？
{Eze 33:12} "And you, son of man, say to your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him when he transgresses, and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it when he turns from his wickedness, and the righteous shall not be able to live by his righteousness when he sins.
{Eze 33:12} 人子啊，你要对本国的人民说：义人的义，在犯罪之日不能救他；至于恶人的恶，在他转离恶行之日也不能使他倾倒；义人在犯罪之日也不能因他的义存活。
{Eze 33:13} Though I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, yet if he trusts in his righteousness and does injustice, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered, but in his injustice that he has done he shall die.
{Eze 33:13} 我对义人说：‘你必定存活！’他若倚靠他的义而作罪孽，他所行的义都不被记念。他必因所作的罪孽死亡。
{Eze 33:14} Again, though I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' yet if he turns from his sin and does what is just and right,
{Eze 33:14} 再者，我对恶人说：‘你必定死亡！’他若转离他的罪，行正直与合理的事：
{Eze 33:15} if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has taken by robbery, and walks in the statutes of life, not doing injustice, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
{Eze 33:15} 还人的当头和所抢夺的，遵行生命的律例，不作罪孽，他必定存活，不至死亡。
{Eze 33:16} None of the sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him. He has done what is just and right; he shall surely live.
{Eze 33:16} 他所犯的一切罪必不被记念。他行了正直与合理的事，必定存活。
{Eze 33:17} "Yet your people say, 'The way of the Lord is not just,' when it is their own way that is not just.
{Eze 33:17} “你本国的子民还说：‘主的道不公平。’其实他们的道不公平。
{Eze 33:18} When the righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it.
{Eze 33:18} 义人转离他的义而作罪孽，就必因此死亡。
{Eze 33:19} And when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he shall live by this.
{Eze 33:19} 恶人转离他的恶，行正直与合理的事，就必因此存活。
{Eze 33:20} Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his ways."
{Eze 33:20} 你们还说：‘主的道不公平。’以色列家啊，我必按你们各人所行的审判你们。”
{Eze 33:21} In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me and said, "The city has been struck down."
{Eze 33:21} 我们被掳之后十二年十月初五日，有人从耶路撒冷逃到我这里，说：“城已攻破。”
{Eze 33:22} Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the fugitive came; and he had opened my mouth by the time the man came to me in the morning, so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.
{Eze 33:22} 逃来的人未到前一日的晚上，耶和华的灵（原文作手）降在我身上，开我的口。到第二日早晨，那人来到我这里，我口就开了，不再缄默。
{Eze 33:23} The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 33:23} 耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 33:24} "Son of man, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of Israel keep saying, 'Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land; but we are many; the land is surely given us to possess.'
{Eze 33:24} “人子啊，住在以色列荒废之地的人说：‘亚伯拉罕独自一人能得这地为业，我们人数众多，这地更是给我们为业的。’
{Eze 33:25} Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: You eat flesh with the blood and lift up your eyes to your idols and shed blood; shall you then possess the land?
{Eze 33:25} 所以你要对他们说，主耶和华如此说：你们吃带血的物，仰望偶像，并且杀人流血，你们还能得这地为业吗？
{Eze 33:26} You rely on the sword, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife; shall you then possess the land?
{Eze 33:26} 你们倚仗自己的刀剑行可憎的事，人人玷污邻舍的妻，你们还能得这地为业吗？
{Eze 33:27} Say this to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword, and whoever is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in strongholds and in caves shall die by pestilence.
{Eze 33:27} 你要对他们这样说，主耶和华如此说：我指着我的永生起誓，在荒场中的，必倒在刀下；在田野间的，必交给野兽吞吃；在保障和洞里的，必遭瘟疫而死。
{Eze 33:28} And I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and her proud might shall come to an end, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that none will pass through.
{Eze 33:28} 我必使这地荒凉，令人惊骇；他因势力而有的骄傲也必止息。以色列的山都必荒凉，无人经过。
{Eze 33:29} Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed.
{Eze 33:29} 我因他们所行一切可憎的事使地荒凉，令人惊骇。那时，他们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 33:30} "As for you, son of man, your people who talk together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, say to one another, each to his brother, 'Come, and hear what the word is that comes from the LORD.'
{Eze 33:30} “人子啊，你本国的子民在墙垣旁边、在房屋门口谈论你。弟兄对弟兄彼此说：‘来吧！听听有什么话从耶和华而出。’
{Eze 33:31} And they come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear what you say but they will not do it; for with lustful talk in their mouths they act; their heart is set on their gain.
{Eze 33:31} 他们来到你这里如同民来聚会，坐在你面前彷佛是我的民。他们听你的话却不去行；因为他们的口多显爱情，心却追随财利。
{Eze 33:32} And behold, you are to them like one who sings lustful songs with a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument, for they hear what you say, but they will not do it.
{Eze 33:32} 他们看你如善于奏乐、声音幽雅之人所唱的雅歌，他们听你的话却不去行。
{Eze 33:33} When this comes--and come it will!--then they will know that a prophet has been among them."
{Eze 33:33} 看哪，所说的快要应验；应验了，他们就知道在他们中间有了先知。”
{Eze 34:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 34:1}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 34:2}  "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord GOD: Ah, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?
{Eze 34:2}  “人子啊，你要向以色列的牧人发预言，攻击他们，说，主耶和华如此说：祸哉！以色列的牧人只知牧养自己。牧人岂不当牧养群羊吗？
{Eze 34:3}  You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep.
{Eze 34:3}  你们吃脂油、穿羊毛、宰肥壮的，却不牧养群羊。
{Eze 34:4}  The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the injured you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them.
{Eze 34:4}  瘦弱的，你们没有养壮；有病的，你们没有医治；受伤的，你们没有缠裹；被逐的，你们没有领回；失丧的，你们没有寻找；但用强暴严严地辖制。
{Eze 34:5}  So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd, and they became food for all the wild beasts. My sheep were scattered;
{Eze 34:5}  因无牧人，羊就分散；既分散，便作了一切野兽的食物。
{Eze 34:6}  they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with none to search or seek for them.
{Eze 34:6}  我的羊在诸山间、在各高冈上流离，在全地上分散，无人去寻，无人去找。
{Eze 34:7}  "Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
{Eze 34:7}  “所以，你们这些牧人要听耶和华的话。
{Eze 34:8}  As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd, and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep,
{Eze 34:8}  主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，我的羊因无牧人就成为掠物，也作了一切野兽的食物。我的牧人不寻找我的羊；这些牧人只知牧养自己，并不牧养我的羊。
{Eze 34:9}  therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
{Eze 34:9}  所以你们这些牧人要听耶和华的话。
{Eze 34:10} Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my sheep at their hand and put a stop to their feeding the sheep. No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, that they may not be food for them.
{Eze 34:10} 主耶和华如此说：我必与牧人为敌，必向他们的手追讨我的羊，使他们不再牧放群羊；牧人也不再牧养自己。我必救我的羊脱离他们的口，不再作他们的食物。”
{Eze 34:11} "For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out.
{Eze 34:11} “主耶和华如此说：看哪，我必亲自寻找我的羊，将他们寻见。
{Eze 34:12} As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.
{Eze 34:12} 牧人在羊群四散的日子怎样寻找他的羊，我必照样寻找我的羊。这些羊在密云黑暗的日子散到各处，我必从那里救回他们来。
{Eze 34:13} And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
{Eze 34:13} 我必从万民中领出他们，从各国内聚集他们，引导他们归回故土，也必在以色列山上一切溪水旁边、境内一切可居之处牧养他们。
{Eze 34:14} I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land. There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel.
{Eze 34:14} 我必在美好的草场牧养他们。他们的圈必在以色列高处的山上，他们必在佳美之圈中躺卧，也在以色列山肥美的草场吃草。
{Eze 34:15} I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 34:15} 主耶和华说：我必亲自作我羊的牧人，使他们得以躺卧。
{Eze 34:16} I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.
{Eze 34:16} 失丧的，我必寻找；被逐的，我必领回；受伤的，我必缠裹；有病的，我必医治；只是肥的壮的，我必除灭，也要秉公牧养他们。
{Eze 34:17} "As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and male goats.
{Eze 34:17} “我的羊群哪，论到你们，主耶和华如此说：我必在羊与羊中间、公绵羊与公山羊中间施行判断。
{Eze 34:18} Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet?
{Eze 34:18} 你们这些肥壮的羊，在美好的草场吃草还以为小事吗？剩下的草，你们竟用蹄践踏了；你们喝清水，剩下的水，你们竟用蹄搅浑了。
{Eze 34:19} And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?
{Eze 34:19} 至于我的羊，只得吃你们所践踏的，喝你们所搅浑的。
{Eze 34:20} "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: Behold, I, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
{Eze 34:20} “所以，主耶和华如此说：我必在肥羊和瘦羊中间施行判断。
{Eze 34:21} Because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad,
{Eze 34:21} 因为你们用胁用肩拥挤一切瘦弱的，又用角抵触，以致使他们四散。
{Eze 34:22} I will rescue my flock; they shall no longer be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep.
{Eze 34:22} 所以，我必拯救我的群羊不再作掠物；我也必在羊和羊中间施行判断。
{Eze 34:23} And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.
{Eze 34:23} 我必立一牧人照管他们，牧养他们，就是我的仆人大卫。他必牧养他们，作他们的牧人。
{Eze 34:24} And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them. I am the LORD; I have spoken.
{Eze 34:24} 我耶和华必作他们的神，我的仆人大卫必在他们中间作王。这是耶和华说的。
{Eze 34:25} "I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild beasts from the land, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.
{Eze 34:25} “我必与他们立平安的约，使恶兽从境内断绝，他们就必安居在旷野，躺卧在林中。
{Eze 34:26} And I will make them and the places all around my hill a blessing, and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing.
{Eze 34:26} 我必使他们与我山的四围成为福源，我也必叫时雨落下，必有福如甘霖而降。
{Eze 34:27} And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land. And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke, and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
{Eze 34:27} 田野的树必结果，地也必有出产；他们必在故土安然居住。我折断他们所负的轭，救他们脱离那以他们为奴之人的手；那时，他们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 34:28} They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them. They shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.
{Eze 34:28} 他们必不再作外邦人的掠物，地上的野兽也不再吞吃他们；却要安然居住，无人惊吓。
{Eze 34:29} And I will provide for them renowned plantations so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the reproach of the nations.
{Eze 34:29} 我必给他们兴起有名的植物；他们在境内不再为饥荒所灭，也不再受外邦人的羞辱，
{Eze 34:30} And they shall know that I am the LORD their God with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 34:30} 必知道我、耶和华他们的神是与他们同在的，并知道他们以色列家是我的民。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 34:31} And you are my sheep, human sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 34:31} 你们作我的羊，我草场上的羊，乃是以色列人，我也是你们的神。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 35:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 35:1}  耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 35:2}  "Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
{Eze 35:2}  “人子啊，你要面向西珥山发预言，攻击他，
{Eze 35:3}  and say to it, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a desolation and a waste.
{Eze 35:3}  对他说，主耶和华如此说：西珥山哪，我与你为敌，必向你伸手攻击你，使你荒凉，令人惊骇。
{Eze 35:4}  I will lay your cities waste, and you shall become a desolation, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 35:4}  我必使你的城邑变为荒场，成为凄凉。你就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 35:5}  Because you cherished perpetual enmity and gave over the people of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of their final punishment,
{Eze 35:5}  因为你永怀仇恨，在以色列人遭灾、罪孽到了尽头的时候，将他们交与刀剑，
{Eze 35:6}  therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; because you did not hate bloodshed, therefore blood shall pursue you.
{Eze 35:6}  所以主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，我必使你遭遇流血的报应，罪（原文作血；本节同）必追赶你；你既不恨恶杀人流血，所以这罪必追赶你。
{Eze 35:7}  I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation, and I will cut off from it all who come and go.
{Eze 35:7}  我必使西珥山荒凉，令人惊骇，来往经过的人我必剪除。
{Eze 35:8}  And I will fill its mountains with the slain. On your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain with the sword shall fall.
{Eze 35:8}  我必使西珥山满有被杀的人。被刀杀的，必倒在你小山和山谷，并一切的溪水中。
{Eze 35:9}  I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 35:9}  我必使你永远荒凉，使你的城邑无人居住，你的民就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 35:10} "Because you said, 'These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will take possession of them'--although the LORD was there--
{Eze 35:10} “因为你曾说：‘这二国这二邦必归于我，我必得为业’（其实耶和华仍在那里），
{Eze 35:11} therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will deal with you according to the anger and envy that you showed because of your hatred against them. And I will make myself known among them, when I judge you.
{Eze 35:11} 所以主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，我必照你的怒气和你从仇恨中向他们所发的嫉妒待你。我审判你的时候，必将自己显明在他们中间。
{Eze 35:12} And you shall know that I am the LORD. "I have heard all the revilings that you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying, 'They are laid desolate; they are given us to devour.'
{Eze 35:12} 你也必知道我耶和华听见了你的一切毁谤，就是你攻击以色列山的话，说：‘这些山荒凉，是归我们吞灭的。’
{Eze 35:13} And you magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and multiplied your words against me; I heard it.
{Eze 35:13} 你们也用口向我夸大，增添与我反对的话，我都听见了。
{Eze 35:14} Thus says the Lord GOD: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
{Eze 35:14} 主耶和华如此说：全地欢乐的时候，我必使你荒凉。
{Eze 35:15} As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 35:15} 你怎样因以色列家的地业荒凉而喜乐，我必照你所行的待你。西珥山哪，你和以东全地必都荒凉。你们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 36:1}  "And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.
{Eze 36:1}  “人子啊，你要对以色列山发预言说：以色列山哪，要听耶和华的话。
{Eze 36:2}  Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the enemy said of you, 'Aha!' and, 'The ancient heights have become our possession,'
{Eze 36:2}  主耶和华如此说：因仇敌说：‘阿哈！这永久的山冈都归我们为业了！’
{Eze 36:3}  therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Precisely because they made you desolate and crushed you from all sides, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you became the talk and evil gossip of the people,
{Eze 36:3}  所以要发预言说，主耶和华如此说：因为敌人使你荒凉，四围吞吃，好叫你归与其余的外邦人为业，并且多嘴多舌的人提起你来，百姓也说你有臭名。
{Eze 36:4}  therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, the ravines and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations all around,
{Eze 36:4}  故此，以色列山要听主耶和华的话。大山小冈、水沟山谷、荒废之地、被弃之城，为四围其余的外邦人所占据、所讥刺的，
{Eze 36:5}  therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Surely I have spoken in my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave my land to themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, that they might make its pasturelands a prey.
{Eze 36:5}  主耶和华对你们如此说：我真发愤恨如火，责备那其余的外邦人和以东的众人。他们快乐满怀，心存恨恶，将我的地归自己为业，又看为被弃的掠物。
{Eze 36:6}  Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I have spoken in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered the reproach of the nations.
{Eze 36:6}  所以，你要指着以色列地说预言，对大山小冈、水沟山谷说，主耶和华如此说：我发愤恨和忿怒说，因你们曾受外邦人的羞辱，
{Eze 36:7}  Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I swear that the nations that are all around you shall themselves suffer reproach.
{Eze 36:7}  所以我起誓说：你们四围的外邦人总要担当自己的羞辱。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 36:8}  "But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people Israel, for they will soon come home.
{Eze 36:8}  “以色列山哪，你必发枝条，为我的民以色列结果子，因为他们快要来到。
{Eze 36:9}  For behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown.
{Eze 36:9}  看哪，我是帮助你的，也必向你转意，使你得以耕种。
{Eze 36:10} And I will multiply people on you, the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt.
{Eze 36:10} 我必使以色列全家的人数在你上面增多，城邑有人居住，荒场再被建造。
{Eze 36:11} And I will multiply on you man and beast, and they shall multiply and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
{Eze 36:11} 我必使人和牲畜在你上面加增；他们必生养众多。我要使你照旧有人居住，并要赐福与你比先前更多，你就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 36:12} I will let people walk on you, even my people Israel. And they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no longer bereave them of children.
{Eze 36:12} 我必使人，就是我的民以色列，行在你上面。他们必得你为业；你也不再使他们丧子。
{Eze 36:13} Thus says the Lord GOD: Because they say to you, 'You devour people, and you bereave your nation of children,'
{Eze 36:13} 主耶和华如此说：因为人对你说：‘你是吞吃人的，又使国民丧子’，
{Eze 36:14} therefore you shall no longer devour people and no longer bereave your nation of children, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 36:14} 所以主耶和华说：你必不再吞吃人，也不再使国民丧子。
{Eze 36:15} And I will not let you hear anymore the reproach of the nations, and you shall no longer bear the disgrace of the peoples and no longer cause your nation to stumble, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 36:15} 我使你不再听见各国的羞辱，不再受万民的辱骂，也不再使国民绊跌。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 36:16} The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 36:16} 耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 36:17} "Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds. Their ways before me were like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity.
{Eze 36:17} “人子啊，以色列家住在本地的时候，在行动作为上玷污那地。他们的行为在我面前，好像正在经期的妇人那样污秽。
{Eze 36:18} So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it.
{Eze 36:18} 所以我因他们在那地上流人的血，又因他们以偶像玷污那地，就把我的忿怒倾在他们身上。
{Eze 36:19} I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them.
{Eze 36:19} 我将他们分散在列国，四散在列邦，按他们的行动作为惩罚他们。
{Eze 36:20} But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, 'These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land.'
{Eze 36:20} 他们到了所去的列国，就使我的圣名被亵渎；因为人谈论他们说，这是耶和华的民，是从耶和华的地出来的。
{Eze 36:21} But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.
{Eze 36:21} 我却顾惜我的圣名，就是以色列家在所到的列国中所亵渎的。
{Eze 36:22} "Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.
{Eze 36:22} “所以，你要对以色列家说，主耶和华如此说：以色列家啊，我行这事不是为你们，乃是为我的圣名，就是在你们到的列国中所亵渎的。
{Eze 36:23} And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.
{Eze 36:23} 我要使我的大名显为圣；这名在列国中已被亵渎，就是你们在他们中间所亵渎的。我在他们眼前，在你们身上显为圣的时候，他们就知道我是耶和华。这是主耶和华说的。
{Eze 36:24} I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land.
{Eze 36:24} 我必从各国收取你们，从列邦聚集你们，引导你们归回本地。
{Eze 36:25} I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.
{Eze 36:25} 我必用清水洒在你们身上，你们就洁净了。我要洁净你们，使你们脱离一切的污秽，弃掉一切的偶像。

{Eze 36:26} 我也要赐给你们一个新心，将新灵放在你们里面，又从你们的肉体中除掉石心，赐给你们肉心。
{Eze 36:27} And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.

{Eze 36:31} Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations.
{Eze 36:31} 那时，你们必追想你们的恶行和你们不善的作为，就因你们的罪孽和可憎的事厌恶自己。
{Eze 36:32} It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
{Eze 36:32} 主耶和华说：你们要知道，我这样行不是为你们。以色列家啊，当为自己的行为抱愧蒙羞。
{Eze 36:33} "Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt.
{Eze 36:33} “主耶和华如此说：我洁净你们，使你们脱离一切罪孽的日子，必使城邑有人居住，荒场再被建造。
{Eze 36:34} And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by.
{Eze 36:34} 过路的人虽看为荒废之地，现今这荒废之地仍得耕种。
{Eze 36:35} And they will say, 'This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.'
{Eze 36:35} 他们必说：‘这先前为荒废之地，现在成如伊甸园；这荒废凄凉、毁坏的城邑现在坚固有人居住。’
{Eze 36:36} Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I am the LORD; I have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it.
{Eze 36:36} 那时，在你们四围其余的外邦人必知道我耶和华修造那毁坏之处，培植那荒废之地。我耶和华说过，也必成就。
{Eze 36:37} "Thus says the Lord GOD: This also I will let the house of Israel ask me to do for them: to increase their people like a flock.
{Eze 36:37} “主耶和华如此说：我要加增以色列家的人数，多如羊群。他们必为这事向我求问，我要给他们成就。
{Eze 36:38} Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
{Eze 36:38} 耶路撒冷在守节作祭物所献的羊群怎样多，照样，荒凉的城邑必被人群充满。他们就知道我是耶和华。”
{Eze 37:1}  The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones.
{Eze 37:1}  耶和华的灵（原文作手）降在我身上。耶和华藉他的灵带我出去，将我放在平原中；这平原遍满骸骨。
{Eze 37:2}  And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry.
{Eze 37:2}  他使我从骸骨的四围经过，谁知在平原的骸骨甚多，而且极其枯干。
{Eze 37:3}  And he said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered, "O Lord GOD, you know."
{Eze 37:3}  他对我说：“人子啊，这些骸骨能复活吗？”我说：“主耶和华啊，你是知道的。”
{Eze 37:4}  Then he said to me, "Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.
{Eze 37:4}  他又对我说：“你向这些骸骨发预言说：枯干的骸骨啊，要听耶和华的话。
{Eze 37:5}  Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live.
{Eze 37:5}  主耶和华对这些骸骨如此说：‘我必使气息进入你们里面，你们就要活了。
{Eze 37:6}  And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
{Eze 37:6}  我必给你们加上筋，使你们长肉，又将皮遮蔽你们，使气息进入你们里面，你们就要活了；你们便知道我是耶和华。’”
{Eze 37:7}  So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and behold, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
{Eze 37:7}  于是，我遵命说预言。正说预言的时候，不料，有响声，有地震；骨与骨互相联络。
{Eze 37:8}  And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them. But there was no breath in them.
{Eze 37:8}  我观看，见骸骨上有筋，也长了肉，又有皮遮蔽其上，只是还没有气息。
{Eze 37:9}  Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live."
{Eze 37:9}  主对我说：“人子啊，你要发预言，向风发预言，说主耶和华如此说：气息啊，要从四方（原文作风）而来，吹在这些被杀的人身上，使他们活了。”
{Eze 37:10} So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.
{Eze 37:10} 于是我遵命说预言，气息就进入骸骨，骸骨便活了，并且站起来，成为极大的军队。
{Eze 37:11} Then he said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are indeed cut off.'
{Eze 37:11} 主对我说：“人子啊，这些骸骨就是以色列全家。他们说：‘我们的骨头枯干了，我们的指望失去了，我们灭绝净尽了。’
{Eze 37:12} Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of Israel.
{Eze 37:12} 所以你要发预言对他们说，主耶和华如此说：‘我的民哪，我必开你们的坟墓，使你们从坟墓中出来，领你们进入以色列地。
{Eze 37:13} And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people.
{Eze 37:13} 我的民哪，我开你们的坟墓，使你们从坟墓中出来，你们就知道我是耶和华。
{Eze 37:14} And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD."
{Eze 37:14} 我必将我的灵放在你们里面，你们就要活了。我将你们安置在本地，你们就知道我耶和华如此说，也如此成就了。这是耶和华说的。’”
{Eze 37:15} The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 37:15} 耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Eze 37:16} "Son of man, take a stick and write on it, 'For Judah, and the people of Israel associated with him'; then take another stick and write on it, 'For Joseph (the stick of Ephraim) and all the house of Israel associated with him.'
{Eze 37:16} “人子啊，你要取一根木杖，在其上写‘为犹大和他的同伴以色列人’；又取一根木杖，在其上写‘为约瑟，就是为以法莲，又为他的同伴以色列全家’。
{Eze 37:17} And join them one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.
{Eze 37:17} 你要使这两根木杖接连为一，在你手中成为一根。
{Eze 37:18} And when your people say to you, 'Will you not tell us what you mean by these?'
{Eze 37:18} 你本国的子民问你说：‘这是什么意思？你不指示我们吗？’
{Eze 37:19} say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am about to take the stick of Joseph (that is in the hand of Ephraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with him. And I will join with it the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, that they may be one in my hand.
{Eze 37:19} 你就对他们说：‘主耶和华如此说：我要将约瑟和他同伴以色列支派的杖，就是那在以法莲手中的，与犹大的杖一同接连为一，在我手中成为一根。’
{Eze 37:20} When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes,
{Eze 37:20} 你所写的那两根杖要在他们眼前拿在手中，
{Eze 37:21} then say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all around, and bring them to their own land.
{Eze 37:21} 要对他们说，主耶和华如此说：我要将以色列人从他们所到的各国收取，又从四围聚集他们，引导他们归回本地。
{Eze 37:22} And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. And one king shall be king over them all, and they shall be no longer two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms.
{Eze 37:22} 我要使他们在那地，在以色列山上成为一国，有一王作他们众民的王。他们不再为二国，决不再分为二国；
{Eze 37:23} They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions. But I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
{Eze 37:23} 也不再因偶像和可憎的物，并一切的罪过玷污自己。我却要救他们出离一切的住处，就是他们犯罪的地方；我要洁净他们，如此，他们要作我的子民，我要作他们的神。
{Eze 37:24} "My servant David shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd. They shall walk in my rules and be careful to obey my statutes.
{Eze 37:24} “我的仆人大卫必作他们的王；众民必归一个牧人。他们必顺从我的典章，谨守遵行我的律例。
{Eze 37:25} They shall dwell in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They and their children and their children's children shall dwell there forever, and David my servant shall be their prince forever.
{Eze 37:25} 他们必住在我赐给我仆人雅各的地上，就是你们列祖所住之地。他们和他们的子孙，并子孙的子孙，都永远住在那里。我的仆人大卫必作他们的王，直到永远。
{Eze 37:26} I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them in their land and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore.
{Eze 37:26} 并且我要与他们立平安的约，作为永约。我也要将他们安置在本地，使他们的人数增多，又在他们中间设立我的圣所，直到永远。
{Eze 37:27} My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
{Eze 37:27} 我的居所必在他们中间；我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民。
{Eze 37:28} Then the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore."
{Eze 37:28} 我的圣所在以色列人中间直到永远，外邦人就必知道我是叫以色列成为圣的耶和华。”
{Eze 38:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Eze 38:1}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Eze 38:2}  "Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him
{Eze 38:2}  “人子啊，你要面向玛各地的歌革，就是罗施、米设、土巴的王发预言攻击他，
{Eze 38:3}  and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
{Eze 38:3}  说主耶和华如此说：罗施、米设、土巴的王歌革啊，我与你为敌。

{Eze 38:4}  我必用钩子钩住你的腮颊，调转你，将你和你的军兵、马匹、马兵带出来，都披挂整齐，成了大队，有大小盾牌，各拿刀剑。
{Eze 38:5}  Persia, Cush, and Put are with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
{Eze 38:5}  波斯人、古实人，和弗人（又作吕彼亚人），各拿盾牌，头上戴盔；

{Eze 38:7}  “那聚集到你这里的各队都当准备；你自己也要准备，作他们的大帅。
{Eze 38:8}  After many days you will be mustered. In the latter years you will go against the land that is restored from war, the land whose people were gathered from many peoples upon the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste. Its people were brought out from the peoples and now dwell securely, all of them.
{Eze 38:8}  过了多日，你必被差派。到末后之年，你必来到脱离刀剑从列国收回之地，到以色列常久荒凉的山上；但那从列国中招聚出来的必在其上安然居住。
{Eze 38:9}  You will advance, coming on like a storm. You will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your hordes, and many peoples with you.
{Eze 38:9}  你和你的军队，并同着你许多国的民，必如暴风上来，如密云遮盖地面。”

{Eze 38:10} 主耶和华如此说：“到那时，你心必起意念，图谋恶计，
{Eze 38:11} and say, 'I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will fall upon the quiet people who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having no bars or gates,'
{Eze 38:11} 说：‘我要上那无城墙的乡村，我要到那安静的民那里，他们都没有城墙，无门、无闩，安然居住。

{Eze 38:12} 我去要抢财为掳物，夺货为掠物，反手攻击那从前荒凉、现在有人居住之地，又攻击那住世界中间、从列国招聚、得了牲畜财货的民。’
{Eze 38:13} Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its leaders will say to you, 'Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your hosts to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to seize great spoil?'
{Eze 38:13} 示巴人、底但人、他施的客商，和其间的少壮狮子都必问你说：‘你来要抢财为掳物吗？你聚集军队要夺货为掠物吗？要夺取金银，掳去牲畜、财货吗？要抢夺许多财宝为掳物吗？’
{Eze 38:14} "Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day when my people Israel are dwelling securely, will you not know it?

{Eze 39:24} 我是照他们的污秽和罪过待他们，并且我掩面不顾他们。”
{Eze 39:25} "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and I will be jealous for my holy name.
{Eze 39:25} 主耶和华如此说：“我要使雅各被掳的人归回，要怜悯以色列全家，又为我的圣名发热心。
{Eze 39:26} They shall forget their shame and all the treachery they have practiced against me, when they dwell securely in their land with none to make them afraid,
{Eze 39:26} 他们在本地安然居住，无人惊吓，是我将他们从万民中领回，从仇敌之地召来。我在许多国的民眼前，在他们身上显为圣的时候，他们要担当自己的羞辱和干犯我的一切罪。
{Eze 39:27} when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from their enemies' lands, and through them have vindicated my holiness in the sight of many nations.
{Eze 39:27} (SEE 39:26)
{Eze 39:28} Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God, because I sent them into exile among the nations and then assembled them into their own land. I will leave none of them remaining among the nations anymore.
{Eze 39:28} 因我使他们被掳到外邦人中，后又聚集他们归回本地，他们就知道我是耶和华他们的神；我必不再留他们一人在外邦。
{Eze 39:29} And I will not hide my face anymore from them, when I pour out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 39:29} 我也不再掩面不顾他们，因我已将我的灵浇灌以色列家。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 40:1}  In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day, the hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me to the city.
{Eze 40:1}  我们被掳掠第二十五年，耶路撒冷城攻破后十四年，正在年初，月之初十日，耶和华的灵（原文作手）降在我身上，他把我带到以色列地。
{Eze 40:2}  In visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south.
{Eze 40:2}  在神的异象中带我到以色列地，安置在至高的山上；在山上的南边有彷佛一座城建立。
{Eze 40:3}  When he brought me there, behold, there was a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring reed in his hand. And he was standing in the gateway.
{Eze 40:3}  他带我到那里，见有一人，颜色（原文作形状）如铜，手拿麻绳和量度的竿，站在门口。
{Eze 40:4}  And the man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel."
{Eze 40:4}  那人对我说：“人子啊，凡我所指示你的，你都要用眼看，用耳听，并要放在心上。我带你到这里来，特为要指示你；凡你所见的，你都要告诉以色列家。”
{Eze 40:5}  And behold, there was a wall all around the outside of the temple area, and the length of the measuring reed in the man's hand was six long cubits, each being a cubit and a handbreadth in length. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.
{Eze 40:5}  我见殿四围有墙。那人手拿量度的竿，长六肘，每肘是一肘零一掌。他用竿量墙，厚一竿，高一竿。
{Eze 40:6}  Then he went into the gateway facing east, going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep.
{Eze 40:6}  他到了朝东的门，就上门的台阶，量门的这槛，宽一竿；又量门的那槛，宽一竿。
{Eze 40:7}  And the side rooms, one reed long and one reed broad; and the space between the side rooms, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end, one reed.
{Eze 40:7}  又有卫房，每房长一竿，宽一竿，相隔五肘。门槛，就是挨着向殿的廊门槛，宽一竿。
{Eze 40:8}  Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, on the inside, one reed.
{Eze 40:8}  他又量向殿门的廊子，宽一竿。
{Eze 40:9}  Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and its jambs, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end.
{Eze 40:9}  又量门廊，宽八肘，墙柱厚二肘；那门的廊子向着殿。
{Eze 40:10} And there were three side rooms on either side of the east gate. The three were of the same size, and the jambs on either side were of the same size.
{Eze 40:10} 东门洞有卫房：这旁三间，那旁三间，都是一样的尺寸；这边的柱子和那边的柱子，也是一样的尺寸。
{Eze 40:11} Then he measured the width of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the length of the gateway, thirteen cubits.
{Eze 40:11} 他量门口，宽十肘，长十三肘。
{Eze 40:12} There was a barrier before the side rooms, one cubit on either side. And the side rooms were six cubits on either side.
{Eze 40:12} 卫房前展出的境界：这边一肘，那边一肘；卫房这边六肘，那边六肘。
{Eze 40:13} Then he measured the gate from the ceiling of the one side room to the ceiling of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits; the openings faced each other.
{Eze 40:13} 又量门洞，从这卫房顶的后檐到那卫房顶的后檐，宽二十五肘；卫房门与门相对。
{Eze 40:14} He measured also the vestibule, sixty cubits. And around the vestibule of the gateway was the court.
{Eze 40:14} 又量（原文作造）廊子六十肘（七十士译本是二十肘），墙柱外是院子，有廊为界，在门洞两边。
{Eze 40:15} From the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.
{Eze 40:15} 从大门口到内廊前，共五十肘。
{Eze 40:16} And the gateway had windows all around, narrowing inwards toward the side rooms and toward their jambs, and likewise the vestibule had windows all around inside, and on the jambs were palm trees.
{Eze 40:16} 卫房和门洞两旁柱间并廊子，都有严紧的窗棂；里边都有窗棂，柱上有雕刻的棕树。
{Eze 40:17} Then he brought me into the outer court. And behold, there were chambers and a pavement, all around the court. Thirty chambers faced the pavement.
{Eze 40:17} 他带我到外院，见院的四围有铺石地；铺石地上有屋子三十间。
{Eze 40:18} And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates. This was the lower pavement.
{Eze 40:18} 铺石地，就是矮铺石地在各门洞两旁，以门洞的长短为度。
{Eze 40:19} Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, a hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side.
{Eze 40:19} 他从下门量到内院外，共宽一百肘，东面北面都是如此。
{Eze 40:20} As for the gate that faced toward the north, belonging to the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth.
{Eze 40:20} 他量外院朝北的门，长宽若干。
{Eze 40:21} Its side rooms, three on either side, and its jambs and its vestibule were of the same size as those of the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
{Eze 40:21} 门洞的卫房，这旁三间，那旁三间。门洞的柱子和廊子，与第一门的尺寸一样。门洞长五十肘，宽二十五肘。

{Eze 40:22} 其窗棂和廊子，并雕刻的棕树，与朝东的门尺寸一样。登七层台阶上到这门，前面有廊子。
{Eze 40:23} And opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.
{Eze 40:23} 内院有门与这门相对，北面东面都是如此。他从这门量到那门，共一百肘。
{Eze 40:24} And he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate on the south. And he measured its jambs and its vestibule; they had the same size as the others.
{Eze 40:24} 他带我往南去，见朝南有门，又照先前的尺寸量门洞的柱子和廊子。
{Eze 40:25} Both it and its vestibule had windows all around, like the windows of the others. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
{Eze 40:25} 门洞两旁与廊子的周围都有窗棂，和先量的窗棂一样。门洞长五十肘，宽二十五肘。

{Eze 40:26} 登七层台阶上到这门，前面有廊子；柱上有雕刻的棕树，这边一棵，那边一棵。
{Eze 40:27} And there was a gate on the south of the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.
{Eze 40:27} 内院朝南有门。从这门量到朝南的那门，共一百肘。

{Eze 40:37} 廊柱朝着外院。门洞两旁的柱子都有雕刻的棕树。登八层台阶上到这门。
{Eze 40:38} There was a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, where the burnt offering was to be washed.
{Eze 40:38} 门洞的柱旁有屋子和门；祭司（原文作他们）在那里洗燔祭牲。
{Eze 40:39} And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered.
{Eze 40:39} 在门廊内，这边有两张桌子，那边有两张桌子，在其上可以宰杀燔祭牲、赎罪祭牲，和赎愆祭牲。
{Eze 40:40} And off to the side, on the outside as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and off to the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables.
{Eze 40:40} 上到朝北的门口，这边有两张桌子，门廊那边也有两张桌子。
{Eze 40:41} Four tables were on either side of the gate, eight tables, on which to slaughter.
{Eze 40:41} 门这边有四张桌子，那边有四张桌子，共八张；在其上祭司宰杀牺牲。
{Eze 40:42} And there were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered.
{Eze 40:42} 为燔祭牲有四张桌子，是凿过的石头做成的，长一肘半，宽一肘半，高一肘。祭司将宰杀燔祭牲和平安祭牲所用的器皿放在其上。
{Eze 40:43} And hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened all around within. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.
{Eze 40:43} 有钩子，宽一掌，钉在廊内的四围。桌子上有牺牲的肉。
{Eze 40:44} On the outside of the inner gateway there were two chambers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the south gate facing north.
{Eze 40:44} 在北门旁，内院里有屋子，为歌唱的人而设。这屋子朝南（南：原文作东）；在南门旁，又有一间朝北。
{Eze 40:45} And he said to me, "This chamber that faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple,
{Eze 40:45} 他对我说：“这朝南的屋子是为看守殿宇的祭司；
{Eze 40:46} and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who alone among the sons of Levi may come near to the LORD to minister to him."
{Eze 40:46} 那朝北的屋子是为看守祭坛的祭司。这些祭司是利未人中撒督的子孙，近前来事奉耶和华的。”
{Eze 40:47} And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad, a square. And the altar was in front of the temple.
{Eze 40:47} 他又量内院，长一百肘，宽一百肘，是见方的。祭坛在殿前。
{Eze 40:48} Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on either side. And the breadth of the gate was fourteen cubits, and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side.
{Eze 40:48} 于是他带我到殿前的廊子，量廊子的墙柱。这面厚五肘，那面厚五肘。门两旁，这边三肘，那边三肘。
{Eze 40:49} The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve cubits, and people would go up to it by ten steps. And there were pillars beside the jambs, one on either side.
{Eze 40:49} 廊子长二十肘，宽十一肘。上廊子有台阶。靠近墙柱又有柱子，这边一根，那边一根。
{Eze 41:1}  Then he brought me to the nave and measured the jambs. On each side six cubits was the breadth of the jambs.
{Eze 41:1}  他带我到殿那里量墙柱：这面厚六肘，那面厚六肘，宽窄与会幕相同。
{Eze 41:2}  And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side. And he measured the length of the nave, forty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits.
{Eze 41:2}  门口宽十肘。门两旁，这边五肘，那边五肘。他量殿长四十肘，宽二十肘。
{Eze 41:3}  Then he went into the inner room and measured the jambs of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls on either side of the entrance, seven cubits.
{Eze 41:3}  他到内殿量墙柱，各厚二肘。门口宽六肘，门两旁各宽七肘。
{Eze 41:4}  And he measured the length of the room, twenty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits, across the nave. And he said to me, "This is the Most Holy Place."
{Eze 41:4}  他量内殿，长二十肘，宽二十肘。他对我说：“这是至圣所。”
{Eze 41:5}  Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick, and the breadth of the side chambers, four cubits, all around the temple.
{Eze 41:5}  他又量殿墙，厚六肘；围着殿有旁屋，各宽四肘。
{Eze 41:6}  And the side chambers were in three stories, one over another, thirty in each story. There were offsets all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple.
{Eze 41:6}  旁屋有三层，层叠而上，每层排列三十间。旁屋的梁木搁在殿墙坎上，免得插入殿墙。
{Eze 41:7}  And it became broader as it wound upward to the side chambers, because the temple was enclosed upward all around the temple. Thus the temple had a broad area upward, and so one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story.
{Eze 41:7}  这围殿的旁屋越高越宽；因旁屋围殿悬叠而上，所以越上越宽，从下一层，由中一层，到上一层。
{Eze 41:8}  I saw also that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six long cubits.
{Eze 41:8}  我又见围着殿有高月台。旁屋的根基，高足一竿，就是六大肘。
{Eze 41:9}  The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. The free space between the side chambers of the temple and the
{Eze 41:9}  旁屋的外墙厚五肘。旁屋之外还有余地。
{Eze 41:10} other chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side.
{Eze 41:10} 在旁屋与对面的房屋中间有空地，宽二十肘。
{Eze 41:11} And the doors of the side chambers opened on the free space, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the free space was five cubits all around.
{Eze 41:11} 旁屋的门都向余地：一门向北，一门向南。周围的余地宽五肘。
{Eze 41:12} The building that was facing the separate yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.
{Eze 41:12} 在西面空地之后有房子，宽七十肘，长九十肘，墙四围厚五肘。
{Eze 41:13} Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls, a hundred cubits long;
{Eze 41:13} 这样，他量殿，长一百肘，又量空地和那房子并墙，共长一百肘。
{Eze 41:14} also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard, a hundred cubits.
{Eze 41:14} 殿的前面和两旁的空地，宽一百肘。
{Eze 41:15} Then he measured the length of the building facing the yard that was at the back and its galleries on either side, a hundred cubits. The inside of the nave and the vestibules of the court,
{Eze 41:15} 他量空地后面的那房子，并两旁的楼廊，共长一百肘。
{Eze 41:16} the thresholds and the narrow windows and the galleries all around the three of them, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, from the floor up to the windows (now the windows were covered),
{Eze 41:16} 内殿、院廊、门槛、严紧的窗棂，并对着门槛的三层楼廊，从地到窗棂（窗棂都有蔽子），
{Eze 41:17} to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. And on all the walls all around, inside and outside, was a measured pattern.
{Eze 41:17} 直到门以上，就是到内殿和外殿内外四围墙壁，都按尺寸用木板遮蔽。
{Eze 41:18} It was carved of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Every cherub had two faces:
{Eze 41:18} 墙上雕刻基路伯和棕树。每二基路伯中间有一棵棕树，每基路伯有二脸。
{Eze 41:19} a human face toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple all around.
{Eze 41:19} 这边有人脸向着棕树，那边有狮子脸向着棕树，殿内周围都是如此。
{Eze 41:20} From the floor to above the door, cherubim and palm trees were carved; similarly the wall of the nave.
{Eze 41:20} 从地至门以上，都有基路伯和棕树。殿墙就是这样。
{Eze 41:21} The doorposts of the nave were squared, and in front of the Holy Place was something resembling
{Eze 41:21} 殿的门柱是方的。至圣所的前面，形状和殿的形状一样。
{Eze 41:22} an altar of wood, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits broad. Its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD."
{Eze 41:22} 坛是木头做的，高三肘，长二肘。坛角和坛面，并四旁，都是木头做的。他对我说：“这是耶和华面前的桌子。”
{Eze 41:23} The nave and the Holy Place had each a double door.
{Eze 41:23} 殿和至圣所的门各有两扇。
{Eze 41:24} The double doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves for each door.
{Eze 41:24} 每扇分两扇，这两扇是摺叠的。这边门分两扇，那边门也分两扇。
{Eze 41:25} And on the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, such as were carved on the walls. And there was a canopy of wood in front of the vestibule outside.
{Eze 41:25} 殿的门扇上雕刻基路伯和棕树，与刻在墙上的一般。在外头廊前有木槛。
{Eze 41:26} And there were narrow windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls of the vestibule, the side chambers of the temple, and the canopies.
{Eze 41:26} 廊这边那边都有严紧的窗棂和棕树；殿的旁屋和槛就是这样。
{Eze 42:1}  Then he led me out into the outer court, toward the north, and he brought me to the chambers that were opposite the separate yard and opposite the building on the north.
{Eze 42:1}  他带我出来向北，到外院，又带我进入圣屋；这圣屋一排顺着空地，一排与北边铺石地之屋相对。
{Eze 42:2}  The length of the building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits.
{Eze 42:2}  这圣屋长一百肘，宽五十肘，有向北的门。
{Eze 42:3}  Facing the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing the pavement that belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.
{Eze 42:3}  对着内院那二十肘宽之空地，又对着外院的铺石地，在第三层楼上有楼廊对着楼廊。
{Eze 42:4}  And before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long, and their doors were on the north.
{Eze 42:4}  在圣屋前有一条夹道，宽十肘，长一百肘。房门都向北。
{Eze 42:5}  Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building.
{Eze 42:5}  圣屋因为楼廊占去些地方，所以上层比中下两层窄些。
{Eze 42:6}  For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courts. Thus the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones.
{Eze 42:6}  圣屋有三层，却无柱子，不像外院的屋子有柱子；所以上层比中下两层更窄。
{Eze 42:7}  And there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, fifty cubits long.
{Eze 42:7}  圣屋外，东边有墙，靠着外院，长五十肘。
{Eze 42:8}  For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite the nave were a hundred cubits long.
{Eze 42:8}  靠着外院的圣屋长五十肘。殿北面的圣屋长一百肘。
{Eze 42:9}  Below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.
{Eze 42:9}  在圣屋以下，东头有进入之处，就是从外院进入之处。
{Eze 42:10} In the thickness of the wall of the court, on the south also, opposite the yard and opposite the building, there were chambers
{Eze 42:10} 向南（原文作东）在内院墙里有圣屋，一排与铺石地之屋相对，一排顺着空地。
{Eze 42:11} with a passage in front of them. They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits and arrangements and doors,
{Eze 42:11} 这圣屋前的夹道与北边圣屋的夹道长宽一样；出入之处与北屋门的样式相同。
{Eze 42:12} as were the entrances of the chambers on the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the passage, the passage before the corresponding wall on the east as one enters them.
{Eze 42:12} 正在墙前、夹道的东头，有门可以进入，与向南圣屋的门一样。
{Eze 42:13} Then he said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers opposite the yard are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall put the most holy offerings--the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering--for the place is holy.
{Eze 42:13} 他对我说：“顺着空地的南屋北屋，都是圣屋；亲近耶和华的祭司当在那里吃至圣的物，也当在那里放至圣的物，就是素祭、赎罪祭，和赎愆祭，因此处为圣。
{Eze 42:14} When the priests enter the Holy Place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people."
{Eze 42:14} 祭司进去出了圣所的时候，不可直到外院，但要在圣屋放下他们供职的衣服，因为是圣衣；要穿上别的衣服才可以到属民的外院。”
{Eze 42:15} Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faced east, and measured the temple area all around.
{Eze 42:15} 他量完了内殿，就带我出朝东的门，量院的四围。
{Eze 42:16} He measured the east side with the measuring reed, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.
{Eze 42:16} 他用量度的竿量四围，量东面五百肘（原文作竿；本章下同），
{Eze 42:17} He measured the north side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.
{Eze 42:17} 用竿量北面五百肘，
{Eze 42:18} He measured the south side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed.
{Eze 42:18} 用竿量南面五百肘，
{Eze 42:19} Then he turned to the west side and measured, 500 cubits by the measuring reed.
{Eze 42:19} 又转到西面，用竿量五百肘。
{Eze 42:20} He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, 500 cubits long and 500 cubits broad, to make a separation between the holy and the common.
{Eze 42:20} 他量四面，四围有墙，长五百肘，宽五百肘，为要分别圣地与俗地。
{Eze 43:1}  Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing east.
{Eze 43:1}  以后，他带我到一座门，就是朝东的门。
{Eze 43:2}  And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.
{Eze 43:2}  以色列神的荣光从东而来。他的声音如同多水的声音；地就因他的荣耀发光。
{Eze 43:3}  And the vision I saw was just like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and just like the vision that I had seen by the Chebar canal. And I fell on my face.
{Eze 43:3}  其状如从前他来灭城的时候我所见的异象，那异象如我在迦巴鲁河边所见的异象，我就俯伏在地。
{Eze 43:4}  As the glory of the LORD entered the temple by the gate facing east,
{Eze 43:4}  耶和华的荣光从朝东的门照入殿中。
{Eze 43:5}  the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
{Eze 43:5}  灵将我举起，带入内院，不料，耶和华的荣光充满了殿。
{Eze 43:6}  While the man was standing beside me, I heard one speaking to me out of the temple,
{Eze 43:6}  我听见有一位从殿中对我说话。有一人站在我旁边。
{Eze 43:7}  and he said to me, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoring and by the dead bodies of their kings at their high places,
{Eze 43:7}  他对我说：“人子啊，这是我宝座之地，是我脚掌所踏之地。我要在这里住，在以色列人中直到永远。以色列家和他们的君王必不再玷污我的圣名，就是行邪淫、在锡安的高处葬埋他们君王的尸首，
{Eze 43:8}  by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them. They have defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger.
{Eze 43:8}  使他们的门槛挨近我的门槛，他们的门框挨近我的门框；他们与我中间仅隔一墙，并且行可憎的事，玷污了我的圣名，所以我发怒灭绝他们。
{Eze 43:9}  Now let them put away their whoring and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.
{Eze 43:9}  现在他们当从我面前远除邪淫和他们君王的尸首，我就住在他们中间直到永远。
{Eze 43:10} "As for you, son of man, describe to the house of Israel the temple, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and they shall measure the plan.
{Eze 43:10} “人子啊，你要将这殿指示以色列家，使他们因自己的罪孽惭愧，也要他们量殿的尺寸。
{Eze 43:11} And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, that is, its whole design; and make known to them as well all its statutes and its whole design and all its laws, and write it down in their sight, so that they may observe all its laws and all its statutes and carry them out.
{Eze 43:11} 他们若因自己所行的一切事惭愧，你就将殿的规模、样式、出入之处，和一切形状、典章、礼仪、法则指示他们，在他们眼前写上，使他们遵照殿的一切规模典章去做。
{Eze 43:12} This is the law of the temple: the whole territory on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.
{Eze 43:12} 殿的法则乃是如此：殿在山顶上，四围的全界要称为至圣。这就是殿的法则。”
{Eze 43:13} "These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): its base shall be one cubit high and one cubit broad, with a rim of one span around its edge. And this shall be the height of the altar:
{Eze 43:13} 以下量祭坛，是以肘为度（这肘是一肘零一掌）。底座高一肘，边宽一肘，四围起边高一掌，这是坛的座。
{Eze 43:14} from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a breadth of one cubit;

{Eze 43:18} 他对我说：“人子啊，主耶和华如此说：建造祭坛，为要在其上献燔祭洒血，造成的时候典章如下：
{Eze 43:19} you shall give to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who draw near to me to minister to me, declares the Lord GOD, a bull from the herd for a sin offering.
{Eze 43:19} 主耶和华说，你要将一只公牛犊作为赎罪祭，给祭司利未人撒督的后裔，就是那亲近我、事奉我的。
{Eze 43:20} And you shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the ledge and upon the rim all around. Thus you shall purify the altar and make atonement for it.
{Eze 43:20} 你要取些公牛的血，抹在坛的四角和磴台的四拐角，并四围所起的边上。你这样洁净坛，坛就洁净了。
{Eze 43:21} You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place belonging to the temple, outside the sacred area.
{Eze 43:21} 你又要将那作赎罪祭的公牛犊烧在殿外、圣地之外预定之处。
{Eze 43:22} And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering; and the altar shall be purified, as it was purified with the bull.
{Eze 43:22} 次日，要将无残疾的公山羊献为赎罪祭；要洁净坛，像用公牛犊洁净的一样。
{Eze 43:23} When you have finished purifying it, you shall offer a bull from the herd without blemish and a ram from the flock without blemish.
{Eze 43:23} 洁净了坛，就要将一只无残疾的公牛犊和羊群中一只无残疾的公绵羊
{Eze 43:24} You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall sprinkle salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD.
{Eze 43:24} 奉到耶和华前。祭司要撒盐在其上，献与耶和华为燔祭。
{Eze 43:25} For seven days you shall provide daily a male goat for a sin offering; also, a bull from the herd and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be provided.
{Eze 43:25} 七日内，每日要预备一只公山羊为赎罪祭，也要预备一只公牛犊和羊群中的一只公绵羊，都要没有残疾的。
{Eze 43:26} Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, and so consecrate it.
{Eze 43:26} 七日祭司洁净坛，坛就洁净了；要这样把坛分别为圣。
{Eze 43:27} And when they have completed these days, then from the eighth day onward the priests shall offer on the altar your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, and I will accept you, declares the Lord GOD."
{Eze 43:27} 满了七日，自八日以后，祭司要在坛上献你们的燔祭和平安祭；我必悦纳你们。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 44:1}  Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east. And it was shut.
{Eze 44:1}  他又带我回到圣地朝东的外门；那门关闭了。
{Eze 44:2}  And the LORD said to me, "This gate shall remain shut; it shall not be opened, and no one shall enter by it, for the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered by it. Therefore it shall remain shut.
{Eze 44:2}  耶和华对我说：“这门必须关闭，不可敞开，谁也不可由其中进入；因为耶和华以色列的神已经由其中进入，所以必须关闭。
{Eze 44:3}  Only the prince may sit in it to eat bread before the LORD. He shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gate, and shall go out by the same way."
{Eze 44:3}  至于王，他必按王的位分，坐在其内，在耶和华面前吃饼。他必由这门的廊而入，也必由此而出。”
{Eze 44:4}  Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple, and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple of the LORD. And I fell on my face.
{Eze 44:4}  他又带我由北门来到殿前。我观看，见耶和华的荣光充满耶和华的殿，我就俯伏在地。
{Eze 44:5}  And the LORD said to me, "Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I shall tell you concerning all the statutes of the temple of the LORD and all its laws. And mark well the entrance to the temple and all the exits from the sanctuary.
{Eze 44:5}  耶和华对我说：“人子啊，我对你所说耶和华殿中的一切典章法则，你要放在心上，用眼看，用耳听，并要留心殿宇和圣地一切出入之处。
{Eze 44:6}  And say to the rebellious house, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: O house of Israel, enough of all your abominations,
{Eze 44:6}  你要对那悖逆的以色列家说，主耶和华如此说：以色列家啊，你们行一切可憎的事，当够了吧！
{Eze 44:7}  in admitting foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, to be in my sanctuary, profaning my temple, when you offer to me my food, the fat and the blood. You have broken my covenant, in addition to all your abominations.
{Eze 44:7}  你们把我的食物，就是脂油和血献上的时候，将身心未受割礼的外邦人领进我的圣地，玷污了我的殿；又背了我的约，在你们一切可憎的事上，加上这一层。
{Eze 44:8}  And you have not kept charge of my holy things, but you have set others to keep my charge for you in my sanctuary.
{Eze 44:8}  你们也没有看守我的圣物，却派别人在圣地替你们看守我所吩咐你们的。

{Eze 44:11} 然而他们必在我的圣地当仆役，照管殿门，在殿中供职；必为民宰杀燔祭牲和平安祭牲，必站在民前伺候他们。

{Eze 46:4}  安息日，王所献与耶和华的燔祭要用无残疾的羊羔六只，无残疾的公绵羊一只；
{Eze 46:5}  And the grain offering with the ram shall be an ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.
{Eze 46:5}  同献的素祭要为公绵羊献一伊法细面，为羊羔照他的力量而献，一伊法细面加油一欣。
{Eze 46:6}  On the day of the new moon he shall offer a bull from the herd without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish.
{Eze 46:6}  当月朔，要献无残疾的公牛犊一只，羊羔六只，公绵羊一只，都要无残疾的。
{Eze 46:7}  As a grain offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.
{Eze 46:7}  他也要预备素祭，为公牛献一伊法细面，为公绵羊献一伊法细面，为羊羔照他的力量而献，一伊法细面加油一欣。
{Eze 46:8}  When the prince enters, he shall enter by the vestibule of the gate, and he shall go out by the same way.
{Eze 46:8}  王进入的时候必由这门的廊而入，也必由此而出。
{Eze 46:9}  "When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate, and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate: no one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered, but each shall go out straight ahead.
{Eze 46:9}  “在各节期，国内居民朝见耶和华的时候，从北门进入敬拜的，必由南门而出；从南门进入的，必由北门而出。不可从所入的门而出，必要直往前行，由对门而出。
{Eze 46:10} When they enter, the prince shall enter with them, and when they go out, he shall go out.
{Eze 46:10} 民进入，王也要在民中进入；民出去，王也要一同出去。
{Eze 46:11} "At the feasts and the appointed festivals, the grain offering with a young bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah.
{Eze 46:11} “在节期和圣会的日子同献的素祭，要为一只公牛献一伊法细面，为一只公绵羊献一伊法细面，为羊羔照他的力量而献，一伊法细面加油一欣。
{Eze 46:12} When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall offer his burnt offering or his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out the gate shall be shut.
{Eze 46:12} 王预备甘心献的燔祭或平安祭，就是向耶和华甘心献的，当有人为他开朝东的门。他就预备燔祭和平安祭，与安息日预备的一样，献毕就出去。他出去之后，当有人将门关闭。”
{Eze 46:13} "You shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning you shall provide it.
{Eze 46:13} “每日，你要预备无残疾一岁的羊羔一只，献与耶和华为燔祭；要每早晨预备。
{Eze 46:14} And you shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, one sixth of an ephah, and one third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour, as a grain offering to the LORD. This is a perpetual statute.
{Eze 46:14} 每早晨也要预备同献的素祭，细面一伊法六分之一，并油一欣三分之一，调和细面。这素祭要常献与耶和华为永远的定例。
{Eze 46:15} Thus the lamb and the meal offering and the oil shall be provided, morning by morning, for a regular burnt offering.
{Eze 46:15} 每早晨要这样预备羊羔、素祭，并油为常献的燔祭。”
{Eze 46:16} "Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons as his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons. It is their property by inheritance.
{Eze 46:16} 主耶和华如此说：“王若将产业赐给他的儿子，就成了他儿子的产业，那是他们承受为业的。
{Eze 46:17} But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty. Then it shall revert to the prince; surely it is his inheritance--it shall belong to his sons.
{Eze 46:17} 倘若王将一分产业赐给他的臣仆，就成了他臣仆的产业；到自由之年仍要归与王。至于王的产业，必归与他的儿子。
{Eze 46:18} The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting them out of their property. He shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people shall be scattered from his property."
{Eze 46:18} 王不可夺取民的产业，以致驱逐他们离开所承受的；他要从自己的地业中，将产业赐给他儿子，免得我的民分散，各人离开所承受的。”
{Eze 46:19} Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests, and behold, a place was there at the extreme western end of them.
{Eze 46:19} 那带我的，将我从门旁进入之处、领进为祭司预备的圣屋，是朝北的，见后头西边有一块地。
{Eze 46:20} And he said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so transmit holiness to the people."
{Eze 46:20} 他对我说：“这是祭司煮赎愆祭、赎罪祭，烤素祭之地，免得带到外院，使民成圣。”
{Eze 46:21} Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me around to the four corners of the court. And behold, in each corner of the court there was another court--
{Eze 46:21} 他又带我到外院，使我经过院子的四拐角，见每拐角各有一个院子。
{Eze 46:22} in the four corners of the court were small courts, forty cubits long and thirty broad; the four were of the same size.
{Eze 46:22} 院子四拐角的院子，周围有墙，每院长四十肘，宽三十肘。四拐角院子的尺寸都是一样，
{Eze 46:23} On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with hearths made at the bottom of the rows all around.
{Eze 46:23} 其中周围有一排房子，房子内有煮肉的地方。
{Eze 46:24} Then he said to me, "These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people."
{Eze 46:24} 他对我说：“这都是煮肉的房子，殿内的仆役要在这里煮民的祭物。”
{Eze 47:1}  Then he brought me back to the door of the temple, and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar.
{Eze 47:1}  他带我回到殿门，见殿的门槛下有水往东流出（原来殿面朝东）。这水从槛下，由殿的右边，在祭坛的南边往下流。
{Eze 47:2}  Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side.
{Eze 47:2}  他带我出北门，又领我从外边转到朝东的外门，见水从右边流出。
{Eze 47:3}  Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep.
{Eze 47:3}  他手拿准绳往东出去的时候，量了一千肘，使我趟过水，水到踝子骨。
{Eze 47:4}  Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep.
{Eze 47:4}  他又量了一千肘，使我趟过水，水就到膝；再量了一千肘，使我趟过水，水便到腰；
{Eze 47:5}  Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
{Eze 47:5}  又量了一千肘，水便成了河，使我不能趟过。因为水势涨起，成为可洑的水，不可趟的河。
{Eze 47:6}  And he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?" Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
{Eze 47:6}  他对我说：“人子啊，你看见了什么？”他就带我回到河边。
{Eze 47:7}  As I went back, I saw on the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other.
{Eze 47:7}  我回到河边的时候，见在河这边与那边的岸上有极多的树木。
{Eze 47:8}  And he said to me, "This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, and enters the sea; when the water flows into the sea, the water will become fresh.
{Eze 47:8}  他对我说：“这水往东方流去，必下到亚拉巴，直到海。所发出来的水必流入盐海，使水变甜（原文作得医治；下同）。
{Eze 47:9}  And wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish. For this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.
{Eze 47:9}  这河水所到之处，凡滋生的动物都必生活，并且因这流来的水必有极多的鱼，海水也变甜了。这河水所到之处，百物都必生活。
{Eze 47:10} Fishermen will stand beside the sea. From Engedi to Eneglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets. Its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea.
{Eze 47:10} 必有渔夫站在河边，从隐基底直到隐以革莲，都作晒（或作：张）网之处。那鱼各从其类，好像大海的鱼甚多。
{Eze 47:11} But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt.
{Eze 47:11} 只是泥泞之地与洼湿之处不得治好，必为盐地。
{Eze 47:12} And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing."
{Eze 47:12} 在河这边与那边的岸上必生长各类的树木；其果可作食物，叶子不枯干，果子不断绝。每月必结新果子，因为这水是从圣所流出来的。树上的果子必作食物，叶子乃为治病。”
{Eze 47:13} Thus says the Lord GOD: "This is the boundary by which you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.
{Eze 47:13} 主耶和华如此说：“你们要照地的境界，按以色列十二支派分地为业。约瑟必得两分。
{Eze 47:14} And you shall divide equally what I swore to give to your fathers. This land shall fall to you as your inheritance.
{Eze 47:14} 你们承受这地为业，要彼此均分；因为我曾起誓应许将这地赐与你们的列祖；这地必归你们为业。
{Eze 47:15} "This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, and on to Zedad,
{Eze 47:15} “地的四界乃是如此：北界从大海往希特伦，直到西达达口。
{Eze 47:16} Berothah, Sibraim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
{Eze 47:16} 又往哈马、比罗他、西伯莲（西伯莲在大马色与哈马两界中间），到浩兰边界的哈撒哈提干。
{Eze 47:17} So the boundary shall run from the sea to Hazar-enan, which is on the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This shall be the north side.
{Eze 47:17} 这样，境界从海边往大马色地界上的哈萨以难，北边以哈马地为界。这是北界。
{Eze 47:18} "On the east side, the boundary shall run between Hauran and Damascus; along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel; to the eastern sea and as far as Tamar. This shall be the east side.
{Eze 47:18} “东界在浩兰、大马色、基列，和以色列地的中间，就是约但河。你们要从北界量到东海。这是东界。
{Eze 47:19} "On the south side, it shall run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah-kadesh, from there along the Brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. This shall be the south side.
{Eze 47:19} “南界是从他玛到米利巴加低斯的水，延到埃及小河，直到大海。这是南界。
{Eze 47:20} "On the west side, the Great Sea shall be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This shall be the west side.
{Eze 47:20} “西界就是大海，从南界直到哈马口对面之地。这是西界。
{Eze 47:21} "So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel.
{Eze 47:21} “你们要按着以色列的支派彼此分这地。
{Eze 47:22} You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the sojourners who reside among you and have had children among you. They shall be to you as native-born children of Israel. With you they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
{Eze 47:22} 要拈阄分这地为业，归与自己和你们中间寄居的外人，就是在你们中间生养儿女的外人。你们要看他们如同以色列人中所生的一样；他们在以色列支派中要与你们同得地业
{Eze 47:23} In whatever tribe the sojourner resides, there you shall assign him his inheritance, declares the Lord GOD.
{Eze 47:23} 外人寄居在哪支派中，你们就在那里分给他地业。这是主耶和华说的。”
{Eze 48:1}  "These are the names of the tribes: Beginning at the northern extreme, beside the way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enan (which is on the northern border of Damascus over against Hamath), and extending from the east side to the west, Dan, one portion.
{Eze 48:1}  众支派按名所得之地记在下面：从北头，由希特伦往哈马口，到大马色地界上的哈萨以难。北边靠着哈马地（各支派的地都有东西的边界），是但的一分。

{Eze 48:11} 这地要归与撒督的子孙中成为圣的祭司，就是那守我所吩咐的。当以色列人走迷的时候，他们不像那些利未人走迷了。
{Eze 48:12} And it shall belong to them as a special portion from the holy portion of the land, a most holy place, adjoining the territory of the Levites.
{Eze 48:12} 这要归与他们为供地，是全地中至圣的。供地挨着利未人的地界。
{Eze 48:13} And alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites shall have an allotment 25,000 cubits in length and 10,000 in breadth. The whole length shall be 25,000 cubits and the breadth 20,000.
