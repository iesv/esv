{Lev 5:11}  “他的力量若不够献两只斑鸠或是两只雏鸽，就要因所犯的罪带供物来，就是细面伊法十分之一为赎罪祭；不可加上油，也不可加上乳香，因为是赎罪祭。
{Lev 5:12}  And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and burn this on the altar, on the LORD's food offerings; it is a sin offering.
{Lev 5:12}  他要把供物带到祭司那里，祭司要取出自己的一把来作为纪念，按献给耶和华火祭的条例烧在坛上；这是赎罪祭。
{Lev 5:13}  Thus the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in any one of these things, and he shall be forgiven. And the remainder shall be for the priest, as in the grain offering."
{Lev 5:13}  至于他在这几件事中所犯的罪，祭司要为他赎了，他必蒙赦免。剩下的面都归与祭司，和素祭一样。”
{Lev 5:14}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 5:14}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 5:15}  "If anyone commits a breach of faith and sins unintentionally in any of the holy things of the LORD, he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation, a ram without blemish out of the flock, valued in silver shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering.
{Lev 5:15}  “人若在耶和华的圣物上误犯了罪，有了过犯，就要照你所估的，按圣所的舍客勒拿银子，将赎愆祭牲就是羊群中一只没有残疾的公绵羊牵到耶和华面前为赎愆祭；
{Lev 5:16}  He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing and shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest. And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.
{Lev 5:16}  并且他因在圣物上的差错要偿还，另外加五分之一，都给祭司。祭司要用赎愆祭的公绵羊为他赎罪，他必蒙赦免。
{Lev 5:17}  "If anyone sins, doing any of the things that by the LORD's commandments ought not to be done, though he did not know it, then realizes his guilt, he shall bear his iniquity.
{Lev 5:17}  “若有人犯罪，行了耶和华所吩咐不可行的什么事，他虽然不知道，还是有了罪，就要担当他的罪孽；
{Lev 5:18}  He shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent for a guilt offering, and the priest shall make atonement for him for the mistake that he made unintentionally, and he shall be forgiven.
{Lev 5:18}  也要照你所估定的价，从羊群中牵一只没有残疾的公绵羊来，给祭司作赎愆祭。至于他误行的那错事，祭司要为他赎罪，他必蒙赦免。
{Lev 5:19}  It is a guilt offering; he has indeed incurred guilt before the LORD."
{Lev 5:19}  这是赎愆祭，因他在耶和华面前实在有了罪。”
{Lev 6:1}   The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 6:1}   耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 6:2}   "If anyone sins and commits a breach of faith against the LORD by deceiving his neighbor in a matter of deposit or security, or through robbery, or if he has oppressed his neighbor
{Lev 6:2}   “若有人犯罪，干犯耶和华，在邻舍交付他的物上，或是在交易上行了诡诈，或是抢夺人的财物，或是欺压邻舍，
{Lev 6:3}   or has found something lost and lied about it, swearing falsely--in any of all the things that people do and sin thereby--
{Lev 6:3}   或是在捡了遗失的物上行了诡诈，说谎起誓，在这一切的事上犯了什么罪；
{Lev 6:4}   if he has sinned and has realized his guilt and will restore what he took by robbery or what he got by oppression or the deposit that was committed to him or the lost thing that he found
{Lev 6:4}   他既犯了罪，有了过犯，就要归还他所抢夺的，或是因欺压所得的，或是人交付他的，或是人遗失他所捡的物，
{Lev 6:5}   or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full and shall add a fifth to it, and give it to him to whom it belongs on the day he realizes his guilt.
{Lev 6:5}   或是他因什么物起了假誓，就要如数归还，另外加上五分之一，在查出他有罪的日子要交还本主。
{Lev 6:6}   And he shall bring to the priest as his compensation to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent for a guilt offering.
{Lev 6:6}   也要照你所估定的价，把赎愆祭牲，就是羊群中一只没有残疾的公绵羊牵到耶和华面前，给祭司为赎愆祭。
{Lev 6:7}   And the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he shall be forgiven for any of the things that one may do and thereby become guilty."
{Lev 6:7}   祭司要在耶和华面前为他赎罪；他无论行了什么事，使他有了罪，都必蒙赦免。”
{Lev 6:8}   The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 6:8}   耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 6:9}   "Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering. The burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.
{Lev 6:9}   “你要吩咐亚伦和他的子孙说，燔祭的条例乃是这样：燔祭要放在坛的柴上，从晚上到天亮，坛上的火要常常烧着。
{Lev 6:10}  And the priest shall put on his linen garment and put his linen undergarment on his body, and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has reduced the burnt offering on the altar and put them beside the altar.
{Lev 6:10}  祭司要穿上细麻布衣服，又要把细麻布裤子穿在身上，把坛上所烧的燔祭灰收起来，倒在坛的旁边；
{Lev 6:11}  Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
{Lev 6:11}  随后要脱去这衣服，穿上别的衣服，把灰拿到营外洁净之处。
{Lev 6:12}  The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not go out. The priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall arrange the burnt offering on it and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.
{Lev 6:12}  坛上的火要在其上常常烧着，不可熄灭。祭司要每日早晨在上面烧柴，并要把燔祭摆在坛上，在其上烧平安祭牲的脂油。
{Lev 6:13}  Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.
{Lev 6:13}  在坛上必有常常烧着的火，不可熄灭。”
{Lev 6:14}  "And this is the law of the grain offering. The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD in front of the altar.
{Lev 6:14}  “素祭的条例乃是这样：亚伦的子孙要在坛前把这祭献在耶和华面前。
{Lev 6:15}  And one shall take from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering and its oil and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering and burn this as its memorial portion on the altar, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
{Lev 6:15}  祭司要从其中，就是从素祭的细面中取出自己的一把，又要取些油和素祭上所有的乳香，烧在坛上，奉给耶和华为馨香素祭的纪念。
{Lev 6:16}  And the rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten unleavened in a holy place. In the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
{Lev 6:16}  所剩下的，亚伦和他子孙要吃，必在圣处不带酵而吃，要在会幕的院子里吃。
{Lev 6:17}  It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my food offerings. It is a thing most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
{Lev 6:17}  烤的时候不可搀酵。这是从所献给我的火祭中赐给他们的分，是至圣的，和赎罪祭并赎愆祭一样。
{Lev 6:18}  Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as decreed forever throughout your generations, from the LORD's food offerings. Whatever touches them shall become holy."
{Lev 6:18}  凡献给耶和华的火祭，亚伦子孙中的男丁都要吃这一分，直到万代，作他们永得的分。摸这些祭物的，都要成为圣。”
{Lev 6:19}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 6:19}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 6:20}  "This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall offer to the LORD on the day when he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
{Lev 6:20}  “当亚伦受膏的日子，他和他子孙所要献给耶和华的供物，就是细面伊法十分之一，为常献的素祭：早晨一半，晚上一半。
{Lev 6:21}  It shall be made with oil on a griddle. You shall bring it well mixed, in baked pieces like a grain offering, and offer it for a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
{Lev 6:21}  要在铁鏊上用油调和做成，调匀了，你就拿进来；烤好了分成块子，献给耶和华为馨香的素祭。
{Lev 6:22}  The priest from among Aaron's sons, who is anointed to succeed him, shall offer it to the LORD as decreed forever. The whole of it shall be burned.
{Lev 6:22}  亚伦的子孙中，接续他为受膏的祭司，要把这素祭献上，要全烧给耶和华。这是永远的定例。
{Lev 6:23}  Every grain offering of a priest shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten."
{Lev 6:23}  祭司的素祭都要烧了，却不可吃。”
{Lev 6:24}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 6:24}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 6:25}  "Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering. In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD; it is most holy.
{Lev 6:25}  “你对亚伦和他的子孙说，赎罪祭的条例乃是这样：要在耶和华面前、宰燔祭牲的地方宰赎罪祭牲；这是至圣的。
{Lev 6:26}  The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.
{Lev 6:26}  为赎罪献这祭的祭司要吃，要在圣处，就是在会幕的院子里吃。
{Lev 6:27}  Whatever touches its flesh shall be holy, and when any of its blood is splashed on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was splashed in a holy place.
{Lev 6:27}  凡摸这祭肉的要成为圣；这祭牲的血若弹在什么衣服上，所弹的那一件要在圣处洗净。
{Lev 6:28}  And the earthenware vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. But if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, that shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
{Lev 6:28}  惟有煮祭物的瓦器要打碎；若是煮在铜器里，这铜器要擦磨，在水中涮净。
{Lev 6:29}  Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy.
{Lev 6:29}  凡祭司中的男丁都可以吃；这是至圣的。
{Lev 6:30}  But no sin offering shall be eaten from which any blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; it shall be burned up with fire.
{Lev 6:30}  凡赎罪祭，若将血带进会幕在圣所赎罪，那肉都不可吃，必用火焚烧。”
{Lev 7:1}   "This is the law of the guilt offering. It is most holy.
{Lev 7:1}   “赎愆祭的条例乃是如此：这祭是至圣的。
{Lev 7:2}   In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the guilt offering, and its blood shall be thrown against the sides of the altar.
{Lev 7:2}   人在那里宰燔祭牲，也要在那里宰赎愆祭牲；其血，祭司要洒在坛的周围。
{Lev 7:3}   And all its fat shall be offered, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails,
{Lev 7:3}   又要将肥尾巴和盖脏的脂油，
{Lev 7:4}   the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.
{Lev 7:4}   两个腰子和腰子上的脂油，就是靠腰两旁的脂油，并肝上的网子和腰子，一概取下。
{Lev 7:5}   The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering to the LORD; it is a guilt offering.
{Lev 7:5}   祭司要在坛上焚烧，为献给耶和华的火祭，是赎愆祭。
{Lev 7:6}   Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy.
{Lev 7:6}   祭司中的男丁都可以吃这祭物；要在圣处吃，是至圣的。
{Lev 7:7}   The guilt offering is just like the sin offering; there is one law for them. The priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.
{Lev 7:7}   赎罪祭怎样，赎愆祭也是怎样，两个祭是一个条例。献赎愆祭赎罪的祭司要得这祭物。
{Lev 7:8}   And the priest who offers any man's burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered.
{Lev 7:8}   献燔祭的祭司，无论为谁奉献，要亲自得他所献那燔祭牲的皮。
{Lev 7:9}   And every grain offering baked in the oven and all that is prepared on a pan or a griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it.
{Lev 7:9}   凡在炉中烤的素祭和煎盘中做的，并铁鏊上做的，都要归那献祭的祭司。
{Lev 7:10}  And every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall be shared equally among all the sons of Aaron.
{Lev 7:10}  凡素祭，无论是油调和的是干的，都要归亚伦的子孙，大家均分。”
{Lev 7:11}  "And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that one may offer to the LORD.
{Lev 7:11}  “人献与耶和华平安祭的条例乃是这样：
{Lev 7:12}  If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the thanksgiving sacrifice unleavened loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and loaves of fine flour well mixed with oil.
{Lev 7:12}  他若为感谢献上，就要用调油的无酵饼和抹油的无酵薄饼，并用油调匀细面做的饼，与感谢祭一同献上。
{Lev 7:13}  With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with loaves of leavened bread.
{Lev 7:13}  要用有酵的饼和为感谢献的平安祭，与供物一同献上。
{Lev 7:14}  And from it he shall offer one loaf from each offering, as a gift to the LORD. It shall belong to the priest who throws the blood of the peace offerings.
{Lev 7:14}  从各样的供物中，他要把一个饼献给耶和华为举祭，是要归给洒平安祭牲血的祭司。
{Lev 7:15}  And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.
{Lev 7:15}  为感谢献平安祭牲的肉，要在献的日子吃，一点不可留到早晨。
{Lev 7:16}  But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten.
{Lev 7:16}  若所献的是为还愿，或是甘心献的，必在献祭的日子吃，所剩下的第二天也可以吃。
{Lev 7:17}  But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned up with fire.
{Lev 7:17}  但所剩下的祭肉，到第三天要用火焚烧；
{Lev 7:18}  If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten on the third day, he who offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to him. It is tainted, and he who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
{Lev 7:18}  第三天若吃了平安祭的肉，这祭必不蒙悦纳，人所献的也不算为祭，反为可憎嫌的，吃这祭肉的，就必担当他的罪孽。
{Lev 7:19}  "Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned up with fire. All who are clean may eat flesh,
{Lev 7:19}  “挨了污秽物的肉就不可吃，要用火焚烧。至于平安祭的肉，凡洁净的人都要吃；
{Lev 7:20}  but the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the LORD's peace offerings while an uncleanness is on him, that person shall be cut off from his people.
{Lev 7:20}  只是献与耶和华平安祭的肉，人若不洁净而吃了，这人必从民中剪除。
{Lev 7:21}  And if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether human uncleanness or an unclean beast or any unclean detestable creature, and then eats some flesh from the sacrifice of the LORD's peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from his people."
{Lev 7:21}  有人摸了什么不洁净的物，或是人的不洁净，或是不洁净的牲畜，或是不洁可憎之物，吃了献与耶和华平安祭的肉，这人必从民中剪除。”
{Lev 7:22}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 7:22}  耶和华对摩西说：
{Lev 7:23}  "Speak to the people of Israel, saying, You shall eat no fat, of ox or sheep or goat.
{Lev 7:23}  “你晓谕以色列人说：牛的脂油、绵羊的脂油、山羊的脂油，你们都不可吃。
{Lev 7:24}  The fat of an animal that dies of itself and the fat of one that is torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but on no account shall you eat it.
{Lev 7:24}  自死的和被野兽撕裂的，那脂油可以做别的使用，只是你们万不可吃。
{Lev 7:25}  For every person who eats of the fat of an animal of which a food offering may be made to the LORD shall be cut off from his people.
{Lev 7:25}  无论何人吃了献给耶和华当火祭牲畜的脂油，那人必从民中剪除。
{Lev 7:26}  Moreover, you shall eat no blood whatever, whether of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwelling places.
{Lev 7:26}  在你们一切的住处，无论是雀鸟的血是野兽的血，你们都不可吃。
{Lev 7:27}  Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people."
{Lev 7:27}  无论是谁吃血，那人必从民中剪除。”
{Lev 7:28}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 7:28}  耶和华对摩西说：
{Lev 7:29}  "Speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD shall bring his offering to the LORD from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
{Lev 7:29}  “你晓谕以色列人说：献平安祭给耶和华的，要从平安祭中取些来奉给耶和华。
{Lev 7:30}  His own hands shall bring the LORD's food offerings. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the LORD.
{Lev 7:30}  他亲手献给耶和华的火祭，就是脂油和胸，要带来，好把胸在耶和华面前作摇祭，摇一摇。
{Lev 7:31}  The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.
{Lev 7:31}  祭司要把脂油在坛上焚烧，但胸要归亚伦和他的子孙。
{Lev 7:32}  And the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifice of your peace offerings.
{Lev 7:32}  你们要从平安祭中把右腿作举祭，奉给祭司。
{Lev 7:33}  Whoever among the sons of Aaron offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for a portion.
{Lev 7:33}  亚伦子孙中，献平安祭牲血和脂油的，要得这右腿为分；
{Lev 7:34}  For the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed I have taken from the people of Israel, out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel.
{Lev 7:34}  因为我从以色列人的平安祭中，取了这摇的胸和举的腿给祭司亚伦和他子孙，作他们从以色列人中所永得的分。”
{Lev 7:35}  This is the portion of Aaron and of his sons from the LORD's food offerings, from the day they were presented to serve as priests of the LORD.
{Lev 7:35}  这是从耶和华火祭中，作亚伦受膏的分和他子孙受膏的分，正在摩西（原文作他）叫他们前来给耶和华供祭司职分的日子，
{Lev 7:36}  The LORD commanded this to be given them by the people of Israel, from the day that he anointed them. It is a perpetual due throughout their generations."
{Lev 7:36}  就是在摩西（原文作他）膏他们的日子，耶和华吩咐以色列人给他们的。这是他们世世代代永得的分。
{Lev 7:37}  This is the law of the burnt offering, of the grain offering, of the sin offering, of the guilt offering, of the ordination offering, and of the peace offering,
{Lev 7:37}  这就是燔祭、素祭、赎罪祭、赎愆祭，和平安祭的条例，并承接圣职的礼，
{Lev 7:38}  which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that he commanded the people of Israel to bring their offerings to the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.
{Lev 7:38}  都是耶和华在西乃山所吩咐摩西的，就是他在西乃旷野吩咐以色列人献供物给耶和华之日所说的。
{Lev 8:1}   The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 8:1}   耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 8:2}   "Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread.
{Lev 8:2}   “你将亚伦和他儿子一同带来，并将圣衣、膏油，与赎罪祭的一只公牛、两只公绵羊、一筐无酵饼都带来，
{Lev 8:3}   And assemble all the congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting."
{Lev 8:3}   又招聚会众到会幕门口。”
{Lev 8:4}   And Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
{Lev 8:4}   摩西就照耶和华所吩咐的行了；于是会众聚集在会幕门口。
{Lev 8:5}   And Moses said to the congregation, "This is the thing that the LORD has commanded to be done."
{Lev 8:5}   摩西告诉会众说：“这就是耶和华所吩咐当行的事。”
{Lev 8:6}   And Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
{Lev 8:6}   摩西带了亚伦和他儿子来，用水洗了他们。
{Lev 8:7}   And he put the coat on him and tied the sash around his waist and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him and tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod around him, binding it to him with the band.
{Lev 8:7}   给亚伦穿上内袍，束上腰带，穿上外袍，又加上以弗得，用其上巧工织的带子把以弗得系在他身上，
{Lev 8:8}   And he placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.
{Lev 8:8}   又给他戴上胸牌，把乌陵和土明放在胸牌内，
{Lev 8:9}   And he set the turban on his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown, as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Lev 8:9}   把冠冕戴在他头上，在冠冕的前面钉上金牌，就是圣冠，都是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的。

{Lev 8:10}  摩西用膏油抹帐幕和其中所有的，使他成圣；
{Lev 8:11}  And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
{Lev 8:11}  又用膏油在坛上弹了七次，又抹了坛和坛的一切器皿，并洗濯盆和盆座，使他成圣；

{Lev 8:14}  Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.
{Lev 8:14}  他牵了赎罪祭的公牛来，亚伦和他儿子按手在赎罪祭公牛的头上，
{Lev 8:15}  And he killed it, and Moses took the blood, and with his finger put it on the horns of the altar around it and purified the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it to make atonement for it.
{Lev 8:15}  就宰了公牛。摩西用指头蘸血，抹在坛上四角的周围，使坛洁净，把血倒在坛的脚那里，使坛成圣，坛就洁净了；
{Lev 8:16}  And he took all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.
{Lev 8:16}  又取脏上所有的脂油和肝上的网子，并两个腰子与腰子上的脂油，都烧在坛上；
{Lev 8:17}  But the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung he burned up with fire outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Lev 8:17}  惟有公牛，连皮带肉并粪，用火烧在营外，都是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的。
{Lev 8:18}  Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.

{Lev 8:23}  And he killed it, and Moses took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
{Lev 8:23}  就宰了羊。摩西把些血抹在亚伦的右耳垂上和右手的大拇指上，并右脚的大拇指上，
{Lev 8:24}  Then he presented Aaron's sons, and Moses put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar.
{Lev 8:24}  又带了亚伦的儿子来，把些血抹在他们的右耳垂上和右手的大拇指上，并右脚的大拇指上，又把血洒在坛的周围。
{Lev 8:25}  Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and the right thigh,
{Lev 8:25}  取脂油和肥尾巴，并脏上一切的脂油与肝上的网子，两个腰子和腰子上的脂油，并右腿，
{Lev 8:26}  and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD he took one unleavened loaf and one loaf of bread with oil and one wafer and placed them on the pieces of fat and on the right thigh.
{Lev 8:26}  再从耶和华面前、盛无酵饼的筐子里取出一个无酵饼，一个油饼，一个薄饼，都放在脂油和右腿上，
{Lev 8:27}  And he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before the LORD.
{Lev 8:27}  把这一切放在亚伦的手上和他儿子的手上作摇祭，在耶和华面前摇一摇。
{Lev 8:28}  Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD.
{Lev 8:28}  摩西从他们的手上拿下来，烧在坛上的燔祭上，都是为承接圣职献给耶和华馨香的火祭。
{Lev 8:29}  And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD. It was Moses' portion of the ram of ordination, as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Lev 8:29}  摩西拿羊的胸作为摇祭，在耶和华面前摇一摇，是承接圣职之礼，归摩西的分，都是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的。
{Lev 8:30}  Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and his sons' garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons' garments with him.
{Lev 8:30}  摩西取点膏油和坛上的血，弹在亚伦和他的衣服上，并他儿子和他儿子的衣服上，使他和他们的衣服一同成圣。
{Lev 8:31}  And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, "Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.'
{Lev 8:31}  摩西对亚伦和他儿子说：“把肉煮在会幕门口，在那里吃，又吃承接圣职筐子里的饼，按我所吩咐的说（或作：按所吩咐我的说）：‘这是亚伦和他儿子要吃的。’
{Lev 8:32}  And what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn up with fire.
{Lev 8:32}  剩下的肉和饼，你们要用火焚烧。
{Lev 8:33}  And you shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for it will take seven days to ordain you.
{Lev 8:33}  你们七天不可出会幕的门，等到你们承接圣职的日子满了，因为主叫你们七天承接圣职。
{Lev 8:34}  As has been done today, the LORD has commanded to be done to make atonement for you.
{Lev 8:34}  像今天所行的都是耶和华吩咐行的，为你们赎罪。
{Lev 8:35}  At the entrance of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days, performing what the LORD has charged, so that you do not die, for so I have been commanded."
{Lev 8:35}  七天你们要昼夜住在会幕门口，遵守耶和华的吩咐，免得你们死亡，因为所吩咐我的就是这样。”
{Lev 8:36}  And Aaron and his sons did all the things that the LORD commanded by Moses.
{Lev 8:36}  于是亚伦和他儿子行了耶和华藉着摩西所吩咐的一切事。
{Lev 9:1}   On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel,
{Lev 9:1}   到了第八天，摩西召了亚伦和他儿子，并以色列的众长老来，
{Lev 9:2}   and he said to Aaron, "Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
{Lev 9:2}   对亚伦说：“你当取牛群中的一只公牛犊作赎罪祭，一只公绵羊作燔祭，都要没有残疾的，献在耶和华面前。
{Lev 9:3}   And say to the people of Israel, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering,
{Lev 9:3}   你也要对以色列人说：‘你们当取一只公山羊作赎罪祭，又取一只牛犊和一只绵羊羔，都要一岁、没有残疾的，作燔祭，
{Lev 9:4}   and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today the LORD will appear to you.'"
{Lev 9:4}   又取一只公牛，一只公绵羊作平安祭，献在耶和华面前，并取调油的素祭，因为今天耶和华要向你们显现。’
{Lev 9:5}   And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
{Lev 9:5}   于是他们把摩西所吩咐的，带到会幕前；全会众都近前来，站在耶和华面前。
{Lev 9:6}   And Moses said, "This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."
{Lev 9:6}   摩西说：“这是耶和华吩咐你们所当行的；耶和华的荣光就要向你们显现。”
{Lev 9:7}   Then Moses said to Aaron, "Draw near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and for the people, and bring the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded."
{Lev 9:7}   摩西对亚伦说：“你就近坛前，献你的赎罪祭和燔祭，为自己与百姓赎罪，又献上百姓的供物，为他们赎罪，都照耶和华所吩咐的。”
{Lev 9:8}   So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
{Lev 9:8}   于是，亚伦就近坛前，宰了为自己作赎罪祭的牛犊。
{Lev 9:9}   And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.
{Lev 9:9}   亚伦的儿子把血奉给他，他就把指头蘸在血中，抹在坛的四角上，又把血倒在坛脚那里。
{Lev 9:10}  But the fat and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Lev 9:10}  惟有赎罪祭的脂油和腰子，并肝上取的网子，都烧在坛上，是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的；
{Lev 9:11}  The flesh and the skin he burned up with fire outside the camp.
{Lev 9:11}  又用火将肉和皮烧在营外。
{Lev 9:12}  Then he killed the burnt offering, and Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar.
{Lev 9:12}  亚伦宰了燔祭牲，他儿子把血递给他，他就洒在坛的周围，
{Lev 9:13}  And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar.
{Lev 9:13}  又把燔祭一块一块地、连头递给他，他都烧在坛上；
{Lev 9:14}  And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
{Lev 9:14}  又洗了脏腑和腿，烧在坛上的燔祭上。
{Lev 9:15}  Then he presented the people's offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and killed it and offered it as a sin offering, like the first one.
{Lev 9:15}  他奉上百姓的供物，把那给百姓作赎罪祭的公山羊宰了，为罪献上，和先献的一样；
{Lev 9:16}  And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the rule.
{Lev 9:16}  也奉上燔祭，照例而献。
{Lev 9:17}  And he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
{Lev 9:17}  他又奉上素祭，从其中取一满把，烧在坛上；这是在早晨的燔祭以外。
{Lev 9:18}  Then he killed the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people. And Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar.
{Lev 9:18}  亚伦宰了那给百姓作平安祭的公牛和公绵羊。他儿子把血递给他，他就洒在坛的周围；
{Lev 9:19}  But the fat pieces of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail and that which covers the entrails and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver--
{Lev 9:19}  又把公牛和公绵羊的脂油、肥尾巴，并盖脏的脂油与腰子，和肝上的网子，都递给他；
{Lev 9:20}  they put the fat pieces on the breasts, and he burned the fat pieces on the altar,
{Lev 9:20}  把脂油放在胸上，他就把脂油烧在坛上。
{Lev 9:21}  but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses commanded.
{Lev 9:21}  胸和右腿，亚伦当作摇祭，在耶和华面前摇一摇，都是照摩西所吩咐的。
{Lev 9:22}  Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.
{Lev 9:22}  亚伦向百姓举手，为他们祝福。他献了赎罪祭、燔祭、平安祭就下来了。
{Lev 9:23}  And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
{Lev 9:23}  摩西、亚伦进入会幕，又出来为百姓祝福，耶和华的荣光就向众民显现。
{Lev 9:24}  And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.
{Lev 9:24}  有火从耶和华面前出来，在坛上烧尽燔祭和脂油；众民一见，就都欢呼，俯伏在地。
{Lev 10:1}  Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, which he had not commanded them.
{Lev 10:1}  亚伦的儿子拿答、亚比户各拿自己的香炉，盛上火，加上香，在耶和华面前献上凡火，是耶和华没有吩咐他们的，
{Lev 10:2}  And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
{Lev 10:2}  就有火从耶和华面前出来，把他们烧灭，他们就死在耶和华面前。
{Lev 10:3}  Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD has said: 'Among those who are near me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.'" And Aaron held his peace.
{Lev 10:3}  于是摩西对亚伦说：“这就是耶和华所说：‘我在亲近我的人中要显为圣；在众民面前，我要得荣耀。’”亚伦就默默不言。
{Lev 10:4}  And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, "Come near; carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary and out of the camp."
{Lev 10:4}  摩西召了亚伦叔父乌薛的儿子米沙利、以利撒反来，对他们说：“上前来，把你们的亲属从圣所前抬到营外。”
{Lev 10:5}  So they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
{Lev 10:5}  于是二人上前来，把他们穿着袍子抬到营外，是照摩西所吩咐的。
{Lev 10:6}  And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, "Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your clothes, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the LORD has kindled.
{Lev 10:6}  摩西对亚伦和他儿子以利亚撒、以他玛说：“不可蓬头散发，也不可撕裂衣裳，免得你们死亡，又免得耶和华向会众发怒；只要你们的弟兄以色列全家为耶和华所发的火哀哭。
{Lev 10:7}  And do not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you." And they did according to the word of Moses.
{Lev 10:7}  你们也不可出会幕的门，恐怕你们死亡，因为耶和华的膏油在你们的身上。”他们就照摩西的话行了。
{Lev 10:8}  And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,
{Lev 10:8}  耶和华晓谕亚伦说：
{Lev 10:9}  "Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
{Lev 10:9}  “你和你儿子进会幕的时候，清酒、浓酒都不可喝，免得你们死亡；这要作你们世世代代永远的定例。
{Lev 10:10} You are to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,
{Lev 10:10} 使你们可以将圣的、俗的，洁净的、不洁净的，分别出来；
{Lev 10:11} and you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the LORD has spoken to them by Moses."
{Lev 10:11} 又使你们可以将耶和华藉摩西晓谕以色列人的一切律例教训他们。”
{Lev 10:12} Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons: "Take the grain offering that is left of the LORD's food offerings, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.
{Lev 10:12} 摩西对亚伦和他剩下的儿子以利亚撒、以他玛说：“你们献给耶和华火祭中所剩的素祭，要在坛旁不带酵而吃，因为是至圣的。
{Lev 10:13} You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons' due, from the LORD's food offerings, for so I am commanded.
{Lev 10:13} 你们要在圣处吃；因为在献给耶和华的火祭中，这是你的分和你儿子的分；所吩咐我的本是这样。
{Lev 10:14} But the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons' due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel.
{Lev 10:14} 所摇的胸，所举的腿，你们要在洁净地方吃。你和你的儿女都要同吃；因为这些是从以色列人平安祭中给你，当你的分和你儿子的分。
{Lev 10:15} The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the LORD, and it shall be yours and your sons' with you as a due forever, as the LORD has commanded."
{Lev 10:15} 所举的腿，所摇的胸，他们要与火祭的脂油一同带来当摇祭，在耶和华面前摇一摇；这要归你和你儿子，当作永得的分，都是照耶和华所吩咐的。”
{Lev 10:16} Now Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying,
{Lev 10:16} 当下摩西急切地寻找作赎罪祭的公山羊，谁知已经焚烧了，便向亚伦剩下的儿子以利亚撒、以他玛发怒，说：
{Lev 10:17} "Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
{Lev 10:17} “这赎罪祭既是至圣的，主又给了你们，为要你们担当会众的罪孽，在耶和华面前为他们赎罪，你们为何没有在圣所吃呢？
{Lev 10:18} Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded."
{Lev 10:18} 看哪，这祭牲的血并没有拿到圣所里去，你们本当照我所吩咐的，在圣所里吃这祭肉。”
{Lev 10:19} And Aaron said to Moses, "Behold, today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, and yet such things as these have happened to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would the LORD have approved?"
{Lev 10:19} 亚伦对摩西说：“今天他们在耶和华面前献上赎罪祭和燔祭，我又遇见这样的灾，若今天吃了赎罪祭，耶和华岂能看为美呢？”
{Lev 10:20} And when Moses heard that, he approved.
{Lev 10:20} 摩西听见这话，便以为美。
{Lev 11:1}  And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them,
{Lev 11:1}  耶和华对摩西、亚伦说：
{Lev 11:2}  "Speak to the people of Israel, saying, These are the living things that you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth.
{Lev 11:2}  “你们晓谕以色列人说，在地上一切走兽中可吃的乃是这些：
{Lev 11:3}  Whatever parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat.
{Lev 11:3}  凡蹄分两瓣、倒嚼的走兽，你们都可以吃。
{Lev 11:4}  Nevertheless, among those that chew the cud or part the hoof, you shall not eat these: The camel, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you.
{Lev 11:4}  但那倒嚼或分蹄之中不可吃的乃是：骆驼因为倒嚼不分蹄，就与你们不洁净；
{Lev 11:5}  And the rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you.

{Lev 11:8}  You shall not eat any of their flesh, and you shall not touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.
{Lev 11:8}  这些兽的肉，你们不可吃；死的，你们不可摸，都与你们不洁净。
{Lev 11:9}  "These you may eat, of all that are in the waters. Everything in the waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat.
{Lev 11:9}  “水中可吃的乃是这些：凡在水里、海里、河里、有翅有鳞的，都可以吃。
{Lev 11:10} But anything in the seas or the rivers that does not have fins and scales, of the swarming creatures in the waters and of the living creatures that are in the waters, is detestable to you.
{Lev 11:10} 凡在海里、河里，并一切水里游动的活物，无翅无鳞的，你们都当以为可憎。

{Lev 11:21} Yet among the winged insects that go on all fours you may eat those that have jointed legs above their feet, with which to hop on the ground.
{Lev 11:21} 只是有翅膀用四足爬行的物中，有足有腿，在地上蹦跳的，你们还可以吃。

{Lev 11:44} 我是耶和华你们的神；所以你们要成为圣洁，因为我是圣洁的。你们也不可在地上的爬物污秽自己。
{Lev 11:45} For I am the LORD who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God. You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy."
{Lev 11:45} 我是把你们从埃及地领出来的耶和华，要作你们的神；所以你们要圣洁，因为我是圣洁的。”
{Lev 11:46} This is the law about beast and bird and every living creature that moves through the waters and every creature that swarms on the ground,
{Lev 11:46} 这是走兽、飞鸟，和水中游动的活物，并地上爬物的条例。
{Lev 11:47} to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean and between the living creature that may be eaten and the living creature that may not be eaten.
{Lev 11:47} 要把洁净的和不洁净的，可吃的与不可吃的活物，都分别出来。
{Lev 12:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 12:1}  耶和华对摩西说：
{Lev 12:2}  "Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If a woman conceives and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days. As at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean.
{Lev 12:2}  “你晓谕以色列人说：若有妇人怀孕生男孩，他就不洁净七天，像在月经污秽的日子不洁净一样。
{Lev 12:3}  And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
{Lev 12:3}  第八天，要给婴孩行割礼。
{Lev 12:4}  Then she shall continue for thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying. She shall not touch anything holy, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.
{Lev 12:4}  妇人在产血不洁之中，要家居三十三天。他洁净的日子未满，不可摸圣物，也不可进入圣所。
{Lev 12:5}  But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation. And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying for sixty-six days.
{Lev 12:5}  他若生女孩，就不洁净两个七天，像污秽的时候一样，要在产血不洁之中，家居六十六天。
{Lev 12:6}  "And when the days of her purifying are completed, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a lamb a year old for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering,
{Lev 12:6}  “满了洁净的日子，无论是为男孩是为女孩，他要把一岁的羊羔为燔祭，一只雏鸽或是一只斑鸠为赎罪祭，带到会幕门口交给祭司。
{Lev 12:7}  and he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her. Then she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, either male or female.
{Lev 12:7}  祭司要献在耶和华面前，为他赎罪，他的血源就洁净了。这条例是为生育的妇人，无论是生男生女。
{Lev 12:8}  And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean."
{Lev 12:8}  他的力量若不够献一只羊羔，他就要取两只斑鸠或是两只雏鸽，一只为燔祭，一只为赎罪祭。祭司要为他赎罪，他就洁净了。”
{Lev 13:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
{Lev 13:1}  耶和华晓谕摩西、亚伦说：
{Lev 13:2}  "When a person has on the skin of his body a swelling or an eruption or a spot, and it turns into a case of leprous disease on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests,
{Lev 13:2}  “人的肉皮上若长了疖子，或长了癣，或长了火斑，在他肉皮上成了大麻疯的灾病，就要将他带到祭司亚伦或亚伦作祭司的一个子孙面前。
{Lev 13:3}  and the priest shall examine the diseased area on the skin of his body. And if the hair in the diseased area has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a case of leprous disease. When the priest has examined him, he shall pronounce him unclean.
{Lev 13:3}  祭司要察看肉皮上的灾病，若灾病处的毛已经变白，灾病的现象深于肉上的皮，这便是大麻疯的灾病。祭司要察看他，定他为不洁净。
{Lev 13:4}  But if the spot is white in the skin of his body and appears no deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall shut up the diseased person for seven days.
{Lev 13:4}  若火斑在他肉皮上是白的，现象不深于皮，其上的毛也没有变白，祭司就要将有灾病的人关锁七天。
{Lev 13:5}  And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up for another seven days.
{Lev 13:5}  第七天，祭司要察看他，若看灾病止住了，没有在皮上发散，祭司还要将他关锁七天。
{Lev 13:6}  And the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the diseased area has faded and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only an eruption. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
{Lev 13:6}  第七天，祭司要再察看他，若灾病发暗，而且没有在皮上发散，祭司要定他为洁净，原来是癣；那人就要洗衣服，得为洁净。
{Lev 13:7}  But if the eruption spreads in the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest.
{Lev 13:7}  但他为得洁净，将身体给祭司察看以后，癣若在皮上发散开了，他要再将身体给祭司察看。
{Lev 13:8}  And the priest shall look, and if the eruption has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.
{Lev 13:8}  祭司要察看，癣若在皮上发散，就要定他为不洁净，是大麻疯。
{Lev 13:9}  "When a man is afflicted with a leprous disease, he shall be brought to the priest,
{Lev 13:9}  “人有了大麻疯的灾病，就要将他带到祭司面前。
{Lev 13:10} and the priest shall look. And if there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,
{Lev 13:10} 祭司要察看，皮上若长了白疖，使毛变白，在长白疖之处有了红瘀肉，
{Lev 13:11} it is a chronic leprous disease in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
{Lev 13:11} 这是肉皮上的旧大麻疯，祭司要定他为不洁净，不用将他关锁，因为他是不洁净了。
{Lev 13:12} And if the leprous disease breaks out in the skin, so that the leprous disease covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see,
{Lev 13:12} 大麻疯若在皮上四外发散，长满了患灾病人的皮，据祭司察看，从头到脚无处不有，
{Lev 13:13} then the priest shall look, and if the leprous disease has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; it has all turned white, and he is clean.
{Lev 13:13} 祭司就要察看，全身的肉若长满了大麻疯，就要定那患灾病的为洁净；全身都变为白，他乃洁净了。
{Lev 13:14} But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.
{Lev 13:14} 但红肉几时显在他的身上就几时不洁净。
{Lev 13:15} And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean. Raw flesh is unclean, for it is a leprous disease.
{Lev 13:15} 祭司一看那红肉就定他为不洁净。红肉本是不洁净，是大麻疯。
{Lev 13:16} But if the raw flesh recovers and turns white again, then he shall come to the priest,
{Lev 13:16} 红肉若复原，又变白了，他就要来见祭司。
{Lev 13:17} and the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean; he is clean.
{Lev 13:17} 祭司要察看，灾病处若变白了，祭司就要定那患灾病的为洁净，他乃洁净了。
{Lev 13:18} "If there is in the skin of one's body a boil and it heals,
{Lev 13:18} “人若在皮肉上长疮，却治好了，
{Lev 13:19} and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a reddish-white spot, then it shall be shown to the priest.
{Lev 13:19} 在长疮之处又起了白疖，或是白中带红的火斑，就要给祭司察看。
{Lev 13:20} And the priest shall look, and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a case of leprous disease that has broken out in the boil.
{Lev 13:20} 祭司要察看，若现象洼于皮，其上的毛也变白了，就要定他为不洁净，是大麻疯的灾病发在疮中。
{Lev 13:21} But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.
{Lev 13:21} 祭司若察看，其上没有白毛，也没有洼于皮，乃是发暗，就要将他关锁七天。
{Lev 13:22} And if it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a disease.
{Lev 13:22} 若在皮上发散开了，祭司就要定他为不洁净，是灾病。
{Lev 13:23} But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
{Lev 13:23} 火斑若在原处止住，没有发散，便是疮的痕迹，祭司就要定他为洁净。
{Lev 13:24} "Or, when the body has a burn on its skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot, reddish-white or white,
{Lev 13:24} “人的皮肉上若起了火毒，火毒的瘀肉成了火斑，或是白中带红的，或是全白的，
{Lev 13:25} the priest shall examine it, and if the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, then it is a leprous disease. It has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a case of leprous disease.
{Lev 13:25} 祭司就要察看，火斑中的毛若变白了，现象又深于皮，是大麻疯在火毒中发出，就要定他为不洁净，是大麻疯的灾病。
{Lev 13:26} But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the spot and it is no deeper than the skin, but has faded, the priest shall shut him up seven days,
{Lev 13:26} 但是祭司察看，在火斑中若没有白毛，也没有洼于皮，乃是发暗，就要将他关锁七天。
{Lev 13:27} and the priest shall examine him the seventh day. If it is spreading in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a case of leprous disease.
{Lev 13:27} 到第七天，祭司要察看他，火斑若在皮上发散开了，就要定他为不洁净，是大麻疯的灾病。
{Lev 13:28} But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread in the skin, but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar of the burn.
{Lev 13:28} 火斑若在原处止住，没有在皮上发散，乃是发暗，是起的火毒，祭司要定他为洁净，不过是火毒的痕迹。
{Lev 13:29} "When a man or woman has a disease on the head or the beard,
{Lev 13:29} “无论男女，若在头上有灾病，或是男人胡须上有灾病，
{Lev 13:30} the priest shall examine the disease. And if it appears deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is an itch, a leprous disease of the head or the beard.
{Lev 13:30} 祭司就要察看；这灾病现象若深于皮，其间有细黄毛，就要定他为不洁净，这是头疥，是头上或是胡须上的大麻疯。
{Lev 13:31} And if the priest examines the itching disease and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days,
{Lev 13:31} 祭司若察看头疥的灾病，现象不深于皮，其间也没有黑毛，就要将长头疥灾病的关锁七天。
{Lev 13:32} and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the disease. If the itch has not spread, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin,
{Lev 13:32} 第七天，祭司要察看灾病，若头疥没有发散，其间也没有黄毛，头疥的现象不深于皮，
{Lev 13:33} then he shall shave himself, but the itch he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for another seven days.
{Lev 13:33} 那人就要剃去须发，但他不可剃头疥之处。祭司要将那长头疥的，再关锁七天。
{Lev 13:34} And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch, and if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
{Lev 13:34} 第七天，祭司要察看头疥，头疥若没有在皮上发散，现象也不深于皮，就要定他为洁净，他要洗衣服，便成为洁净。
{Lev 13:35} But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing,
{Lev 13:35} 但他得洁净以后，头疥若在皮上发散开了，
{Lev 13:36} then the priest shall examine him, and if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
{Lev 13:36} 祭司就要察看他。头疥若在皮上发散，就不必找那黄毛，他是不洁净了。
{Lev 13:37} But if in his eyes the itch is unchanged and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed and he is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
{Lev 13:37} 祭司若看头疥已经止住，其间也长了黑毛，头疥已然痊愈，那人是洁净了，就要定他为洁净。
{Lev 13:38} "When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots,
{Lev 13:38} “无论男女，皮肉上若起了火斑，就是白火斑，

{Lev 13:42} But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white diseased area, it is a leprous disease breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.
{Lev 13:42} 头秃处或是顶门秃处若有白中带红的灾病，这就是大麻疯发在他头秃处或是顶门秃处，
{Lev 13:43} Then the priest shall examine him, and if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprous disease in the skin of the body,
{Lev 13:43} 祭司就要察看，他起的那灾病若在头秃处或是顶门秃处有白中带红的，像肉皮上大麻疯的现象，
{Lev 13:44} he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest must pronounce him unclean; his disease is on his head.
{Lev 13:44} 那人就是长大麻疯，不洁净的，祭司总要定他为不洁净，他的灾病是在头上。
{Lev 13:45} "The leprous person who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head hang loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out, 'Unclean, unclean.'
{Lev 13:45} “身上有长大麻疯灾病的，他的衣服要撕裂，也要蓬头散发，蒙着上唇，喊叫说：‘不洁净了！不洁净了！’
{Lev 13:46} He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease. He is unclean. He shall live alone. His dwelling shall be outside the camp.
{Lev 13:46} 灾病在他身上的日子，他便是不洁净；他既是不洁净，就要独居营外。”
{Lev 13:47} "When there is a case of leprous disease in a garment, whether a woolen or a linen garment,

{Lev 13:54} 祭司就要吩咐他们，把染了灾病的物件洗了，再关锁七天。
{Lev 13:55} And the priest shall examine the diseased thing after it has been washed. And if the appearance of the diseased area has not changed, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean. You shall burn it in the fire, whether the rot is on the back or on the front.
{Lev 13:55} 洗过以后，祭司要察看，那物件若没有变色，灾病也没有消散，那物件就不洁净，是透重的灾病，无论正面反面，都要在火中焚烧。
{Lev 13:56} "But if the priest examines, and if the diseased area has faded after it has been washed, he shall tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof.
{Lev 13:56} 洗过以后，祭司要察看，若见那灾病发暗，他就要把那灾病从衣服上，皮子上，经上、纬上，都撕去。
{Lev 13:57} Then if it appears again in the garment, in the warp or the woof, or in any article made of skin, it is spreading. You shall burn with fire whatever has the disease.
{Lev 13:57} 若仍现在衣服上，或是经上、纬上、皮子做的什么物件上，这就是灾病又发了，必用火焚烧那染灾病的物件。
{Lev 13:58} But the garment, or the warp or the woof, or any article made of skin from which the disease departs when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and be clean."
{Lev 13:58} 所洗的衣服，或是经，或是纬，或是皮子做的什么物件，若灾病离开了，要再洗，就洁净了。”
{Lev 13:59} This is the law for a case of leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or the woof, or in any article made of skin, to determine whether it is clean or unclean.
{Lev 13:59} 这就是大麻疯灾病的条例，无论是在羊毛衣服上，麻布衣服上，经上、纬上，和皮子做的什么物件上，可以定为洁净或是不洁净。
{Lev 14:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 14:1}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 14:2}  "This shall be the law of the leprous person for the day of his cleansing. He shall be brought to the priest,
{Lev 14:2}  “长大麻疯得洁净的日子，其例乃是这样：要带他去见祭司；

{Lev 14:3}  祭司要出到营外察看，若见他的大麻疯痊愈了，
{Lev 14:4}  the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two live clean birds and cedarwood and scarlet yarn and hyssop.
{Lev 14:4}  就要吩咐人为那求洁净的拿两只洁净的活鸟和香柏木、朱红色线，并牛膝草来。
{Lev 14:5}  And the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthenware vessel over fresh water.
{Lev 14:5}  祭司要吩咐用瓦器盛活水，把一只鸟宰在上面。

{Lev 14:6}  至于那只活鸟，祭司要把他和香柏木、朱红色线并牛膝草一同蘸于宰在活水上的鸟血中，
{Lev 14:7}  And he shall sprinkle it seven times on him who is to be cleansed of the leprous disease. Then he shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird go into the open field.
{Lev 14:7}  用以在那长大麻疯求洁净的人身上洒七次，就定他为洁净，又把活鸟放在田野里。
{Lev 14:8}  And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean. And after that he may come into the camp, but live outside his tent seven days.
{Lev 14:8}  求洁净的人当洗衣服，剃去毛发，用水洗澡，就洁净了；然后可以进营，只是要在自己的帐棚外居住七天。
{Lev 14:9}  And on the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair from his head, his beard, and his eyebrows. He shall shave off all his hair, and then he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.

{Lev 14:13} And he shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary. For the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
{Lev 14:13} 把公羊羔宰于圣地，就是宰赎罪祭牲和燔祭牲之地。赎愆祭要归祭司，与赎罪祭一样，是至圣的。
{Lev 14:14} The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.

{Lev 14:17} 将手里所剩的油抹在那求洁净人的右耳垂上和右手的大拇指上，并右脚的大拇指上，就是抹在赎愆祭牲的血上。
{Lev 14:18} And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD.
{Lev 14:18} 祭司手里所剩的油要抹在那求洁净人的头上，在耶和华面前为他赎罪。
{Lev 14:19} The priest shall offer the sin offering, to make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he shall kill the burnt offering.
{Lev 14:19} 祭司要献赎罪祭，为那本不洁净、求洁净的人赎罪；然后要宰燔祭牲，

{Lev 14:22} also two turtledoves or two pigeons, whichever he can afford. The one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
{Lev 14:22} 又照他的力量取两只斑鸠或是两只雏鸽，一只作赎罪祭，一只作燔祭。
{Lev 14:23} And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, before the LORD.
{Lev 14:23} 第八天，要为洁净，把这些带到会幕门口、耶和华面前，交给祭司。
{Lev 14:24} And the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.
{Lev 14:24} 祭司要把赎愆祭的羊羔和那一罗革油一同作摇祭，在耶和华面前摇一摇。
{Lev 14:25} And he shall kill the lamb of the guilt offering. And the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
{Lev 14:25} 要宰了赎愆祭的羊羔，取些赎愆祭牲的血，抹在那求洁净人的右耳垂上和右手的大拇指上，并右脚的大拇指上。
{Lev 14:26} And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand,

{Lev 14:28} 又把手里的油抹些在那求洁净人的右耳垂上和右手的大拇指上，并右脚的大拇指上，就是抹赎愆祭之血的原处。
{Lev 14:29} And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD.

{Lev 14:31} 就是他所能办的，一只为赎罪祭，一只为燔祭，与素祭一同献上；祭司要在耶和华面前为他赎罪。
{Lev 14:32} This is the law for him in whom is a case of leprous disease, who cannot afford the offerings for his cleansing."
{Lev 14:32} 这是那有大麻疯灾病的人、不能将关乎得洁净之物预备够数的条例。”
{Lev 14:33} The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
{Lev 14:33} 耶和华晓谕摩西、亚伦说：
{Lev 14:34} "When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put a case of leprous disease in a house in the land of your possession,
{Lev 14:34} “你们到了我赐给你们为业的迦南地，我若使你们所得为业之地的房屋中有大麻疯的灾病，
{Lev 14:35} then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, 'There seems to me to be some case of disease in my house.'
{Lev 14:35} 房主就要去告诉祭司说：‘据我看，房屋中似乎有灾病。’
{Lev 14:36} Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes to examine the disease, lest all that is in the house be declared unclean. And afterward the priest shall go in to see the house.
{Lev 14:36} 祭司还没有进去察看灾病以前，就要吩咐人把房子腾空，免得房子里所有的都成了不洁净；然后祭司要进去察看房子。
{Lev 14:37} And he shall examine the disease. And if the disease is in the walls of the house with greenish or reddish spots, and if it appears to be deeper than the surface,
{Lev 14:37} 他要察看那灾病，灾病若在房子的墙上有发绿或发红的凹斑纹，现象洼于墙，
{Lev 14:38} then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house and shut up the house seven days.
{Lev 14:38} 祭司就要出到房门外，把房子封锁七天。
{Lev 14:39} And the priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the disease has spread in the walls of the house,
{Lev 14:39} 第七天，祭司要再去察看，灾病若在房子的墙上发散，
{Lev 14:40} then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the disease and throw them into an unclean place outside the city.
{Lev 14:40} 就要吩咐人把那有灾病的石头挖出来，扔在城外不洁净之处；
{Lev 14:41} And he shall have the inside of the house scraped all around, and the plaster that they scrape off they shall pour out in an unclean place outside the city.
{Lev 14:41} 也要叫人刮房内的四围，所刮掉的灰泥要倒在城外不洁净之处；
{Lev 14:42} Then they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other plaster and plaster the house.
{Lev 14:42} 又要用别的石头代替那挖出来的石头，要另用灰泥墁房子。
{Lev 14:43} "If the disease breaks out again in the house, after he has taken out the stones and scraped the house and plastered it,
{Lev 14:43} “他挖出石头，刮了房子，墁了以后，灾病若在房子里又发现，
{Lev 14:44} then the priest shall go and look. And if the disease has spread in the house, it is a persistent leprous disease in the house; it is unclean.
{Lev 14:44} 祭司就要进去察看，灾病若在房子里发散，这就是房内蚕食的大麻疯，是不洁净。
{Lev 14:45} And he shall break down the house, its stones and timber and all the plaster of the house, and he shall carry them out of the city to an unclean place.
{Lev 14:45} 他就要拆毁房子，把石头、木头、灰泥都搬到城外不洁净之处。
{Lev 14:46} Moreover, whoever enters the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening,
{Lev 14:46} 在房子封锁的时候，进去的人必不洁净到晚上；
{Lev 14:47} and whoever sleeps in the house shall wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
{Lev 14:47} 在房子里躺着的必洗衣服；在房子里吃饭的也必洗衣服。
{Lev 14:48} "But if the priest comes and looks, and if the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, for the disease is healed.
{Lev 14:48} “房子墁了以后，祭司若进去察看，见灾病在房内没有发散，就要定房子为洁净，因为灾病已经消除。
{Lev 14:49} And for the cleansing of the house he shall take two small birds, with cedarwood and scarlet yarn and hyssop,
{Lev 14:49} 要为洁净房子取两只鸟和香柏木、朱红色线并牛膝草，
{Lev 14:50} and shall kill one of the birds in an earthenware vessel over fresh water
{Lev 14:50} 用瓦器盛活水，把一只鸟宰在上面，
{Lev 14:51} and shall take the cedarwood and the hyssop and the scarlet yarn, along with the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the fresh water and sprinkle the house seven times.
{Lev 14:51} 把香柏木、牛膝草、朱红色线，并那活鸟，都蘸在被宰的鸟血中与活水中，用以洒房子七次。
{Lev 14:52} Thus he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the fresh water and with the live bird and with the cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet yarn.
{Lev 14:52} 要用鸟血、活水、活鸟、香柏木、牛膝草，并朱红色线，洁净那房子。
{Lev 14:53} And he shall let the live bird go out of the city into the open country. So he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean."
{Lev 14:53} 但要把活鸟放在城外田野里。这样洁净房子（原文作为房子赎罪），房子就洁净了。”
{Lev 14:54} This is the law for any case of leprous disease: for an itch,
{Lev 14:54} 这是为各类大麻疯的灾病和头疥，
{Lev 14:55} for leprous disease in a garment or in a house,
{Lev 14:55} 并衣服与房子的大麻疯，
{Lev 14:56} and for a swelling or an eruption or a spot,
{Lev 14:56} 以及疖子、癣、火斑所立的条例，
{Lev 14:57} to show when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law for leprous disease.
{Lev 14:57} 指明何时为洁净，何时为不洁净。这是大麻疯的条例。

{Lev 20:23} And you shall not walk in the customs of the nation that I am driving out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I detested them.
{Lev 20:23} 我在你们面前所逐出的国民，你们不可随从他们的风俗；因为他们行了这一切的事，所以我厌恶他们。
{Lev 20:24} But I have said to you, 'You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey.' I am the LORD your God, who has separated you from the peoples.

{Lev 21:1}  耶和华对摩西说：“你告诉亚伦子孙作祭司的说：祭司不可为民中的死人沾染自己，
{Lev 21:2}  except for his closest relatives, his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, his brother,
{Lev 21:2}  除非为他骨肉之亲的父母、儿女、弟兄，
{Lev 21:3}  or his virgin sister (who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may make himself unclean).
{Lev 21:3}  和未曾出嫁、作处女的姊妹，才可以沾染自己。
{Lev 21:4}  He shall not make himself unclean as a husband among his people and so profane himself.
{Lev 21:4}  祭司既在民中为首，就不可从俗沾染自己。
{Lev 21:5}  They shall not make bald patches on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts on their body.
{Lev 21:5}  不可使头光秃；不可剃除胡须的周围，也不可用刀划身。
{Lev 21:6}  They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God. For they offer the LORD's food offerings, the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
{Lev 21:6}  要归神为圣，不可亵渎神的名；因为耶和华的火祭，就是神的食物，是他们献的，所以他们要成为圣。
{Lev 21:7}  They shall not marry a prostitute or a woman who has been defiled, neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband, for the priest is holy to his God.
{Lev 21:7}  不可娶妓女或被污的女人为妻，也不可娶被休的妇人为妻，因为祭司是归神为圣。
{Lev 21:8}  You shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I, the LORD, who sanctify you, am holy.

{Lev 21:12} 不可出圣所，也不可亵渎神的圣所，因为神膏油的冠冕在他头上。我是耶和华。
{Lev 21:13} And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
{Lev 21:13} 他要娶处女为妻。
{Lev 21:14} A widow, or a divorced woman, or a woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute, these he shall not marry. But he shall take as his wife a virgin of his own people,
{Lev 21:14} 寡妇或是被休的妇人，或是被污为妓的女人，都不可娶；只可娶本民中的处女为妻。
{Lev 21:15} that he may not profane his offspring among his people, for I am the LORD who sanctifies him."
{Lev 21:15} 不可在民中辱没他的儿女，因为我是叫他成圣的耶和华。”
{Lev 21:16} And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 21:16} 耶和华对摩西说：
{Lev 21:17} "Speak to Aaron, saying, None of your offspring throughout their generations who has a blemish may approach to offer the bread of his God.
{Lev 21:17} “你告诉亚伦说：你世世代代的后裔，凡有残疾的，都不可近前来献他神的食物。
{Lev 21:18} For no one who has a blemish shall draw near, a man blind or lame, or one who has a mutilated face or a limb too long,
{Lev 21:18} 因为凡有残疾的，无论是瞎眼的、瘸腿的、塌鼻子的、肢体有余的、
{Lev 21:19} or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand,
{Lev 21:19} 折脚折手的、
{Lev 21:20} or a hunchback or a dwarf or a man with a defect in his sight or an itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles.
{Lev 21:20} 驼背的、矮矬的、眼睛有毛病的、长癣的、长疥的，或是损坏肾子的，都不可近前来。
{Lev 21:21} No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer the LORD's food offerings; since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
{Lev 21:21} 祭司亚伦的后裔，凡有残疾的，都不可近前来，将火祭献给耶和华。他有残疾，不可近前来献神的食物。
{Lev 21:22} He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy things,
{Lev 21:22} 神的食物，无论是圣的，至圣的，他都可以吃。
{Lev 21:23} but he shall not go through the veil or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not profane my sanctuaries, for I am the LORD who sanctifies them."
{Lev 21:23} 但不可进到幔子前，也不可就近坛前；因为他有残疾，免得亵渎我的圣所。我是叫他成圣的耶和华。”
{Lev 21:24} So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the people of Israel.
{Lev 21:24} 于是，摩西晓谕亚伦和亚伦的子孙，并以色列众人。
{Lev 22:1}  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 22:1}  耶和华对摩西说：
{Lev 22:2}  "Speak to Aaron and his sons so that they abstain from the holy things of the people of Israel, which they dedicate to me, so that they do not profane my holy name: I am the LORD.
{Lev 22:2}  “你吩咐亚伦和他子孙说：要远离以色列人所分别为圣、归给我的圣物，免得亵渎我的圣名。我是耶和华。
{Lev 22:3}  Say to them, 'If any one of all your offspring throughout your generations approaches the holy things that the people of Israel dedicate to the LORD, while he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
{Lev 22:3}  你要对他们说：你们世世代代的后裔，凡身上有污秽、亲近以色列人所分别为圣、归耶和华圣物的，那人必在我面前剪除。我是耶和华。
{Lev 22:4}  None of the offspring of Aaron who has a leprous disease or a discharge may eat of the holy things until he is clean. Whoever touches anything that is unclean through contact with the dead or a man who has had an emission of semen,
{Lev 22:4}  亚伦的后裔，凡长大麻疯的，或是有漏症的，不可吃圣物，直等他洁净了。无论谁摸那因死尸不洁净的物（或作：人），或是遗精的人，
{Lev 22:5}  and whoever touches a swarming thing by which he may be made unclean or a person from whom he may take uncleanness, whatever his uncleanness may be--
{Lev 22:5}  或是摸什么使他不洁净的爬物，或是摸那使他不洁净的人（不拘那人有什么不洁净），
{Lev 22:6}  the person who touches such a thing shall be unclean until the evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has bathed his body in water.
{Lev 22:6}  摸了这些人、物的，必不洁净到晚上；若不用水洗身，就不可吃圣物。
{Lev 22:7}  When the sun goes down he shall be clean, and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because they are his food.
{Lev 22:7}  日落的时候，他就洁净了，然后可以吃圣物，因为这是他的食物。
{Lev 22:8}  He shall not eat what dies of itself or is torn by beasts, and so make himself unclean by it: I am the LORD.'
{Lev 22:8}  自死的或是被野兽撕裂的，他不可吃，因此污秽自己。我是耶和华。
{Lev 22:9}  They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby when they profane it: I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
{Lev 22:9}  所以他们要守我所吩咐的，免得轻忽了，因此担罪而死。我是叫他们成圣的耶和华。
{Lev 22:10} "A lay person shall not eat of a holy thing; no foreign guest of the priest or hired worker shall eat of a holy thing,
{Lev 22:10} “凡外人不可吃圣物；寄居在祭司家的，或是雇工人，都不可吃圣物；
{Lev 22:11} but if a priest buys a slave as his property for money, the slave may eat of it, and anyone born in his house may eat of his food.
{Lev 22:11} 倘若祭司买人，是他的钱买的，那人就可以吃圣物；生在他家的人也可以吃。
{Lev 22:12} If a priest's daughter marries a layman, she shall not eat of the contribution of the holy things.
{Lev 22:12} 祭司的女儿若嫁外人，就不可吃举祭的圣物。
{Lev 22:13} But if a priest's daughter is widowed or divorced and has no child and returns to her father's house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food; yet no lay person shall eat of it.
{Lev 22:13} 但祭司的女儿若是寡妇，或是被休的，没有孩子，又归回父家，与他青年一样，就可以吃他父亲的食物；只是外人不可吃。
{Lev 22:14} And if anyone eats of a holy thing unintentionally, he shall add the fifth of its value to it and give the holy thing to the priest.
{Lev 22:14} 若有人误吃了圣物，要照圣物的原数加上五分之一交给祭司。
{Lev 22:15} They shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, which they contribute to the LORD,
{Lev 22:15} 祭司不可亵渎以色列人所献给耶和华的圣物，
{Lev 22:16} and so cause them to bear iniquity and guilt, by eating their holy things: for I am the LORD who sanctifies them."
{Lev 22:16} 免得他们在吃圣物上自取罪孽，因为我是叫他们成圣的耶和华。”
{Lev 22:17} And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 22:17} 耶和华对摩西说：
{Lev 22:18} "Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel and say to them, When any one of the house of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel presents a burnt offering as his offering, for any of their vows or freewill offerings that they offer to the LORD,
{Lev 22:18} “你晓谕亚伦和他子孙，并以色列众人说：以色列家中的人，或在以色列中寄居的，凡献供物，无论是所许的愿，是甘心献的，就是献给耶和华作燔祭的，
{Lev 22:19} if it is to be accepted for you it shall be a male without blemish, of the bulls or the sheep or the goats.
{Lev 22:19} 要将没有残疾的公牛，或是绵羊，或是山羊献上，如此方蒙悦纳。
{Lev 22:20} You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable for you.
{Lev 22:20} 凡有残疾的，你们不可献上，因为这不蒙悦纳。
{Lev 22:21} And when anyone offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock, to be accepted it must be perfect; there shall be no blemish in it.
{Lev 22:21} 凡从牛群或是羊群中，将平安祭献给耶和华，为要还特许的愿，或是作甘心献的，所献的必纯全无残疾的才蒙悦纳。
{Lev 22:22} Animals blind or disabled or mutilated or having a discharge or an itch or scabs you shall not offer to the LORD or give them to the LORD as a food offering on the altar.
{Lev 22:22} 瞎眼的、折伤的、残废的、有瘤子的、长癣的、长疥的都不可献给耶和华，也不可在坛上作为火祭献给耶和华。
{Lev 22:23} You may present a bull or a lamb that has a part too long or too short for a freewill offering, but for a vow offering it cannot be accepted.
{Lev 22:23} 无论是公牛是绵羊羔，若肢体有余的，或是缺少的，只可作甘心祭献上；用以还愿，却不蒙悦纳。
{Lev 22:24} Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut you shall not offer to the LORD; you shall not do it within your land,
{Lev 22:24} 肾子损伤的，或是压碎的，或是破裂的，或是骟了的，不可献给耶和华，在你们的地上也不可这样行。
{Lev 22:25} neither shall you offer as the bread of your God any such animals gotten from a foreigner. Since there is a blemish in them, because of their mutilation, they will not be accepted for you."
{Lev 22:25} 这类的物，你们从外人的手，一样也不可接受作你们神的食物献上；因为这些都有损坏，有残疾，不蒙悦纳。”
{Lev 22:26} And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 22:26} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 22:27} "When an ox or sheep or goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as a food offering to the LORD.
{Lev 22:27} “才生的公牛，或是绵羊或是山羊，七天当跟着母；从第八天以后，可以当供物蒙悦纳，作为耶和华的火祭。
{Lev 22:28} But you shall not kill an ox or a sheep and her young in one day.
{Lev 22:28} 无论是母牛是母羊，不可同日宰母和子。
{Lev 22:29} And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
{Lev 22:29} 你们献感谢祭给耶和华，要献得可蒙悦纳。
{Lev 22:30} It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until morning: I am the LORD.
{Lev 22:30} 要当天吃，一点不可留到早晨。我是耶和华。
{Lev 22:31} "So you shall keep my commandments and do them: I am the LORD.
{Lev 22:31} “你们要谨守遵行我的诫命。我是耶和华。
{Lev 22:32} And you shall not profane my holy name, that I may be sanctified among the people of Israel. I am the LORD who sanctifies you,
{Lev 22:32} 你们不可亵渎我的圣名；我在以色列人中，却要被尊为圣。我是叫你们成圣的耶和华，
{Lev 22:33} who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the LORD."
{Lev 22:33} 把你们从埃及地领出来，作你们的神。我是耶和华。”
{Lev 23:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 23:1}  耶和华对摩西说：
{Lev 23:2}  "Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, These are the appointed feasts of the LORD that you shall proclaim as holy convocations; they are my appointed feasts.
{Lev 23:2}  “你晓谕以色列人说：耶和华的节期，你们要宣告为圣会的节期。
{Lev 23:3}  "Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work. It is a Sabbath to the LORD in all your dwelling places.
{Lev 23:3}  六日要做工，第七日是圣安息日，当有圣会；你们什么工都不可做。这是在你们一切的住处向耶和华守的安息日。
{Lev 23:4}  "These are the appointed feasts of the LORD, the holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at the time appointed for them.
{Lev 23:4}  耶和华的节期，就是你们到了日期要宣告为圣会的，乃是这些。”
{Lev 23:5}  In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight, is the LORD's Passover.
{Lev 23:5}  “正月十四日，黄昏的时候，是耶和华的逾越节。
{Lev 23:6}  And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
{Lev 23:6}  这月十五日是向耶和华守的无酵节；你们要吃无酵饼七日。
{Lev 23:7}  On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.
{Lev 23:7}  第一日当有圣会，什么劳碌的工都不可做；
{Lev 23:8}  But you shall present a food offering to the LORD for seven days. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work."
{Lev 23:8}  要将火祭献给耶和华七日。第七日是圣会，什么劳碌的工都不可做。”
{Lev 23:9}  And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 23:9}  耶和华对摩西说：
{Lev 23:10} "Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land that I give you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest,
{Lev 23:10} “你晓谕以色列人说：你们到了我赐给你们的地，收割庄稼的时候，要将初熟的庄稼一捆带给祭司。
{Lev 23:11} and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, so that you may be accepted. On the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
{Lev 23:11} 他要把这一捆在耶和华面前摇一摇，使你们得蒙悦纳。祭司要在安息日的次日把这捆摇一摇。
{Lev 23:12} And on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD.
{Lev 23:12} 摇这捆的日子，你们要把一岁、没有残疾的公绵羊羔献给耶和华为燔祭。
{Lev 23:13} And the grain offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, a food offering to the LORD with a pleasing aroma, and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, a fourth of a hin.
{Lev 23:13} 同献的素祭，就是调油的细面伊法十分之二，作为馨香的火祭，献给耶和华。同献的奠祭，要酒一欣四分之一。
{Lev 23:14} And you shall eat neither bread nor grain parched or fresh until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
{Lev 23:14} 无论是饼，是烘的子粒，是新穗子，你们都不可吃，直等到把你们献给神的供物带来的那一天才可以吃。这在你们一切的住处作为世世代代永远的定例。”
{Lev 23:15} "You shall count seven full weeks from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering.
{Lev 23:15} “你们要从安息日的次日，献禾捆为摇祭的那日算起，要满了七个安息日。
{Lev 23:16} You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath. Then you shall present a grain offering of new grain to the LORD.
{Lev 23:16} 到第七个安息日的次日，共计五十天，又要将新素祭献给耶和华。
{Lev 23:17} You shall bring from your dwelling places two loaves of bread to be waved, made of two tenths of an ephah. They shall be of fine flour, and they shall be baked with leaven, as firstfruits to the LORD.
{Lev 23:17} 要从你们的住处取出细面伊法十分之二，加酵，烤成两个摇祭的饼，当作初熟之物献给耶和华。
{Lev 23:18} And you shall present with the bread seven lambs a year old without blemish, and one bull from the herd and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
{Lev 23:18} 又要将一岁、没有残疾的羊羔七只、公牛犊一只、公绵羊两只，和饼一同奉上。这些与同献的素祭和奠祭要作为燔祭献给耶和华，就是作馨香的火祭献给耶和华。
{Lev 23:19} And you shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings.
{Lev 23:19} 你们要献一只公山羊为赎罪祭，两只一岁的公绵羊羔为平安祭。
{Lev 23:20} And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
{Lev 23:20} 祭司要把这些和初熟麦子做的饼一同作摇祭，在耶和华面前摇一摇；这是献与耶和华为圣物归给祭司的。
{Lev 23:21} And you shall make a proclamation on the same day. You shall hold a holy convocation. You shall not do any ordinary work. It is a statute forever in all your dwelling places throughout your generations.
{Lev 23:21} 当这日，你们要宣告圣会；什么劳碌的工都不可做。这在你们一切的住处作为世世代代永远的定例。
{Lev 23:22} "And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, nor shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the LORD your God."
{Lev 23:22} “在你们的地收割庄稼，不可割尽田角，也不可拾取所遗落的；要留给穷人和寄居的。我是耶和华你们的神。”
{Lev 23:23} And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 23:23} 耶和华对摩西说：
{Lev 23:24} "Speak to the people of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe a day of solemn rest, a memorial proclaimed with blast of trumpets, a holy convocation.
{Lev 23:24} “你晓谕以色列人说：七月初一，你们要守为圣安息日，要吹角作纪念，当有圣会。
{Lev 23:25} You shall not do any ordinary work, and you shall present a food offering to the LORD."
{Lev 23:25} 什么劳碌的工都不可做；要将火祭献给耶和华。”
{Lev 23:26} And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 23:26} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 23:27} "Now on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It shall be for you a time of holy convocation, and you shall afflict yourselves and present a food offering to the LORD.
{Lev 23:27} “七月初十是赎罪日；你们要守为圣会，并要刻苦己心，也要将火祭献给耶和华。
{Lev 23:28} And you shall not do any work on that very day, for it is a Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God.
{Lev 23:28} 当这日，什么工都不可做；因为是赎罪日，要在耶和华你们的神面前赎罪。
{Lev 23:29} For whoever is not afflicted on that very day shall be cut off from his people.
{Lev 23:29} 当这日，凡不刻苦己心的，必从民中剪除。
{Lev 23:30} And whoever does any work on that very day, that person I will destroy from among his people.
{Lev 23:30} 凡这日做什么工的，我必将他从民中除灭。
{Lev 23:31} You shall not do any work. It is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.
{Lev 23:31} 你们什么工都不可做。这在你们一切的住处作为世世代代永远的定例。
{Lev 23:32} It shall be to you a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict yourselves. On the ninth day of the month beginning at evening, from evening to evening shall you keep your Sabbath."
{Lev 23:32} 你们要守这日为圣安息日，并要刻苦己心。从这月初九日晚上到次日晚上，要守为安息日。”
{Lev 23:33} And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 23:33} 耶和华对摩西说：
{Lev 23:34} "Speak to the people of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month and for seven days is the Feast of Booths to the LORD.
{Lev 23:34} “你晓谕以色列人说：这七月十五日是住棚节，要在耶和华面前守这节七日。
{Lev 23:35} On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.
{Lev 23:35} 第一日当有圣会，什么劳碌的工都不可做。
{Lev 23:36} For seven days you shall present food offerings to the LORD. On the eighth day you shall hold a holy convocation and present a food offering to the LORD. It is a solemn assembly; you shall not do any ordinary work.
{Lev 23:36} 七日内要将火祭献给耶和华。第八日当守圣会，要将火祭献给耶和华。这是严肃会，什么劳碌的工都不可做。
{Lev 23:37} "These are the appointed feasts of the LORD, which you shall proclaim as times of holy convocation, for presenting to the LORD food offerings, burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its proper day,
{Lev 23:37} “这是耶和华的节期，就是你们要宣告为圣会的节期；要将火祭、燔祭、素祭、祭物，并奠祭，各归各日，献给耶和华。
{Lev 23:38} besides the LORD's Sabbaths and besides your gifts and besides all your vow offerings and besides all your freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD.
{Lev 23:38} 这是在耶和华的安息日以外，又在你们的供物和所许的愿，并甘心献给耶和华的以外。
{Lev 23:39} "On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the LORD seven days. On the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
{Lev 23:39} “你们收藏了地的出产，就从七月十五日起，要守耶和华的节七日。第一日为圣安息；第八日也为圣安息。
{Lev 23:40} And you shall take on the first day the fruit of splendid trees, branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
{Lev 23:40} 第一日要拿美好树上的果子和棕树上的枝子，与茂密树的枝条并河旁的柳枝，在耶和华你们的神面前欢乐七日。
{Lev 23:41} You shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It is a statute forever throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
{Lev 23:41} 每年七月间，要向耶和华守这节七日。这为你们世世代代永远的定例。
{Lev 23:42} You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All native Israelites shall dwell in booths,
{Lev 23:42} 你们要住在棚里七日；凡以色列家的人都要住在棚里，
{Lev 23:43} that your generations may know that I made the people of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God."
{Lev 23:43} 好叫你们世世代代知道，我领以色列人出埃及地的时候曾使他们住在棚里。我是耶和华你们的神。”
{Lev 23:44} Thus Moses declared to the people of Israel the appointed feasts of the LORD.
{Lev 23:44} 于是，摩西将耶和华的节期传给以色列人。
{Lev 24:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 24:1}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 24:2}  "Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp, that a light may be kept burning regularly.
{Lev 24:2}  “要吩咐以色列人，把那为点灯捣成的清橄榄油拿来给你，使灯常常点着。
{Lev 24:3}  Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall arrange it from evening to morning before the LORD regularly. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
{Lev 24:3}  在会幕中法柜的幔子外，亚伦从晚上到早晨必在耶和华面前经理这灯。这要作你们世世代代永远的定例。
{Lev 24:4}  He shall arrange the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold before the LORD regularly.
{Lev 24:4}  他要在耶和华面前常收拾精金灯台上的灯。”
{Lev 24:5}  "You shall take fine flour and bake twelve loaves from it; two tenths of an ephah shall be in each loaf.
{Lev 24:5}  “你要取细面，烤成十二个饼，每饼用面伊法十分之二。
{Lev 24:6}  And you shall set them in two piles, six in a pile, on the table of pure gold before the LORD.
{Lev 24:6}  要把饼摆列两行（或作：摞；下同），每行六个，在耶和华面前精金的桌子上；
{Lev 24:7}  And you shall put pure frankincense on each pile, that it may go with the bread as a memorial portion as a food offering to the LORD.
{Lev 24:7}  又要把净乳香放在每行饼上，作为纪念，就是作为火祭献给耶和华。
{Lev 24:8}  Every Sabbath day Aaron shall arrange it before the LORD regularly; it is from the people of Israel as a covenant forever.
{Lev 24:8}  每安息日要常摆在耶和华面前；这为以色列人作永远的约。
{Lev 24:9}  And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place, since it is for him a most holy portion out of the LORD's food offerings, a perpetual due."
{Lev 24:9}  这饼是要给亚伦和他子孙的；他们要在圣处吃，为永远的定例，因为在献给耶和华的火祭中是至圣的。”
{Lev 24:10} Now an Israelite woman's son, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the people of Israel. And the Israelite woman's son and a man of Israel fought in the camp,
{Lev 24:10} 有一个以色列妇人的儿子，他父亲是埃及人，一日闲游在以色列人中。这以色列妇人的儿子和一个以色列人在营里争斗。
{Lev 24:11} and the Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name, and cursed. Then they brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
{Lev 24:11} 这以色列妇人的儿子亵渎了圣名，并且咒诅，就有人把他送到摩西那里。（他母亲名叫示罗密，是但支派底伯利的女儿。）
{Lev 24:12} And they put him in custody, till the will of the LORD should be clear to them.
{Lev 24:12} 他们把那人收在监里，要得耶和华所指示的话。
{Lev 24:13} Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
{Lev 24:13} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Lev 24:14} "Bring out of the camp the one who cursed, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
{Lev 24:14} “把那咒诅圣名的人带到营外。叫听见的人都放手在他头上；全会众就要用石头打死他。
{Lev 24:15} And speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.
{Lev 24:15} 你要晓谕以色列人说：凡咒诅神的，必担当他的罪。
{Lev 24:16} Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.
{Lev 24:16} 那亵渎耶和华名的，必被治死；全会众总要用石头打死他。不管是寄居的是本地人，他亵渎耶和华名的时候，必被治死。
{Lev 24:17} "Whoever takes a human life shall surely be put to death.
{Lev 24:17} 打死人的，必被治死；
{Lev 24:18} Whoever takes an animal's life shall make it good, life for life.
{Lev 24:18} 打死牲畜的，必赔上牲畜，以命偿命。
{Lev 24:19} If anyone injures his neighbor, as he has done it shall be done to him,
{Lev 24:19} 人若使他邻舍的身体有残疾，他怎样行，也要照样向他行：
{Lev 24:20} fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; whatever injury he has given a person shall be given to him.
{Lev 24:20} 以伤还伤，以眼还眼，以牙还牙。他怎样叫人的身体有残疾，也要照样向他行。
{Lev 24:21} Whoever kills an animal shall make it good, and whoever kills a person shall be put to death.
{Lev 24:21} 打死牲畜的，必赔上牲畜；打死人的，必被治死。
{Lev 24:22} You shall have the same rule for the sojourner and for the native, for I am the LORD your God."
{Lev 24:22} 不管是寄居的是本地人，同归一例。我是耶和华你们的神。”
{Lev 24:23} So Moses spoke to the people of Israel, and they brought out of the camp the one who had cursed and stoned him with stones. Thus the people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Lev 24:23} 于是，摩西晓谕以色列人，他们就把那咒诅圣名的人带到营外，用石头打死。以色列人就照耶和华所吩咐摩西的行了。
{Lev 25:1}  The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,
{Lev 25:1}  耶和华在西乃山对摩西说：
{Lev 25:2}  "Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land that I give you, the land shall keep a Sabbath to the LORD.
{Lev 25:2}  “你晓谕以色列人说：你们到了我所赐你们那地的时候，地就要向耶和华守安息。
{Lev 25:3}  For six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its fruits,
{Lev 25:3}  六年要耕种田地，也要修理葡萄园，收藏地的出产。
{Lev 25:4}  but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to the LORD. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
{Lev 25:4}  第七年，地要守圣安息，就是向耶和华守的安息，不可耕种田地，也不可修理葡萄园。
{Lev 25:5}  You shall not reap what grows of itself in your harvest, or gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
{Lev 25:5}  遗落自长的庄稼不可收割；没有修理的葡萄树也不可摘取葡萄。这年，地要守圣安息。
{Lev 25:6}  The Sabbath of the land shall provide food for you, for yourself and for your male and female slaves and for your hired worker and the sojourner who lives with you,
{Lev 25:6}  地在安息年所出的，要给你和你的仆人、婢女、雇工人，并寄居的外人当食物。
{Lev 25:7}  and for your cattle and for the wild animals that are in your land: all its yield shall be for food.
{Lev 25:7}  这年的土产也要给你的牲畜和你地上的走兽当食物。”
{Lev 25:8}  "You shall count seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you forty-nine years.
{Lev 25:8}  “你要计算七个安息年，就是七七年。这便为你成了七个安息年，共是四十九年。
{Lev 25:9}  Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land.
{Lev 25:9}  当年七月初十日，你要大发角声；这日就是赎罪日，要在遍地发出角声。
{Lev 25:10} And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his clan.
{Lev 25:10} 第五十年，你们要当作圣年，在遍地给一切的居民宣告自由。这年必为你们的禧年，各人要归自己的产业，各归本家。
{Lev 25:11} That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of itself nor gather the grapes from the undressed vines.
{Lev 25:11} 第五十年要作为你们的禧年。这年不可耕种；地中自长的，不可收割；没有修理的葡萄树也不可摘取葡萄。
{Lev 25:12} For it is a jubilee. It shall be holy to you. You may eat the produce of the field.
{Lev 25:12} 因为这是禧年，你们要当作圣年，吃地中自出的土产。
{Lev 25:13} "In this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his property.
{Lev 25:13} “这禧年，你们各人要归自己的地业。
{Lev 25:14} And if you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another.
{Lev 25:14} 你若卖什么给邻舍，或是从邻舍的手中买什么，彼此不可亏负。
{Lev 25:15} You shall pay your neighbor according to the number of years after the jubilee, and he shall sell to you according to the number of years for crops.
{Lev 25:15} 你要按禧年以后的年数向邻舍买；他也要按年数的收成卖给你。
{Lev 25:16} If the years are many, you shall increase the price, and if the years are few, you shall reduce the price, for it is the number of the crops that he is selling to you.
{Lev 25:16} 年岁若多，要照数加添价值；年岁若少，要照数减去价值，因为他照收成的数目卖给你。
{Lev 25:17} You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God, for I am the LORD your God.
{Lev 25:17} 你们彼此不可亏负，只要敬畏你们的神，因为我是耶和华你们的神。”
{Lev 25:18} "Therefore you shall do my statutes and keep my rules and perform them, and then you will dwell in the land securely.
{Lev 25:18} “我的律例，你们要遵行，我的典章，你们要谨守，就可以在那地上安然居住。
{Lev 25:19} The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and dwell in it securely.
{Lev 25:19} 地必出土产，你们就要吃饱，在那地上安然居住。
{Lev 25:20} And if you say, 'What shall we eat in the seventh year, if we may not sow or gather in our crop?'
{Lev 25:20} 你们若说：‘这第七年我们不耕种，也不收藏土产，吃什么呢？’
{Lev 25:21} I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, so that it will produce a crop sufficient for three years.
{Lev 25:21} 我必在第六年将我所命的福赐给你们，地便生三年的土产。
{Lev 25:22} When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating some of the old crop; you shall eat the old until the ninth year, when its crop arrives.
{Lev 25:22} 第八年，你们要耕种，也要吃陈粮，等到第九年出产收来的时候，你们还吃陈粮。”
{Lev 25:23} "The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me.
{Lev 25:23} “地不可永卖，因为地是我的；你们在我面前是客旅，是寄居的。
{Lev 25:24} And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.
{Lev 25:24} 在你们所得为业的全地，也要准人将地赎回。
{Lev 25:25} "If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.
{Lev 25:25} 你的弟兄（弟兄是指本国人说；下同）若渐渐穷乏，卖了几分地业，他至近的亲属就要来把弟兄所卖的赎回。
{Lev 25:26} If a man has no one to redeem it and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it,
{Lev 25:26} 若没有能给他赎回的，他自己渐渐富足，能够赎回，
{Lev 25:27} let him calculate the years since he sold it and pay back the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and then return to his property.
{Lev 25:27} 就要算出卖地的年数，把余剩年数的价值还那买主，自己便归回自己的地业。
{Lev 25:28} But if he does not have sufficient means to recover it, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property.
{Lev 25:28} 倘若不能为自己得回所卖的，仍要存在买主的手里直到禧年；到了禧年，地业要出买主的手，自己便归回自己的地业。
{Lev 25:29} "If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, he may redeem it within a year of its sale. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.
{Lev 25:29} “人若卖城内的住宅，卖了以后，一年之内可以赎回；在一整年，必有赎回的权柄。
{Lev 25:30} If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house in the walled city shall belong in perpetuity to the buyer, throughout his generations; it shall not be released in the jubilee.
{Lev 25:30} 若在一整年之内不赎回，这城内的房屋就定准永归买主，世世代代为业；在禧年也不得出买主的手。
{Lev 25:31} But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them shall be classified with the fields of the land. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee.
{Lev 25:31} 但房屋在无城墙的村庄里，要看如乡下的田地一样，可以赎回；到了禧年，都要出买主的手。
{Lev 25:32} As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem at any time the houses in the cities they possess.
{Lev 25:32} 然而利未人所得为业的城邑，其中的房屋，利未人可以随时赎回。
{Lev 25:33} And if one of the Levites exercises his right of redemption, then the house that was sold in a city they possess shall be released in the jubilee. For the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the people of Israel.
{Lev 25:33} 若是一个利未人不将所卖的房屋赎回，是在所得为业的城内，到了禧年就要出买主的手，因为利未人城邑的房屋是他们在以色列人中的产业。
{Lev 25:34} But the fields of pastureland belonging to their cities may not be sold, for that is their possession forever.
{Lev 25:34} 只是他们各城郊野之地不可卖，因为是他们永远的产业。”
{Lev 25:35} "If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you.
{Lev 25:35} “你的弟兄在你那里若渐渐贫穷，手中缺乏，你就要帮补他，使他与你同住，像外人和寄居的一样。

{Lev 25:39} “你的弟兄若在你那里渐渐穷乏，将自己卖给你，不可叫他像奴仆服事你。
{Lev 25:40} he shall be with you as a hired worker and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee.
{Lev 25:40} 他要在你那里像雇工人和寄居的一样，要服事你直到禧年。
{Lev 25:41} Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his own clan and return to the possession of his fathers.
{Lev 25:41} 到了禧年，他和他儿女要离开你，一同出去归回本家，到他祖宗的地业那里去。
{Lev 25:42} For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves.
{Lev 25:42} 因为他们是我的仆人，是我从埃及地领出来的，不可卖为奴仆。

{Lev 25:44} As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you.
{Lev 25:44} 至于你的奴仆、婢女，可以从你四围的国中买。
{Lev 25:45} You may also buy from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their clans that are with you, who have been born in your land, and they may be your property.
{Lev 25:45} 并且那寄居在你们中间的外人和他们的家属，在你们地上所生的，你们也可以从其中买人；他们要作你们的产业。
{Lev 25:46} You may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever. You may make slaves of them, but over your brothers the people of Israel you shall not rule, one over another ruthlessly.
{Lev 25:46} 你们要将他们遗留给你们的子孙为产业，要永远从他们中间拣出奴仆；只是你们的弟兄以色列人，你们不可严严地辖管。
{Lev 25:47} "If a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner with you or to a member of the stranger's clan,
{Lev 25:47} “住在你那里的外人，或是寄居的，若渐渐富足，你的弟兄却渐渐穷乏，将自己卖给那外人，或是寄居的，或是外人的宗族，

{Lev 25:50} He shall calculate with his buyer from the year when he sold himself to him until the year of jubilee, and the price of his sale shall vary with the number of years. The time he was with his owner shall be rated as the time of a hired worker.
{Lev 25:50} 他要和买主计算，从卖自己的那年起，算到禧年；所卖的价值照着年数多少，好像工人每年的工价。
{Lev 25:51} If there are still many years left, he shall pay proportionately for his redemption some of his sale price.
{Lev 25:51} 若缺少的年数多，就要按着年数从买价中偿还他的赎价。
{Lev 25:52} If there remain but a few years until the year of jubilee, he shall calculate and pay for his redemption in proportion to his years of service.
{Lev 25:52} 若到禧年只缺少几年，就要按着年数和买主计算，偿还他的赎价。
