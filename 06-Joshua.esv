{Jos 1:1}   After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' assistant,
{Jos 1:1}   耶和华的仆人摩西死了以后，耶和华晓谕摩西的帮手，嫩的儿子约书亚，说：
{Jos 1:2}   "Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the people of Israel.
{Jos 1:2}   “我的仆人摩西死了。现在你要起来，和众百姓过这约但河，往我所要赐给以色列人的地去。
{Jos 1:3}   Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, just as I promised to Moses.
{Jos 1:3}   凡你们脚掌所踏之地，我都照着我所应许摩西的话赐给你们了。
{Jos 1:4}   From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory.
{Jos 1:4}   从旷野和这利巴嫩，直到伯拉大河，赫人的全地，又到大海日落之处，都要作你们的境界。
{Jos 1:5}   No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you or forsake you.
{Jos 1:5}   你平生的日子，必无一人能在你面前站立得住。我怎样与摩西同在，也必照样与你同在；我必不撇下你，也不丢弃你。
{Jos 1:6}   Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.
{Jos 1:6}   你当刚强壮胆！因为你必使这百姓承受那地为业，就是我向他们列祖起誓应许赐给他们的地。
{Jos 1:7}   Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.
{Jos 1:7}   只要刚强，大大壮胆，谨守遵行我仆人摩西所吩咐你的一切律法，不可偏离左右，使你无论往那里去，都可以顺利。
{Jos 1:8}   This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.
{Jos 1:8}   这律法书不可离开你的口，总要昼夜思想，好使你谨守遵行这书上所写的一切话。如此，你的道路就可以亨通，凡事顺利。
{Jos 1:9}   Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."
{Jos 1:9}   我岂没有吩咐你吗？你当刚强壮胆！不要惧怕，也不要惊惶；因为你无论往那里去，耶和华你的神必与你同在。”
{Jos 1:10}  And Joshua commanded the officers of the people,
{Jos 1:10}  于是，约书亚吩咐百姓的官长说：
{Jos 1:11}  "Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, 'Prepare your provisions, for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.'"
{Jos 1:11}  “你们要走遍营中，吩咐百姓说：‘当预备食物；因为三日之内你们要过这约但河，进去得耶和华你们神赐你们为业之地。’”
{Jos 1:12}  And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,
{Jos 1:12}  约书亚对流便人、迦得人，和玛拿西半支派的人说：
{Jos 1:13}  "Remember the word that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, 'The LORD your God is providing you a place of rest and will give you this land.'
{Jos 1:13}  “你们要追念耶和华的仆人摩西所吩咐你们的话说：‘耶和华你们的神使你们得享平安，也必将这地赐给你们。’
{Jos 1:14}  Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but all the men of valor among you shall pass over armed before your brothers and shall help them,
{Jos 1:14}  你们的妻子、孩子，和牲畜都可以留在约但河东、摩西所给你们的地；但你们中间一切大能的勇士都要带着兵器在你们的弟兄前面过去，帮助他们，
{Jos 1:15}  until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they also take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and shall possess it, the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise."
{Jos 1:15}  等到耶和华使你们的弟兄像你们一样得享平安，并且得着耶和华你们神所赐他们为业之地，那时才可以回你们所得之地，承受为业，就是耶和华的仆人摩西在约但河东、向日出之地所给你们的。”
{Jos 1:16}  And they answered Joshua, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
{Jos 1:16}  他们回答约书亚说：“你所吩咐我们行的，我们都必行；你所差遣我们去的，我们都必去。
{Jos 1:17}  Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you, as he was with Moses!
{Jos 1:17}  我们从前在一切事上怎样听从摩西，现在也必照样听从你；惟愿耶和华你的神与你同在，像与摩西同在一样。
{Jos 1:18}  Whoever rebels against your commandment and disobeys your words, whatever you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous."
{Jos 1:18}  无论什么人违背你的命令，不听从你所吩咐他的一切话，就必治死他。你只要刚强壮胆！”
{Jos 2:1}   And Joshua the son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, especially Jericho." And they went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab and lodged there.
{Jos 2:1}   当下，嫩的儿子约书亚从什亭暗暗打发两个人作探子，吩咐说：“你们去窥探那地和耶利哥。”于是二人去了，来到一个妓女名叫喇合的家里，就在那里躺卧。
{Jos 2:2}   And it was told to the king of Jericho, "Behold, men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land."
{Jos 2:2}   有人告诉耶利哥王说：“今夜有以色列人来到这里窥探此地。”
{Jos 2:3}   Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land."
{Jos 2:3}   耶利哥王打发人去见喇合说：“那来到你这里、进了你家的人要交出来，因为他们来窥探全地。”
{Jos 2:4}   But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. And she said, "True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.
{Jos 2:4}   女人将二人隐藏，就回答说：“那人果然到我这里来；他们是那里来的我却不知道。
{Jos 2:5}   And when the gate was about to be closed at dark, the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them."
{Jos 2:5}   天黑、要关城门的时候，他们出去了，往那里去我却不知道。你们快快地去追赶，就必追上。”
{Jos 2:6}   But she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax that she had laid in order on the roof.
{Jos 2:6}   （先是女人领二人上了房顶，将他们藏在那里所摆的麻秸中。）
{Jos 2:7}   So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords. And the gate was shut as soon as the pursuers had gone out.
{Jos 2:7}   那些人就往约但河的渡口追赶他们去了。追赶他们的人一出去，城门就关了。
{Jos 2:8}   Before the men lay down, she came up to them on the roof
{Jos 2:8}   二人还没有躺卧，女人就上房顶，到他们那里，
{Jos 2:9}   and said to the men, "I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
{Jos 2:9}   对他们说：“我知道耶和华已经把这地赐给你们，并且因你们的缘故我们都惊慌了。这地的一切居民在你们面前心都消化了；
{Jos 2:10}  For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you devoted to destruction.
{Jos 2:10}  因为我们听见你们出埃及的时候，耶和华怎样在你们前面使红海的水干了，并且你们怎样待约但河东的两个亚摩利王西宏和噩，将他们尽行毁灭。
{Jos 2:11}  And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no spirit left in any man because of you, for the LORD your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.
{Jos 2:11}  我们一听见这些事，心就消化了。因你们的缘故，并无一人有胆气。耶和华你们的神本是上天下地的神。
{Jos 2:12}  Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that, as I have dealt kindly with you, you also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a sure sign
{Jos 2:12}  现在我既是恩待你们，求你们指着耶和华向我起誓，也要恩待我父家，并给我一个实在的证据，
{Jos 2:13}  that you will save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death."
{Jos 2:13}  要救活我的父母、弟兄、姊妹，和一切属他们的，拯救我们性命不死。”
{Jos 2:14}  And the men said to her, "Our life for yours even to death! If you do not tell this business of ours, then when the LORD gives us the land we will deal kindly and faithfully with you."
{Jos 2:14}  二人对他说：“你若不泄漏我们这件事，我们情愿替你们死。耶和华将这地赐给我们的时候，我们必以慈爱诚实待你。”
{Jos 2:15}  Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall, so that she lived in the wall.
{Jos 2:15}  于是女人用绳子将二人从窗户里缒下去；因他的房子是在城墙边上，他也住在城墙上。
{Jos 2:16}  And she said to them, "Go into the hills, or the pursuers will encounter you, and hide there three days until the pursuers have returned. Then afterward you may go your way."
{Jos 2:16}  他对他们说：“你们且往山上去，恐怕追赶的人碰见你们；要在那里隐藏三天，等追赶的人回来，然后才可以走你们的路。”
{Jos 2:17}  The men said to her, "We will be guiltless with respect to this oath of yours that you have made us swear.
{Jos 2:17}  二人对他说：“你要这样行。不然，你叫我们所起的誓就与我们无干了。
{Jos 2:18}  Behold, when we come into the land, you shall tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you shall gather into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.
{Jos 2:18}  我们来到这地的时候，你要把这条朱红线绳系在缒我们下去的窗户上，并要使你的父母、弟兄，和你父的全家都聚集在你家中。
{Jos 2:19}  Then if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we shall be guiltless. But if a hand is laid on anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head.
{Jos 2:19}  凡出了你家门往街上去的，他的罪（原文作血）必归到自己的头上，与我们无干了。凡在你家里的，若有人下手害他，流他血的罪就归到我们的头上。
{Jos 2:20}  But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless with respect to your oath that you have made us swear."
{Jos 2:20}  你若泄漏我们这件事，你叫我们所起的誓就与我们无干了。
{Jos 2:21}  And she said, "According to your words, so be it." Then she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
{Jos 2:21}  女人说：“照你们的话行吧！”于是打发他们去了，又把朱红线绳系在窗户上。
{Jos 2:22}  They departed and went into the hills and remained there three days until the pursuers returned, and the pursuers searched all along the way and found nothing.
{Jos 2:22}  二人到山上，在那里住了三天，等着追赶的人回去了。追赶的人一路找他们，却找不着。
{Jos 2:23}  Then the two men returned. They came down from the hills and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they told him all that had happened to them.
{Jos 2:23}  二人就下山回来，过了河，到嫩的儿子约书亚那里，向他述说所遭遇的一切事；
{Jos 2:24}  And they said to Joshua, "Truly the LORD has given all the land into our hands. And also, all the inhabitants of the land melt away because of us."
{Jos 2:24}  又对约书亚说：“耶和华果然将那全地交在我们手中；那地的一切居民在我们面前心都消化了。”
{Jos 3:1}   Then Joshua rose early in the morning and they set out from Shittim. And they came to the Jordan, he and all the people of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
{Jos 3:1}   约书亚清早起来，和以色列众人都离开什亭，来到约但河，就住在那里，等候过河。
{Jos 3:2}   At the end of three days the officers went through the camp
{Jos 3:2}   过了三天，官长走遍营中，
{Jos 3:3}   and commanded the people, "As soon as you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place and follow it.
{Jos 3:3}   吩咐百姓说：“你们看见耶和华你们神的约柜，又见祭司利未人抬着，就要离开所住的地方，跟着约柜去。
{Jos 3:4}   Yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about 2,000 cubits in length. Do not come near it, in order that you may know the way you shall go, for you have not passed this way before."
{Jos 3:4}   只是你们和约柜相离要量二千肘，不可与约柜相近，使你们知道所当走的路，因为这条路你们向来没有走过。”
{Jos 3:5}   Then Joshua said to the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you."
{Jos 3:5}   约书亚吩咐百姓说：“你们要自洁，因为明天耶和华必在你们中间行奇事。”
{Jos 3:6}   And Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on before the people." So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.
{Jos 3:6}   约书亚又吩咐祭司说：“你们抬起约柜，在百姓前头过去。”于是他们抬起约柜，在百姓前头走。
{Jos 3:7}   The LORD said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
{Jos 3:7}   耶和华对约书亚说：“从今日起，我必使你在以色列众人眼前尊大，使他们知道我怎样与摩西同在，也必照样与你同在。
{Jos 3:8}   And as for you, command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"
{Jos 3:8}   你要吩咐抬约柜的祭司说：‘你们到了约但河的水边上，就要在约但河水里站住。’”
{Jos 3:9}   And Joshua said to the people of Israel, "Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God."
{Jos 3:9}   约书亚对以色列人说：“你们近前来，听耶和华你们神的话。”
{Jos 3:10}  And Joshua said, "Here is how you shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
{Jos 3:10}  (SEE 3:11)
{Jos 3:11}  Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is passing over before you into the Jordan.
{Jos 3:11}  约书亚说：“看哪，普天下主的约柜必在你们前头过去，到约但河里，因此你们就知道在你们中间有永生神；并且他必在你们面前赶出迦南人、赫人、希未人、比利洗人、革迦撒人、亚摩利人、耶布斯人。
{Jos 3:12}  Now therefore take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, from each tribe a man.
{Jos 3:12}  你们现在要从以色列支派中拣选十二个人，每支派一人，
{Jos 3:13}  And when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from flowing, and the waters coming down from above shall stand in one heap."
{Jos 3:13}  等到抬普天下主耶和华约柜的祭司把脚站在约但河水里，约但河的水，就是从上往下流的水，必然断绝，立起成垒。”
{Jos 3:14}  So when the people set out from their tents to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,
{Jos 3:14}  百姓离开帐棚要过约但河的时候，抬约柜的祭司乃在百姓的前头。
{Jos 3:15}  and as soon as those bearing the ark had come as far as the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest),
{Jos 3:15}  他们到了约但河，脚一入水（原来约但河水在收割的日子涨过两岸），
{Jos 3:16}  the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far away, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite Jericho.
{Jos 3:16}  那从上往下流的水便在极远之地、撒拉旦旁的亚当城那里停住，立起成垒；那往亚拉巴的海，就是盐海，下流的水全然断绝。于是百姓在耶利哥的对面过去了。
{Jos 3:17}  Now the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firmly on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all Israel was passing over on dry ground until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.
{Jos 3:17}  抬耶和华约柜的祭司在约但河中的干地上站定，以色列众人都从干地上过去，直到国民尽都过了约但河。
{Jos 4:1}   When all the nation had finished passing over the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,
{Jos 4:1}   国民尽都过了约但河，耶和华就对约书亚说：
{Jos 4:2}   "Take twelve men from the people, from each tribe a man,
{Jos 4:2}   “你从民中要拣选十二个人，每支派一人，
{Jos 4:3}   and command them, saying, 'Take twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests' feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you and lay them down in the place where you lodge tonight.'"
{Jos 4:3}   吩咐他们说：‘你们从这里，从约但河中、祭司脚站定的地方，取十二块石头带过去，放在你们今夜要住宿的地方。’”
{Jos 4:4}   Then Joshua called the twelve men from the people of Israel, whom he had appointed, a man from each tribe.
{Jos 4:4}   于是，约书亚将他从以色列人中所预备的那十二个人，每支派一人，都召了来。
{Jos 4:5}   And Joshua said to them, "Pass on before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take up each of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel,
{Jos 4:5}   对他们说：“你们下约但河中，过到耶和华你们神的约柜前头，按着以色列人十二支派的数目，每人取一块石头扛在肩上。
{Jos 4:6}   that this may be a sign among you. When your children ask in time to come, 'What do those stones mean to you?'
{Jos 4:6}   这些石头在你们中间可以作为证据。日后，你们的子孙问你们说：‘这些石头是什么意思？’
{Jos 4:7}   then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the people of Israel a memorial forever."
{Jos 4:7}   你们就对他们说：‘这是因为约但河的水在耶和华的约柜前断绝；约柜过约但河的时候，约但河的水就断绝了。这些石头要作以色列人永远的纪念。’”
{Jos 4:8}   And the people of Israel did just as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, just as the LORD told Joshua. And they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down there.
{Jos 4:8}   以色列人就照约书亚所吩咐的，按着以色列人支派的数目，从约但河中取了十二块石头，都遵耶和华所吩咐约书亚的行了。他们把石头带过去，到他们所住宿的地方，就放在那里。
{Jos 4:9}   And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day.
{Jos 4:9}   约书亚另把十二块石头立在约但河中，在抬约柜的祭司脚站立的地方；直到今日，那石头还在那里。
{Jos 4:10}  For the priests bearing the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people passed over in haste.
{Jos 4:10}  抬约柜的祭司站在约但河中，等到耶和华晓谕约书亚吩咐百姓的事办完了，是照摩西所吩咐约书亚的一切话。于是百姓急速过去了。
{Jos 4:11}  And when all the people had finished passing over, the ark of the LORD and the priests passed over before the people.
{Jos 4:11}  众百姓尽都过了河，耶和华的约柜和祭司就在百姓面前过去。
{Jos 4:12}  The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the people of Israel, as Moses had told them.
{Jos 4:12}  流便人、迦得人、玛拿西半支派的人都照摩西所吩咐他们的，带着兵器在以色列人前头过去。
{Jos 4:13}  About 40,000 ready for war passed over before the LORD for battle, to the plains of Jericho.
{Jos 4:13}  约有四万人都准备打仗，在耶和华面前过去，到耶利哥的平原，等候上阵。
{Jos 4:14}  On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they stood in awe of him just as they had stood in awe of Moses, all the days of his life.
{Jos 4:14}  当那日，耶和华使约书亚在以色列众人眼前尊大。在他平生的日子，百姓敬畏他，像从前敬畏摩西一样。
{Jos 4:15}  And the LORD said to Joshua,
{Jos 4:15}  耶和华晓谕约书亚说：
{Jos 4:16}  "Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan."
{Jos 4:16}  “你吩咐抬法柜的祭司从约但河里上来。”
{Jos 4:17}  So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan."
{Jos 4:17}  约书亚就吩咐祭司说：“你们从约但河里上来。”
{Jos 4:18}  And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up on dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks, as before.
{Jos 4:18}  抬耶和华约柜的祭司从约但河里上来，脚掌刚落旱地，约但河的水就流到原处，仍旧涨过两岸。
{Jos 4:19}  The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped at Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.
{Jos 4:19}  正月初十日，百姓从约但河里上来，就在吉甲，在耶利哥的东边安营。
{Jos 4:20}  And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal.
{Jos 4:20}  他们从约但河中取来的那十二块石头，约书亚就立在吉甲，
{Jos 4:21}  And he said to the people of Israel, "When your children ask their fathers in times to come, 'What do these stones mean?'
{Jos 4:21}  对以色列人说：“日后你们的子孙问他们的父亲说：‘这些石头是什么意思？’
{Jos 4:22}  then you shall let your children know, 'Israel passed over this Jordan on dry ground.'
{Jos 4:22}  你们就告诉他们说：‘以色列人曾走干地过这约但河；
{Jos 4:23}  For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we passed over,
{Jos 4:23}  因为耶和华你们的神在你们前面使约但河的水干了，等着你们过来，就如耶和华你们的神从前在我们前面使红海干了，等着我们过来一样，
{Jos 4:24}  so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, that you may fear the LORD your God forever."
{Jos 4:24}  要使地上万民都知道，耶和华的手大有能力，也要使你们永远敬畏耶和华你们的神。’”
{Jos 5:1}   As soon as all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel until they had crossed over, their hearts melted and there was no longer any spirit in them because of the people of Israel.
{Jos 5:1}   约但河西亚摩利人的诸王和靠海迦南人的诸王，听见耶和华在以色列人前面使约但河的水干了，等到我们过去，他们的心因以色列人的缘故就消化了，不再有胆气。
{Jos 5:2}   At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time."
{Jos 5:2}   那时，耶和华吩咐约书亚说：“你制造火石刀，第二次给以色列人行割礼。”
{Jos 5:3}   So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
{Jos 5:3}   约书亚就制造了火石刀，在“除皮山”那里给以色列人行割礼。
{Jos 5:4}   And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way after they had come out of Egypt.
{Jos 5:4}   约书亚行割礼的缘故，是因为从埃及出来的众民，就是一切能打仗的男丁，出了埃及以后，都死在旷野的路上。
{Jos 5:5}   Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people who were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
{Jos 5:5}   因为出来的众民都受过割礼；惟独出埃及以后、在旷野的路上所生的众民都没有受过割礼。
{Jos 5:6}   For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished, because they did not obey the voice of the LORD; the LORD swore to them that he would not let them see the land that the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
{Jos 5:6}   以色列人在旷野走了四十年，等到国民，就是出埃及的兵丁，都消灭了，因为他们没有听从耶和华的话。耶和华曾向他们起誓，必不容他们看见耶和华向他们列祖起誓、应许赐给我们的地，就是流奶与蜜之地。
{Jos 5:7}   So it was their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.
{Jos 5:7}   他们的子孙，就是耶和华所兴起来接续他们的，都没有受过割礼；因为在路上没有给他们行割礼，约书亚这才给他们行了。
{Jos 5:8}   When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed.
{Jos 5:8}   国民都受完了割礼，就住在营中自己的地方，等到痊愈了。
{Jos 5:9}   And the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." And so the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.
{Jos 5:9}   耶和华对约书亚说：“我今日将埃及的羞辱从你们身上辊去了。”因此，那地方名叫吉甲（就是滚的意思），直到今日。
{Jos 5:10}  While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho.
{Jos 5:10}  以色列人在吉甲安营。正月十四日晚上，在耶利哥的平原守逾越节。
{Jos 5:11}  And the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.
{Jos 5:11}  逾越节的次日，他们就吃了那地的出产；正当那日吃无酵饼和烘的谷。
{Jos 5:12}  And the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land. And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
{Jos 5:12}  他们吃了那地的出产，第二日吗哪就止住了，以色列人也不再有吗哪了。那一年，他们却吃迦南地的出产。
{Jos 5:13}  When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing before him with his drawn sword in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"
{Jos 5:13}  约书亚靠近耶利哥的时候，举目观看，不料，有一个人手里有拔出来的刀，对面站立。约书亚到他那里，问他说：“你是帮助我们呢，是帮助我们敌人呢？”
{Jos 5:14}  And he said, "No; but I am the commander of the army of the LORD. Now I have come." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"
{Jos 5:14}  他回答说：“不是的，我来是要作耶和华军队的元帅。”约书亚就俯伏在地下拜，说：“我主有什么话吩咐仆人。”
{Jos 5:15}  And the commander of the LORD's army said to Joshua, "Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.
{Jos 5:15}  耶和华军队的元帅对约书亚说：“把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站的地方是圣的。”约书亚就照着行了。
{Jos 6:1}   Now Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel. None went out, and none came in.
{Jos 6:1}   耶利哥的城门因以色列人就关得严紧，无人出入。
{Jos 6:2}   And the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and mighty men of valor.
{Jos 6:2}   耶和华晓谕约书亚说：“看哪，我已经把耶利哥和耶利哥的王，并大能的勇士，都交在你手中。
{Jos 6:3}   You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. Thus shall you do for six days.
{Jos 6:3}   你们的一切兵丁要围绕这城，一日围绕一次，六日都要这样行。
{Jos 6:4}   Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
{Jos 6:4}   七个祭司要拿七个羊角走在约柜前。到第七日，你们要绕城七次，祭司也要吹角。
{Jos 6:5}   And when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, everyone straight before him."
{Jos 6:5}   他们吹的角声拖长，你们听见角声，众百姓要大声呼喊，城墙就必塌陷，各人都要往前直上。”
{Jos 6:6}   So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD."
{Jos 6:6}   嫩的儿子约书亚召了祭司来，吩咐他们说：“你们抬起约柜来，要有七个祭司拿七个羊角走在耶和华的约柜前”；
{Jos 6:7}   And he said to the people, "Go forward. March around the city and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the LORD."
{Jos 6:7}   又对百姓说：“你们前去绕城，带兵器的要走在耶和华的约柜前。”
{Jos 6:8}   And just as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the LORD went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD following them.
{Jos 6:8}   约书亚对百姓说完了话，七个祭司拿七个羊角走在耶和华面前吹角；耶和华的约柜在他们后面跟随。
{Jos 6:9}   The armed men were walking before the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and the rear guard was walking after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually.
{Jos 6:9}   带兵器的走在吹角的祭司前面，后队随着约柜行。祭司一面走一面吹。
{Jos 6:10}  But Joshua commanded the people, "You shall not shout or make your voice heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout."
{Jos 6:10}  约书亚吩咐百姓说：“你们不可呼喊，不可出声，连一句话也不可出你们的口，等到我吩咐你们呼喊的日子，那时才可以呼喊。”
{Jos 6:11}  So he caused the ark of the LORD to circle the city, going about it once. And they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.
{Jos 6:11}  这样，他使耶和华的约柜绕城，把城绕了一次；众人回到营里，就在营里住宿。
{Jos 6:12}  Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
{Jos 6:12}  约书亚清早起来，祭司又抬起耶和华的约柜。
{Jos 6:13}  And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD walked on, and they blew the trumpets continually. And the armed men were walking before them, and the rear guard was walking after the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets blew continually.
{Jos 6:13}  七个祭司拿七个羊角在耶和华的约柜前，时常行走吹角；带兵器的在他们前面走，后队随着耶和华的约柜行。祭司一面走一面吹。
{Jos 6:14}  And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.
{Jos 6:14}  第二日，众人把城绕了一次，就回营里去。六日都是这样行。
{Jos 6:15}  On the seventh day they rose early, at the dawn of day, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.
{Jos 6:15}  第七日清早，黎明的时候，他们起来，照样绕城七次；惟独这日把城绕了七次。
{Jos 6:16}  And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for the LORD has given you the city.
{Jos 6:16}  到了第七次，祭司吹角的时候，约书亚吩咐百姓说：“呼喊吧，因为耶和华已经把城交给你们了！
{Jos 6:17}  And the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.
{Jos 6:17}  这城和其中所有的都要在耶和华面前毁灭；只有妓女喇合与他家中所有的可以存活，因为他隐藏了我们所打发的使者。
{Jos 6:18}  But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for destruction and bring trouble upon it.
{Jos 6:18}  至于你们，务要谨慎，不可取那当灭的物，恐怕你们取了那当灭的物就连累以色列的全营，使全营受咒诅。
{Jos 6:19}  But all silver and gold, and every vessel of bronze and iron, are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD."
{Jos 6:19}  惟有金子、银子，和铜铁的器皿都要归耶和华为圣，必入耶和华的库中。”
{Jos 6:20}  So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.
{Jos 6:20}  于是百姓呼喊，祭司也吹角。百姓听见角声，便大声呼喊，城墙就塌陷，百姓便上去进城，各人往前直上，将城夺取；
{Jos 6:21}  Then they devoted all in the city to destruction, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, with the edge of the sword.
{Jos 6:21}  又将城中所有的，不拘男女老少，牛羊和驴，都用刀杀尽。
{Jos 6:22}  But to the two men who had spied out the land, Joshua said, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, as you swore to her."
{Jos 6:22}  约书亚吩咐窥探地的两个人说：“你们进那妓女的家，照着你们向他所起的誓，将那女人和他所有的都从那里带出来。”
{Jos 6:23}  So the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. And they brought all her relatives and put them outside the camp of Israel.
{Jos 6:23}  当探子的两个少年人就进去，将喇合与他的父母、弟兄，和他所有的，并他一切的亲眷，都带出来，安置在以色列的营外。
{Jos 6:24}  And they burned the city with fire, and everything in it. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
{Jos 6:24}  众人就用火将城和其中所有的焚烧了；惟有金子、银子，和铜铁的器皿都放在耶和华殿的库中。
{Jos 6:25}  But Rahab the prostitute and her father's household and all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive. And she has lived in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
{Jos 6:25}  约书亚却把妓女喇合与他父家，并他所有的，都救活了；因为他隐藏了约书亚所打发窥探耶利哥的使者，他就住在以色列中，直到今日。
{Jos 6:26}  Joshua laid an oath on them at that time, saying, "Cursed before the LORD be the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho. "At the cost of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."
{Jos 6:26}  当时，约书亚叫众人起誓说：“有兴起重修这耶利哥城的人，当在耶和华面前受咒诅。他立根基的时候，必丧长子，安门的时候，必丧幼子。”
{Jos 6:27}  So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.
{Jos 6:27}  耶和华与约书亚同在，约书亚的声名传扬遍地。
{Jos 7:1}   But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things, for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the LORD burned against the people of Israel.
{Jos 7:1}   以色列人在当灭的物上犯了罪；因为犹大支派中，谢拉的曾孙，撒底的孙子，迦米的儿子亚干取了当灭的物；耶和华的怒气就向以色列人发作。
{Jos 7:2}   Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, "Go up and spy out the land." And the men went up and spied out Ai.
{Jos 7:2}   当下，约书亚从耶利哥打发人往伯特利东边、靠近伯亚文的艾城去，吩咐他们说：“你们上去窥探那地。”他们就上去窥探艾城。
{Jos 7:3}   And they returned to Joshua and said to him, "Do not have all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are few."
{Jos 7:3}   他们回到约书亚那里，对他说：“众民不必都上去，只要二三千人上去就能攻取艾城；不必劳累众民都去，因为那里的人少。”
{Jos 7:4}   So about three thousand men went up there from the people. And they fled before the men of Ai,
{Jos 7:4}   于是民中约有三千人上那里去，竟在艾城人面前逃跑了。
{Jos 7:5}   and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six of their men and chased them before the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became as water.
{Jos 7:5}   艾城的人击杀了他们三十六人，从城门前追赶他们，直到示巴琳，在下坡杀败他们；众民的心就消化如水。
{Jos 7:6}   Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they put dust on their heads.
{Jos 7:6}   约书亚便撕裂衣服；他和以色列的长老把灰撒在头上，在耶和华的约柜前俯伏在地，直到晚上。
{Jos 7:7}   And Joshua said, "Alas, O Lord GOD, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!
{Jos 7:7}   约书亚说：“哀哉！主耶和华啊，你为什么竟领这百姓过约但河，将我们交在亚摩利人的手中，使我们灭亡呢？我们不如住在约但河那边倒好。
{Jos 7:8}   O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!
{Jos 7:8}   主啊，以色列人既在仇敌面前转背逃跑，我还有什么可说的呢？
{Jos 7:9}   For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will you do for your great name?"
{Jos 7:9}   迦南人和这地一切的居民听见了就必围困我们，将我们的名从地上除灭。那时你为你的大名要怎样行呢？”
{Jos 7:10}  The LORD said to Joshua, "Get up! Why have you fallen on your face?
{Jos 7:10}  耶和华吩咐约书亚说：“起来！你为何这样俯伏在地呢？
{Jos 7:11}  Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen and lied and put them among their own belongings.
{Jos 7:11}  以色列人犯了罪，违背了我所吩咐他们的约，取了当灭的物；又偷窃，又行诡诈，又把那当灭的放在他们的家具里。
{Jos 7:12}  Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.
{Jos 7:12}  因此，以色列人在仇敌面前站立不住。他们在仇敌面前转背逃跑，是因成了被咒诅的；你们若不把当灭的物从你们中间除掉，我就不再与你们同在了。
{Jos 7:13}  Get up! Consecrate the people and say, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, God of Israel, "There are devoted things in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you."
{Jos 7:13}  你起来，叫百姓自洁，对他们说：‘你们要自洁，预备明天，因为耶和华以色列的神这样说：以色列啊，你们中间有当灭的物，你们若不除掉，在仇敌面前必站立不住！’
{Jos 7:14}  In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. And the tribe that the LORD takes by lot shall come near by clans. And the clan that the LORD takes shall come near by households. And the household that the LORD takes shall come near man by man.
{Jos 7:14}  到了早晨，你们要按着支派近前来；耶和华所取的支派，要按着宗族近前来；耶和华所取的宗族，要按着家室近前来；耶和华所取的家室，要按着人丁，一个一个的近前来。
{Jos 7:15}  And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has done an outrageous thing in Israel.'"
{Jos 7:15}  被取的人有当灭的物在他那里，他和他所有的必被火焚烧；因他违背了耶和华的约，又因他在以色列中行了愚妄的事。”
{Jos 7:16}  So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
{Jos 7:16}  于是，约书亚清早起来，使以色列人按着支派近前来，取出来的是犹大支派；
{Jos 7:17}  And he brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken. And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.
{Jos 7:17}  使犹大支派（原文作宗族）近前来，就取了谢拉的宗族；使谢拉的宗族，按着家室人丁，一个一个的近前来，取出来的是撒底；
{Jos 7:18}  And he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
{Jos 7:18}  使撒底的家室，按着人丁，一个一个的近前来，就取出犹大支派的人谢拉的曾孙，撒底的孙子，迦米的儿子亚干。
{Jos 7:19}  Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD God of Israel and give praise to him. And tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me."
{Jos 7:19}  约书亚对亚干说：“我儿，我劝你将荣耀归给耶和华以色列的神，在他面前认罪，将你所做的事告诉我，不要向我隐瞒。”
{Jos 7:20}  And Achan answered Joshua, "Truly I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I did:
{Jos 7:20}  亚干回答约书亚说：“我实在得罪了耶和华以色列的神。我所做的事如此如此：
{Jos 7:21}  when I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar, and 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels, then I coveted them and took them. And see, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath."
{Jos 7:21}  我在所夺的财物中看见一件美好的示拿衣服，二百舍客勒银子，一条金子重五十舍客勒，我就贪爱这些物件，便拿去了。现今藏在我帐棚内的地里，银子在衣服底下。”
{Jos 7:22}  So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.
{Jos 7:22}  约书亚就打发人跑到亚干的帐棚里。那件衣服果然藏在他帐棚内，银子在底下。
{Jos 7:23}  And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel. And they laid them down before the LORD.
{Jos 7:23}  他们就从帐棚里取出来，拿到约书亚和以色列众人那里，放在耶和华面前。
{Jos 7:24}  And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters and his oxen and donkeys and sheep and his tent and all that he had. And they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.
{Jos 7:24}  约书亚和以色列众人把谢拉的曾孙亚干和那银子、那件衣服、那条金子，并亚干的儿女、牛、驴、羊、帐棚，以及他所有的，都带到亚割谷去。
{Jos 7:25}  And Joshua said, "Why did you bring trouble on us? The LORD brings trouble on you today." And all Israel stoned him with stones. They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.
{Jos 7:25}  约书亚说：“你为什么连累我们呢？今日耶和华必叫你受连累。”于是以色列众人用石头打死他，将石头扔在其上，又用火焚烧他所有的（原文作他们）。
{Jos 7:26}  And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his burning anger. Therefore, to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor.
{Jos 7:26}  众人在亚干身上堆成一大堆石头，直存到今日。于是耶和华转意，不发他的烈怒。因此那地方名叫亚割谷（就是连累的意思），直到今日。
{Jos 8:1}   And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Take all the fighting men with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, his city, and his land.
{Jos 8:1}   耶和华对约书亚说：“不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。你起来，率领一切兵丁上艾城去，我已经把艾城的王和他的民、他的城，并他的地，都交在你手里。
{Jos 8:2}   And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoil and its livestock you shall take as plunder for yourselves. Lay an ambush against the city, behind it."
{Jos 8:2}   你怎样待耶利哥和耶利哥的王，也当照样待艾城和艾城的王。只是城内所夺的财物和牲畜，你们可以取为自己的掠物。你要在城后设下伏兵。
{Jos 8:3}   So Joshua and all the fighting men arose to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out by night.
{Jos 8:3}   于是，约书亚和一切兵丁都起来，要上艾城去。约书亚选了三万大能的勇士，夜间打发他们前往，
{Jos 8:4}   And he commanded them, "Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you remain ready.
{Jos 8:4}   吩咐他们说：“你们要在城后埋伏，不可离城太远，都要各自准备。
{Jos 8:5}   And I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out against us just as before, we shall flee before them.
{Jos 8:5}   我与我所带领的众民要向城前往。城里的人像初次出来攻击我们的时候，我们就在他们面前逃跑，
{Jos 8:6}   And they will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city. For they will say, 'They are fleeing from us, just as before.' So we will flee before them.
{Jos 8:6}   他们必出来追赶我们，直到我们引诱他们离开城；因为他们必说：‘这些人像初次在我们面前逃跑。’所以我们要在他们面前逃跑，
{Jos 8:7}   Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will give it into your hand.
{Jos 8:7}   你们就从埋伏的地方起来，夺取那城，因为耶和华你们的神必把城交在你们手里。
{Jos 8:8}   And as soon as you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire. You shall do according to the word of the LORD. See, I have commanded you."
{Jos 8:8}   你们夺了城以后，就放火烧城，要照耶和华的话行。这是我吩咐你们的。”
{Jos 8:9}   So Joshua sent them out. And they went to the place of ambush and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai, but Joshua spent that night among the people.
{Jos 8:9}   约书亚打发他们前往，他们就上埋伏的地方去，住在伯特利和艾城的中间，就是在艾城的西边。这夜约书亚却在民中住宿。
{Jos 8:10}  Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
{Jos 8:10}  约书亚清早起来，点齐百姓，他和以色列的长老在百姓前面上艾城去。
{Jos 8:11}  And all the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai.
{Jos 8:11}  众民，就是他所带领的兵丁，都上去，向前直往，来到城前，在艾城北边安营。在约书亚和艾城中间有一山谷。
{Jos 8:12}  He took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
{Jos 8:12}  他挑了约有五千人，使他们埋伏在伯特利和艾城的中间，就是在艾城的西边，
{Jos 8:13}  So they stationed the forces, the main encampment that was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley.
{Jos 8:13}  于是安置了百姓，就是城北的全军和城西的伏兵。这夜约书亚进入山谷之中。
{Jos 8:14}  And as soon as the king of Ai saw this, he and all his people, the men of the city, hurried and went out early to the appointed place toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
{Jos 8:14}  艾城的王看见这景况，就和全城的人，清早急忙起来，按所定的时候，出到亚拉巴前，要与以色列人交战；王却不知道在城后有伏兵。
{Jos 8:15}  And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled in the direction of the wilderness.
{Jos 8:15}  约书亚和以色列众人在他们面前装败，往那通旷野的路逃跑。
{Jos 8:16}  So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city.
{Jos 8:16}  城内的众民都被招聚，追赶他们；艾城人追赶的时候，就被引诱离开城。
{Jos 8:17}  Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. They left the city open and pursued Israel.
{Jos 8:17}  艾城和伯特利城没有一人不出来追赶以色列人的，撇了敞开的城门，去追赶以色列人。
{Jos 8:18}  Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
{Jos 8:18}  耶和华吩咐约书亚说：“你向艾城伸出手里的短枪，因为我要将城交在你手里。”约书亚就向城伸出手里的短枪。
{Jos 8:19}  And the men in the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it. And they hurried to set the city on fire.
{Jos 8:19}  他一伸手，伏兵就从埋伏的地方急忙起来，夺了城，跑进城去，放火焚烧。
{Jos 8:20}  So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that, for the people who fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers.
{Jos 8:20}  艾城的人回头一看，不料，城中烟气冲天，他们就无力向左向右逃跑。那往旷野逃跑的百姓便转身攻击追赶他们的人。
{Jos 8:21}  And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.
{Jos 8:21}  约书亚和以色列众人见伏兵已经夺了城，城中烟气飞腾，就转身回去，击杀艾城的人。
{Jos 8:22}  And the others came out from the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. And Israel struck them down, until there was left none that survived or escaped.
{Jos 8:22}  伏兵也出城迎击艾城人，艾城人就困在以色列人中间，前后都是以色列人。于是以色列人击杀他们，没有留下一个，也没有一个逃脱的，
{Jos 8:23}  But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him near to Joshua.
{Jos 8:23}  生擒了艾城的王，将他解到约书亚那里。
{Jos 8:24}  When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the edge of the sword.
{Jos 8:24}  以色列人在田间和旷野杀尽所追赶一切艾城的居民。艾城人倒在刀下，直到灭尽；以色列众人就回到艾城，用刀杀了城中的人。
{Jos 8:25}  And all who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000, all the people of Ai.
{Jos 8:25}  当日杀毙的人，连男带女共有一万二千，就是艾城所有的人。
{Jos 8:26}  But Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to destruction.
{Jos 8:26}  约书亚没有收回手里所伸出来的短枪，直到把艾城的一切居民尽行杀灭。
{Jos 8:27}  Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as their plunder, according to the word of the LORD that he commanded Joshua.
{Jos 8:27}  惟独城中的牲畜和财物，以色列人都取为自己的掠物，是照耶和华所吩咐约书亚的话。
{Jos 8:28}  So Joshua burned Ai and made it forever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day.
{Jos 8:28}  约书亚将艾城焚烧，使城永为高堆、荒场，直到今日；
{Jos 8:29}  And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening. And at sunset Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.
{Jos 8:29}  又将艾城王挂在树上，直到晚上。日落的时候，约书亚吩咐人把尸首从树上取下来，丢在城门口，在尸首上堆成一大堆石头，直存到今日。
{Jos 8:30}  At that time Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,
{Jos 8:30}  那时，约书亚在以巴路山上为耶和华以色列的神筑一座坛，
{Jos 8:31}  just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the people of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, "an altar of uncut stones, upon which no man has wielded an iron tool." And they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings.
{Jos 8:31}  是用没有动过铁器的整石头筑的，照着耶和华仆人摩西所吩咐以色列人的话，正如摩西律法书上所写的。众人在这坛上给耶和华奉献燔祭和平安祭。
{Jos 8:32}  And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.
{Jos 8:32}  约书亚在那里，当着以色列人面前，将摩西所写的律法抄写在石头上。
{Jos 8:33}  And all Israel, sojourner as well as native born, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the first, to bless the people of Israel.
{Jos 8:33}  以色列众人，无论是本地人、是寄居的，和长老、官长，并审判官，都站在约柜两旁，在抬耶和华约柜的祭司利未人面前，一半对着基利心山，一半对着以巴路山，为以色列民祝福，正如耶和华仆人摩西先前所吩咐的。
{Jos 8:34}  And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.
{Jos 8:34}  随后，约书亚将律法上祝福、咒诅的话，照着律法书上一切所写的，都宣读了一遍。
{Jos 8:35}  There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them.
{Jos 8:35}  摩西所吩咐的一切话，约书亚在以色列全会众和妇女、孩子，并他们中间寄居的外人面前，没有一句不宣读的。
{Jos 9:1}   As soon as all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, heard of this,
{Jos 9:1}   约但河西，住山地、高原，并对着利巴嫩山沿大海一带的诸王，就是赫人、亚摩利人、迦南人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的诸王，听见这事，
{Jos 9:2}   they gathered together as one to fight against Joshua and Israel.
{Jos 9:2}   就都聚集，同心合意的要与约书亚和以色列人争战。
{Jos 9:3}   But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
{Jos 9:3}   基遍的居民听见约书亚向耶利哥和艾城所行的事，
{Jos 9:4}   they on their part acted with cunning and went and made ready provisions and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended,
{Jos 9:4}   就设诡计，假充使者，拿旧口袋和破裂缝补的旧皮酒袋驮在驴上，
{Jos 9:5}   with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes. And all their provisions were dry and crumbly.
{Jos 9:5}   将补过的旧鞋穿在脚上，把旧衣服穿在身上；他们所带的饼都是干的，长了霉了。
{Jos 9:6}   And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant country, so now make a covenant with us."
{Jos 9:6}   他们到吉甲营中见约书亚，对他和以色列人说：“我们是从远方来的，现在求你与我们立约。”
{Jos 9:7}   But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, "Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a covenant with you?"
{Jos 9:7}   以色列人对这些希未人说：“只怕你们是住在我们中间的；若是这样，怎能和你们立约呢？”
{Jos 9:8}   They said to Joshua, "We are your servants." And Joshua said to them, "Who are you? And where do you come from?"
{Jos 9:8}   他们对约书亚说：“我们是你的仆人。”约书亚问他们说：“你们是什么人？是从那里来的？”
{Jos 9:9}   They said to him, "From a very distant country your servants have come, because of the name of the LORD your God. For we have heard a report of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
{Jos 9:9}   他们回答说：“仆人从极远之地而来，是因听见耶和华你神的名声和他在埃及所行的一切事，
{Jos 9:10}  and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.
{Jos 9:10}  并他向约但河东的两个亚摩利王，就是希实本王西宏和在亚斯他录的巴珊王噩一切所行的事。
{Jos 9:11}  So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, 'Take provisions in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say to them, "We are your servants. Come now, make a covenant with us."'
{Jos 9:11}  我们的长老和我们那地的一切居民对我们说：‘你们手里要带着路上用的食物去迎接以色列人，对他们说：我们是你们的仆人；现在求你们与我们立约。’
{Jos 9:12}  Here is our bread. It was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey on the day we set out to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and crumbly.
{Jos 9:12}  我们出来要往你们这里来的日子，从家里带出来的这饼还是热的；看哪，现在都干了，长了霉了。
{Jos 9:13}  These wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they have burst. And these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey."
{Jos 9:13}  这皮酒袋，我们盛酒的时候还是新的；看哪，现在已经破裂。我们这衣服和鞋，因为道路甚远，也都穿旧了。”
{Jos 9:14}  So the men took some of their provisions, but did not ask counsel from the LORD.
{Jos 9:14}  以色列人受了他们些食物，并没有求问耶和华。
{Jos 9:15}  And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.
{Jos 9:15}  于是约书亚与他们讲和，与他们立约，容他们活着；会众的首领也向他们起誓。
{Jos 9:16}  At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and that they lived among them.
{Jos 9:16}  以色列人与他们立约之后，过了三天才听见他们是近邻，住在以色列人中间的。
{Jos 9:17}  And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
{Jos 9:17}  以色列人起行，第三天到了他们的城邑，就是基遍、基非拉、比录、基列耶琳。
{Jos 9:18}  But the people of Israel did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders.
{Jos 9:18}  因为会众的首领已经指着耶和华以色列的神向他们起誓，所以以色列人不击杀他们；全会众就向首领发怨言。
{Jos 9:19}  But all the leaders said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.
{Jos 9:19}  众首领对全会众说：“我们已经指着耶和华以色列的神向他们起誓，现在我们不能害他们。
{Jos 9:20}  This we will do to them: let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath that we swore to them."
{Jos 9:20}  我们要如此待他们，容他们活着，免得有忿怒因我们所起的誓临到我们身上。”
{Jos 9:21}  And the leaders said to them, "Let them live." So they became cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, just as the leaders had said of them.
{Jos 9:21}  首领又对会众说：“要容他们活着。”于是他们为全会众作了劈柴挑水的人，正如首领对他们所说的话。
{Jos 9:22}  Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, "Why did you deceive us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you dwell among us?
{Jos 9:22}  约书亚召了他们来，对他们说：“为什么欺哄我们说‘我们离你们甚远’呢？其实你们是住在我们中间。
{Jos 9:23}  Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall never be anything but servants, cutters of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."
{Jos 9:23}  现在你们是被咒诅的！你们中间的人必断不了作奴仆，为我神的殿作劈柴挑水的人。”
{Jos 9:24}  They answered Joshua, "Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you--so we feared greatly for our lives because of you and did this thing.
{Jos 9:24}  他们回答约书亚说：“因为有人实在告诉你的仆人，耶和华你的神曾吩咐他的仆人摩西，把这全地赐给你们，并在你们面前灭绝这地的一切居民，所以我们为你们的缘故甚怕丧命，就行了这事。
{Jos 9:25}  And now, behold, we are in your hand. Whatever seems good and right in your sight to do to us, do it."
{Jos 9:25}  现在我们在你手中，你以怎样待我们为善为正，就怎样做吧！”
{Jos 9:26}  So he did this to them and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel, and they did not kill them.
{Jos 9:26}  于是约书亚这样待他们，救他们脱离以色列人的手，以色列人就没有杀他们。
{Jos 9:27}  But Joshua made them that day cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place that he should choose.
{Jos 9:27}  当日约书亚使他们在耶和华所要选择的地方，为会众和耶和华的坛作劈柴挑水的人，直到今日。
{Jos 10:1}  As soon as Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had captured Ai and had devoted it to destruction, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,
{Jos 10:1}  耶路撒冷王亚多尼洗德听见约书亚夺了艾城，尽行毁灭，怎样待耶利哥和耶利哥的王，也照样待艾城和艾城的王，又听见基遍的居民与以色列人立了和约，住在他们中间，
{Jos 10:2}  he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors.
{Jos 10:2}  就甚惧怕；因为基遍是一座大城，如都城一般，比艾城更大，并且城内的人都是勇士。
{Jos 10:3}  So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
{Jos 10:3}  所以耶路撒冷王亚多尼洗德打发人去见希伯仑王何咸、耶末王毗兰、拉吉王雅非亚，和伊矶伦王底璧，说：
{Jos 10:4}  "Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon. For it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel."
{Jos 10:4}  “求你们上来帮助我，我们好攻打基遍，因为他们与约书亚和以色列人立了和约。”
{Jos 10:5}  Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon and made war against it.
{Jos 10:5}  于是五个亚摩利王，就是耶路撒冷王、希伯仑王、耶末王、拉吉王、伊矶伦王，大家聚集，率领他们的众军上去，对着基遍安营，攻打基遍。
{Jos 10:6}  And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, "Do not relax your hand from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us."
{Jos 10:6}  基遍人就打发人往吉甲的营中去见约书亚，说：“你不要袖手不顾你的仆人，求你速速上来拯救我们，帮助我们，因为住山地亚摩利人的诸王都聚集攻击我们。”
{Jos 10:7}  So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
{Jos 10:7}  于是约书亚和他一切兵丁，并大能的勇士，都从吉甲上去。
{Jos 10:8}  And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands. Not a man of them shall stand before you."
{Jos 10:8}  耶和华对约书亚说：“不要怕他们；因为我已将他们交在你手里，他们无一人能在你面前站立得住。”
{Jos 10:9}  So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal.
{Jos 10:9}  约书亚就终夜从吉甲上去，猛然临到他们那里。
{Jos 10:10} And the LORD threw them into a panic before Israel, who struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
{Jos 10:10} 耶和华使他们在以色列人面前溃乱。约书亚在基遍大大的杀败他们，追赶他们，在伯和仑的上坡路击杀他们，直到亚西加和玛基大。
{Jos 10:11} And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-horon, the LORD threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died because of the hailstones than the sons of Israel killed with the sword.
{Jos 10:11} 他们在以色列人面前逃跑，正在伯和仑下坡的时候，耶和华从天上降大冰雹（原文作石头）在他们身上，直降到亚西加，打死他们。被冰雹打死的，比以色列人用刀杀死的还多。
{Jos 10:12} At that time Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, "Sun, stand still at Gibeon, and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon."
{Jos 10:12} 当耶和华将亚摩利人交付以色列人的日子，约书亚就祷告耶和华，在以色列人眼前说：日头啊，你要停在基遍；月亮啊，你要止在亚雅仑谷。
{Jos 10:13} And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day.
{Jos 10:13} 于是日头停留，月亮止住，直等国民向敌人报仇。这事岂不是写在雅煞珥书上吗？日头在天当中停住，不急速下落，约有一日之久。
{Jos 10:14} There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD heeded the voice of a man, for the LORD fought for Israel.
{Jos 10:14} 在这日以前，这日以后，耶和华听人的祷告，没有像这日的，是因耶和华为以色列争战。
{Jos 10:15} So Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
{Jos 10:15} 约书亚和以色列众人回到吉甲的营中。
{Jos 10:16} These five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
{Jos 10:16} 那五王逃跑，藏在玛基大洞里。
{Jos 10:17} And it was told to Joshua, "The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah."
{Jos 10:17} 有人告诉约书亚说：“那五王已经找到了，都藏在玛基大洞里。”
{Jos 10:18} And Joshua said, "Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them,
{Jos 10:18} 约书亚说：“你们把几块大石头滚到洞口，派人看守，
{Jos 10:19} but do not stay there yourselves. Pursue your enemies; attack their rear guard. Do not let them enter their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."
{Jos 10:19} 你们却不可耽延，要追赶你们的仇敌，击杀他们尽后边的人，不容他们进自己的城邑，因为耶和华你们的神已经把他们交在你们手里。”
{Jos 10:20} When Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them with a great blow until they were wiped out, and when the remnant that remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,
{Jos 10:20} 约书亚和以色列人大大杀败他们，直到将他们灭尽；其中剩下的人都进了坚固的城。
{Jos 10:21} then all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. Not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.
{Jos 10:21} 众百姓就安然回玛基大营中，到约书亚那里。没有一人敢向以色列人饶舌。
{Jos 10:22} Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me from the cave."
{Jos 10:22} 约书亚说：“打开洞口，将那五王从洞里带出来，领到我面前。”
{Jos 10:23} And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
{Jos 10:23} 众人就这样行，将那五王，就是耶路撒冷王、希伯仑王、耶末王、拉吉王、伊矶伦王，从洞里带出来，领到约书亚面前。
{Jos 10:24} And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, "Come near; put your feet on the necks of these kings." Then they came near and put their feet on their necks.
{Jos 10:24} 带出那五王到约书亚面前的时候，约书亚就召了以色列众人来，对那些和他同去的军长说：“你们近前来，把脚踏在这些王的颈项上。”他们就近前来，把脚踏在这些王的颈项上。
{Jos 10:25} And Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous. For thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight."
{Jos 10:25} 约书亚对他们说：“你们不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。应当刚强壮胆，因为耶和华必这样待你们所要攻打的一切仇敌。”
{Jos 10:26} And afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees. And they hung on the trees until evening.
{Jos 10:26} 随后约书亚将这五王杀死，挂在五棵树上。他们就在树上直挂到晚上。
{Jos 10:27} But at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set large stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.
{Jos 10:27} 日头要落的时候，约书亚一吩咐，人就把尸首从树上取下来，丢在他们藏过的洞里，把几块大石头放在洞口，直存到今日。
{Jos 10:28} As for Makkedah, Joshua captured it on that day and struck it, and its king, with the edge of the sword. He devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. And he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
{Jos 10:28} 当日，约书亚夺了玛基大，用刀击杀城中的人和王；将其中一切人口尽行杀灭，没有留下一个。他待玛基大王，像从前待耶利哥王一样。
{Jos 10:29} Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah.
{Jos 10:29} 约书亚和以色列众人从玛基大往立拿去，攻打立拿。
{Jos 10:30} And the LORD gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel. And he struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left none remaining in it. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
{Jos 10:30} 耶和华将立拿和立拿的王也交在以色列人手里。约书亚攻打这城，用刀击杀了城中的一切人口，没有留下一个。他待立拿王，像从前待耶利哥王一样。
{Jos 10:31} Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish and laid siege to it and fought against it.
{Jos 10:31} 约书亚和以色列众人从立拿往拉吉去，对着拉吉安营，攻打这城。
{Jos 10:32} And the LORD gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.
{Jos 10:32} 耶和华将拉吉交在以色列人的手里。第二天约书亚就夺了拉吉，用刀击杀了城中的一切人口，是照他向立拿一切所行的。
{Jos 10:33} Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. And Joshua struck him and his people, until he left none remaining.
{Jos 10:33} 那时基色王荷兰上来帮助拉吉，约书亚就把他和他的民都击杀了，没有留下一个。
{Jos 10:34} Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon. And they laid siege to it and fought against it.
{Jos 10:34} 约书亚和以色列众人从拉吉往伊矶伦去，对着伊矶伦安营，攻打这城。
{Jos 10:35} And they captured it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. And he devoted every person in it to destruction that day, as he had done to Lachish.
{Jos 10:35} 当日就夺了城，用刀击杀了城中的人。那日，约书亚将城中的一切人口尽行杀灭，是照他向拉吉一切所行的。
{Jos 10:36} Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron. And they fought against it
{Jos 10:36} 约书亚和以色列众人从伊矶伦上希伯仑去，攻打这城，
{Jos 10:37} and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it. He left none remaining, as he had done to Eglon, and devoted it to destruction and every person in it.
{Jos 10:37} 就夺了希伯仑和属希伯仑的诸城邑，用刀将城中的人与王，并那些城邑中的人口，都击杀了，没有留下一个，是照他向伊矶伦所行的，把城中的一切人口尽行杀灭。
{Jos 10:38} Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned back to Debir and fought against it
{Jos 10:38} 约书亚和以色列众人回到底璧，攻打这城，
{Jos 10:39} and he captured it with its king and all its towns. And they struck them with the edge of the sword and devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. Just as he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and to its king.
{Jos 10:39} 就夺了底璧和属底璧的城邑，又擒获底璧的王，用刀将这些城中的人口尽行杀灭，没有留下一个。他待底璧和底璧王，像从前待希伯仑和立拿与立拿王一样。
{Jos 10:40} So Joshua struck the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but devoted to destruction all that breathed, just as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
{Jos 10:40} 这样，约书亚击杀全地的人，就是山地、南地、高原、山坡的人，和那些地的诸王，没有留下一个。将凡有气息的尽行杀灭，正如耶和华以色列的神所吩咐的。
{Jos 10:41} And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, as far as Gibeon.
{Jos 10:41} 约书亚从加低斯巴尼亚攻击到迦萨，又攻击歌珊全地，直到基遍。
{Jos 10:42} And Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
{Jos 10:42} 约书亚一时杀败了这些王，并夺了他们的地，因为耶和华以色列的神为以色列争战。
{Jos 10:43} Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
{Jos 10:43} 于是约书亚和以色列众人回到吉甲的营中。
{Jos 11:1}  When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard of this, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
{Jos 11:1}  夏琐王耶宾听见这事，就打发人去见玛顿王约巴、伸仑王、押煞王，
{Jos 11:2}  and to the kings who were in the northern hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in Naphoth-dor on the west,
{Jos 11:2}  与北方山地、基尼烈南边的亚拉巴高原，并西边多珥山冈的诸王；
{Jos 11:3}  to the Canaanites in the east and the west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
{Jos 11:3}  又去见东方和西方的迦南人，与山地的亚摩利人、赫人、比利洗人、耶布斯人，并黑门山根米斯巴地的希未人。
{Jos 11:4}  And they came out with all their troops, a great horde, in number like the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.
{Jos 11:4}  这些王和他们的众军都出来，人数多如海边的沙，并有许多马匹车辆。
{Jos 11:5}  And all these kings joined their forces and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
{Jos 11:5}  这诸王会合，来到米伦水边，一同安营，要与以色列人争战。
{Jos 11:6}  And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, for tomorrow at this time I will give over all of them, slain, to Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire."
{Jos 11:6}  耶和华对约书亚说：“你不要因他们惧怕。明日这时，我必将他们交付以色列人全然杀了。你要砍断他们马的蹄筋，用火焚烧他们的车辆。”
{Jos 11:7}  So Joshua and all his warriors came suddenly against them by the waters of Merom and fell upon them.
{Jos 11:7}  于是约书亚率领一切兵丁，在米伦水边突然向前攻打他们。
{Jos 11:8}  And the LORD gave them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and chased them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. And they struck them until he left none remaining.
{Jos 11:8}  耶和华将他们交在以色列人手里，以色列人就击杀他们，追赶他们到西顿大城，到米斯利弗玛音，直到东边米斯巴的平原，将他们击杀，没有留下一个。
{Jos 11:9}  And Joshua did to them just as the LORD said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
{Jos 11:9}  约书亚就照耶和华所吩咐他的去行，砍断他们马的蹄筋，用火焚烧他们的车辆。
{Jos 11:10} And Joshua turned back at that time and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms.
{Jos 11:10} 当时，约书亚转回夺了夏琐，用刀击杀夏琐王。（素来夏琐在这诸国中是为首的。）
{Jos 11:11} And they struck with the sword all who were in it, devoting them to destruction; there was none left that breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire.
{Jos 11:11} 以色列人用刀击杀城中的人口，将他们尽行杀灭；凡有气息的没有留下一个。约书亚又用火焚烧夏琐。
{Jos 11:12} And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua captured, and struck them with the edge of the sword, devoting them to destruction, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded.
{Jos 11:12} 约书亚夺了这些王的一切城邑，擒获其中的诸王，用刀击杀他们，将他们尽行杀灭，正如耶和华仆人摩西所吩咐的。
{Jos 11:13} But none of the cities that stood on mounds did Israel burn, except Hazor alone; that Joshua burned.
{Jos 11:13} 至于造在山冈上的城，除了夏琐以外，以色列人都没有焚烧。约书亚只将夏琐焚烧了。
{Jos 11:14} And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the people of Israel took for their plunder. But every person they struck with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave any who breathed.
{Jos 11:14} 那些城邑所有的财物和牲畜，以色列人都取为自己的掠物；惟有一切人口都用刀击杀，直到杀尽；凡有气息的没有留下一个。
{Jos 11:15} Just as the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
{Jos 11:15} 耶和华怎样吩咐他仆人摩西，摩西就照样吩咐约书亚，约书亚也照样行。凡耶和华所吩咐摩西的，约书亚没有一件懈怠不行的。
{Jos 11:16} So Joshua took all that land, the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland
{Jos 11:16} 约书亚夺了那全地，就是山地、一带南地、歌珊全地、高原、亚拉巴、以色列的山地，和山下的高原。
{Jos 11:17} from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them and put them to death.
{Jos 11:17} 从上西珥的哈拉山，直到黑门山下利巴嫩平原的巴力迦得，并且擒获那些地的诸王，将他们杀死。
{Jos 11:18} Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
{Jos 11:18} 约书亚和这诸王争战了许多年日。
{Jos 11:19} There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took them all in battle.
{Jos 11:19} 除了基遍的希未人之外，没有一城与以色列人讲和的，都是以色列人争战夺来的。
{Jos 11:20} For it was the LORD's doing to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, in order that they should be devoted to destruction and should receive no mercy but be destroyed, just as the LORD commanded Moses.
{Jos 11:20} 因为耶和华的意思是要使他们心里刚硬，来与以色列人争战，好叫他们尽被杀灭，不蒙怜悯，正如耶和华所吩咐摩西的。
{Jos 11:21} And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction with their cities.
{Jos 11:21} 当时约书亚来到，将住山地、希伯仑、底璧、亚拿伯、犹大山地、以色列山地所有的亚衲族人剪除了。约书亚将他们和他们的城邑尽都毁灭。
{Jos 11:22} There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the people of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod did some remain.
{Jos 11:22} 在以色列人的地没有留下一个亚衲族人，只在迦萨、迦特，和亚实突有留下的。
{Jos 11:23} So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had spoken to Moses. And Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal allotments. And the land had rest from war.
{Jos 11:23} 这样，约书亚照着耶和华所吩咐摩西的一切话夺了那全地，就按着以色列支派的宗族将地分给他们为业。于是国中太平，没有争战了。
{Jos 12:1}  Now these are the kings of the land whom the people of Israel defeated and took possession of their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, with all the Arabah eastward:
{Jos 12:1}  以色列人在约但河外向日出之地击杀二王，得他们的地，就是从亚嫩谷直到黑门山，并东边的全亚拉巴之地。
{Jos 12:2}  Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from the middle of the valley as far as the river Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites, that is, half of Gilead,
{Jos 12:2}  这二王，有住希实本、亚摩利人的王西宏。他所管之地是从亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥和谷中的城，并基列一半，直到亚扪人的境界，雅博河
{Jos 12:3}  and the Arabah to the Sea of Chinneroth eastward, and in the direction of Beth-jeshimoth, to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, southward to the foot of the slopes of Pisgah;
{Jos 12:3}  与约但河东边的亚拉巴，直到基尼烈海，又到亚拉巴的海，就是盐海，通伯耶西末的路，以及南方，直到毗斯迦的山根。
{Jos 12:4}  and Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei
{Jos 12:4}  又有巴珊王噩。他是利乏音人所剩下的，住在亚斯他录和以得来。
{Jos 12:5}  and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and over half of Gilead to the boundary of Sihon king of Heshbon.
{Jos 12:5}  他所管之地是黑门山、撒迦、巴珊全地，直到基述人和玛迦人的境界，并基列一半，直到希实本王西宏的境界。
{Jos 12:6}  Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the people of Israel defeated them. And Moses the servant of the LORD gave their land for a possession to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
{Jos 12:6}  这二王是耶和华仆人摩西和以色列人所击杀的；耶和华仆人摩西将他们的地赐给流便人、迦得人，和玛拿西半支派的人为业。
{Jos 12:7}  And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the people of Israel defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir (and Joshua gave their land to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their allotments,
{Jos 12:7}  约书亚和以色列人在约但河西击杀了诸王。他们的地是从利巴嫩平原的巴力迦得，直到上西珥的哈拉山。约书亚就将那地按着以色列支派的宗族分给他们为业，
{Jos 12:8}  in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Arabah, in the slopes, in the wilderness, and in the Negeb, the land of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites):
{Jos 12:8}  就是赫人、亚摩利人，迦南人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的山地、高原亚拉巴、山坡、旷野，和南地。
{Jos 12:9}  the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;

{Jos 12:24} 一个是得撒王；共计三十一个王。
{Jos 13:1}  Now Joshua was old and advanced in years, and the LORD said to him, "You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to possess.
{Jos 13:1}  约书亚年纪老迈，耶和华对他说：“你年纪老迈了，还有许多未得之地，
{Jos 13:2}  This is the land that yet remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all those of the Geshurites
{Jos 13:2}  就是非利士人的全境和基述人的全地。
{Jos 13:3}  (from the Shihor, which is east of Egypt, northward to the boundary of Ekron, it is counted as Canaanite; there are five rulers of the Philistines, those of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron), and those of the Avvim,
{Jos 13:3}  从埃及前的西曷河往北，直到以革伦的境界，就算属迦南人之地。有非利士人五个首领所管的迦萨人、亚实突人、亚实基伦人、迦特人、以革伦人之地，并有南方亚卫人之地。
{Jos 13:4}  in the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the boundary of the Amorites,
{Jos 13:4}  又有迦南人的全地，并属西顿人的米亚拉到亚弗，直到亚摩利人的境界。
{Jos 13:5}  and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath,
{Jos 13:5}  还有迦巴勒人之地，并向日出的全利巴嫩，就是从黑门山根的巴力迦得，直到哈马口。
{Jos 13:6}  all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians. I myself will drive them out from before the people of Israel. Only allot the land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
{Jos 13:6}  山地的一切居民，从利巴嫩直到米斯利弗玛音，就是所有的西顿人，我必在以色列人面前赶出他们去。你只管照我所吩咐的，将这地拈阄分给以色列人为业。
{Jos 13:7}  Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh."
{Jos 13:7}  现在你要把这地分给九个支派和玛拿西半个支派为业。
{Jos 13:8}  With the other half of the tribe of Manasseh the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them:
{Jos 13:8}  玛拿西那半支派和流便、迦得二支派已经受了产业，就是耶和华的仆人摩西在约但河东所赐给他们的：
{Jos 13:9}  from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon;
{Jos 13:9}  是从亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥和谷中的城，并米底巴的全平原，直到底本，
{Jos 13:10} and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the boundary of the Ammonites;
{Jos 13:10} 和在希实本作王亚摩利王西宏的诸城，直到亚扪人的境界；
{Jos 13:11} and Gilead, and the region of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;
{Jos 13:11} 又有基列地、基述人、玛迦人的地界，并黑门全山、巴珊全地，直到撒迦；
{Jos 13:12} all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); these Moses had struck and driven out.
{Jos 13:12} 又有巴珊王噩的全国，他在亚斯他录和以得来作王（利乏音人所存留的只剩下他）。这些地的人都是摩西所击杀、所赶逐的。
{Jos 13:13} Yet the people of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites, but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.
{Jos 13:13} 以色列人却没有赶逐基述人、玛迦人；这些人仍住在以色列中，直到今日。
{Jos 13:14} To the tribe of Levi alone Moses gave no inheritance. The offerings by fire to the LORD God of Israel are their inheritance, as he said to him.
{Jos 13:14} 只是利未支派，摩西（原文作他）没有把产业分给他们。他们的产业乃是献与耶和华以色列神的火祭，正如耶和华所应许他们的。
{Jos 13:15} And Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the people of Reuben according to their clans.
{Jos 13:15} 摩西按着流便支派的宗族分给他们产业。
{Jos 13:16} So their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland by Medeba;
{Jos 13:16} 他们的境界是亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥和谷中的城，靠近米底巴的全平原；
{Jos 13:17} with Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the tableland; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
{Jos 13:17} 希实本并属希实本平原的各城，底本、巴末巴力、伯巴力勉、
{Jos 13:18} and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
{Jos 13:18} 雅杂、基底莫、米法押、
{Jos 13:19} and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley,
{Jos 13:19} 基列亭、西比玛、谷中山的细列哈沙辖、
{Jos 13:20} and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,
{Jos 13:20} 伯毗珥、毗斯迦山坡、伯耶西末；
{Jos 13:21} that is, all the cities of the tableland, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses defeated with the leaders of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
{Jos 13:21} 平原的各城，并亚摩利王西宏的全国。这西宏曾在希实本作王，摩西把他和米甸的族长以未、利金、苏珥、户珥、利巴击杀了；这都是住那地属西宏为首领的。
{Jos 13:22} Balaam also, the son of Beor, the one who practiced divination, was killed with the sword by the people of Israel among the rest of their slain.
{Jos 13:22} 那时以色列人在所杀的人中，也用刀杀了比珥的儿子术士巴兰。
{Jos 13:23} And the border of the people of Reuben was the Jordan as a boundary. This was the inheritance of the people of Reuben, according to their clans with their cities and villages.
{Jos 13:23} 流便人的境界就是约但河与靠近约但河的地。以上是流便人按着宗族所得为业的诸城，并属城的村庄。
{Jos 13:24} Moses gave an inheritance also to the tribe of Gad, to the people of Gad, according to their clans.
{Jos 13:24} 摩西按着迦得支派的宗族分给他们产业。
{Jos 13:25} Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites, to Aroer, which is east of Rabbah,
{Jos 13:25} 他们的境界是雅谢和基列的各城，并亚扪人的一半地，直到拉巴前的亚罗珥；
{Jos 13:26} and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir,
{Jos 13:26} 从希实本到拉抹米斯巴和比多宁，又从玛哈念到底璧的境界，
{Jos 13:27} and in the valley Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, having the Jordan as a boundary, to the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth, eastward beyond the Jordan.
{Jos 13:27} 并谷中的伯亚兰、伯宁拉、疏割、撒分，就是希实本王西宏国中的余地，以及约但河与靠近约但河的地，直到基尼烈海的极边，都在约但河东。
{Jos 13:28} This is the inheritance of the people of Gad according to their clans, with their cities and villages.
{Jos 13:28} 以上是迦得人按着宗族所得为业的诸城，并属城的村庄。
{Jos 13:29} And Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was allotted to the half-tribe of the people of Manasseh according to their clans.
{Jos 13:29} 摩西把产业分给玛拿西半支派，是按着玛拿西半支派的宗族所分的。
{Jos 13:30} Their region extended from Mahanaim, through all Bashan, the whole kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities,
{Jos 13:30} 他们的境界是从玛哈念起，包括巴珊全地，就是巴珊王噩的全国，并在巴珊、睚珥的一切城邑，共六十个。
{Jos 13:31} and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. These were allotted to the people of Machir the son of Manasseh for the half of the people of Machir according to their clans.
{Jos 13:31} 基列的一半，并亚斯他录、以得来，就是属巴珊王噩国的二城，是按着宗族给玛拿西的儿子玛吉的一半子孙。
{Jos 13:32} These are the inheritances that Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan east of Jericho.
{Jos 13:32} 以上是摩西在约但河东对着耶利哥的摩押平原所分给他们的产业。
{Jos 13:33} But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the LORD God of Israel is their inheritance, just as he said to them.
{Jos 13:33} 只是利未支派，摩西没有把产业分给他们。耶和华以色列的神是他们的产业，正如耶和华所应许他们的。
{Jos 14:1}  These are the inheritances that the people of Israel received in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel gave them to inherit.
{Jos 14:1}  以色列人在迦南地所得的产业，就是祭司以利亚撒和嫩的儿子约书亚，并以色列各支派的族长所分给他们的，都记在下面，
{Jos 14:2}  Their inheritance was by lot, just as the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine and one-half tribes.
{Jos 14:2}  是照耶和华藉摩西所吩咐的，把产业拈阄分给九个半支派。
{Jos 14:3}  For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
{Jos 14:3}  原来，摩西在约但河东已经把产业分给那两个半支派，只是在他们中间没有把产业分给利未人。
{Jos 14:4}  For the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance.
{Jos 14:4}  因为约瑟的子孙是两个支派，就是玛拿西和以法莲，所以没有把地分给利未人，但给他们城邑居住，并城邑的郊野，可以牧养他们的牲畜，安置他们的财物。
{Jos 14:5}  The people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses; they allotted the land.
{Jos 14:5}  耶和华怎样吩咐摩西，以色列人就照样行，把地分了。
{Jos 14:6}  Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me.
{Jos 14:6}  那时，犹大人来到吉甲见约书亚，有基尼洗族耶孚尼的儿子迦勒对约书亚说：“耶和华在加低斯巴尼亚指着我与你对神人摩西所说的话，你都知道了。
{Jos 14:7}  I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
{Jos 14:7}  耶和华的仆人摩西从加低斯巴尼亚打发我窥探这地，那时我正四十岁；我按着心意回报他。
{Jos 14:8}  But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the LORD my God.
{Jos 14:8}  然而，同我上去的众弟兄使百姓的心消化；但我专心跟从耶和华我的神。
{Jos 14:9}  And Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.'
{Jos 14:9}  当日摩西起誓说：‘你脚所踏之地定要归你和你的子孙永远为业，因为你专心跟从耶和华我的神。’
{Jos 14:10} And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, just as he said, these forty-five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old.
{Jos 14:10} 自从耶和华对摩西说这话的时候，耶和华照他所应许的使我存活这四十五年；其间以色列人在旷野行走。看哪，现今我八十五岁了，
{Jos 14:11} I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war and for going and coming.
{Jos 14:11} 我还是强壮，像摩西打发我去的那天一样；无论是争战，是出入，我的力量那时如何，现在还是如何。
{Jos 14:12} So now give me this hill country of which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day how the Anakim were there, with great fortified cities. It may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out just as the LORD said."
{Jos 14:12} 求你将耶和华那日应许我的这山地给我；那里有亚衲族人，并宽大坚固的城，你也曾听见了。或者耶和华照他所应许的与我同在，我就把他们赶出去。”
{Jos 14:13} Then Joshua blessed him, and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
{Jos 14:13} 于是约书亚为耶孚尼的儿子迦勒祝福，将希伯仑给他为业。
{Jos 14:14} Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel.
{Jos 14:14} 所以希伯仑作了基尼洗族耶孚尼的儿子迦勒的产业，直到今日，因为他专心跟从耶和华以色列的神。
{Jos 14:15} Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba. (Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.) And the land had rest from war.
{Jos 14:15} 希伯仑从前名叫基列亚巴；亚巴是亚衲族中最尊大的人。于是国中太平，没有争战了。
{Jos 15:1}  The allotment for the tribe of the people of Judah according to their clans reached southward to the boundary of Edom, to the wilderness of Zin at the farthest south.
{Jos 15:1}  犹大支派按着宗族拈阄所得之地是在尽南边，到以东的交界，向南直到寻的旷野。
{Jos 15:2}  And their south boundary ran from the end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.
{Jos 15:2}  他们的南界是从盐海的尽边，就是从朝南的海汊起，
{Jos 15:3}  It goes out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, passes along to Zin, and goes up south of Kadesh-barnea, along by Hezron, up to Addar, turns about to Karka,

{Jos 15:5}  东界是从盐海南边到约但河口。北界是从约但河口的海汊起，

{Jos 15:6}  上到伯曷拉，过伯亚拉巴的北边，上到流便之子波罕的磐石；
{Jos 15:7}  And the boundary goes up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and so northward, turning toward Gilgal, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley. And the boundary passes along to the waters of En-shemesh and ends at En-rogel.
{Jos 15:7}  从亚割谷往北，上到底璧，直向河南亚都冥坡对面的吉甲；又接连到隐示麦泉，直通到隐罗结，
{Jos 15:8}  Then the boundary goes up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the southern shoulder of the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem). And the boundary goes up to the top of the mountain that lies over against the Valley of Hinnom, on the west, at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
{Jos 15:8}  上到欣嫩子谷，贴近耶布斯的南界（耶布斯就是耶路撒冷）；又上到欣嫩谷西边的山顶，就是在利乏音谷极北的边界；
{Jos 15:9}  Then the boundary extends from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and from there to the cities of Mount Ephron. Then the boundary bends around to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim).
{Jos 15:9}  又从山顶延到尼弗多亚的水源，通到以弗仑山的城邑，又延到巴拉（巴拉就是基列耶琳）；
{Jos 15:10} And the boundary circles west of Baalah to Mount Seir, passes along to the northern shoulder of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), and goes down to Beth-shemesh and passes along by Timnah.
{Jos 15:10} 又从巴拉往西绕到西珥山，接连到耶琳山的北边（耶琳就是基撒仑）；又下到伯示麦过亭纳，

{Jos 15:12} And the west boundary was the Great Sea with its coastline. This is the boundary around the people of Judah according to their clans.
{Jos 15:12} 西界就是大海和靠近大海之地。这是犹大人按着宗族所得之地四围的交界。
{Jos 15:13} According to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the people of Judah, Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak).
{Jos 15:13} 约书亚照耶和华所吩咐的，将犹大人中的一段地，就是基列亚巴，分给耶孚尼的儿子迦勒。亚巴是亚衲族的始祖（基列亚巴就是希伯仑）。
{Jos 15:14} And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the descendants of Anak.
{Jos 15:14} 迦勒就从那里赶出亚衲族的三个族长，就是示筛、亚希幔、挞买；
{Jos 15:15} And he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir. Now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher.
{Jos 15:15} 又从那里上去，攻击底璧的居民。（这底璧从前名叫基列西弗。）
{Jos 15:16} And Caleb said, "Whoever strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife."
{Jos 15:16} 迦勒说：“谁能攻打基列西弗将城夺取，我就把我女儿押撒给他为妻。”
{Jos 15:17} And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
{Jos 15:17} 迦勒兄弟基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂夺取了那城，迦勒就把女儿押撒给他为妻。
{Jos 15:18} When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she got off her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"
{Jos 15:18} 押撒过门的时候，劝丈夫向他父亲求一块田，押撒一下驴，迦勒问他说：“你要什么？”
{Jos 15:19} She said to him, "Give me a blessing. Since you have given me the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water." And he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
{Jos 15:19} 他说：“求你赐福给我，你既将我安置在南地，求你也给我水泉。”他父亲就把上泉下泉赐给他。
{Jos 15:20} This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Judah according to their clans.

{Jos 16:1}  The allotment of the people of Joseph went from the Jordan by Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, into the wilderness, going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel.
{Jos 16:1}  约瑟的子孙拈阄所得之地是从靠近耶利哥的约但河起，以耶利哥东边的水为界：从耶利哥上去，通过山地的旷野，到伯特利；
{Jos 16:2}  Then going from Bethel to Luz, it passes along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites.
{Jos 16:2}  又从伯特利到路斯，接连到亚基人的境界，至亚他绿；
{Jos 16:3}  Then it goes down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and it ends at the sea.
{Jos 16:3}  又往西下到押利提人的境界，到下伯和仑的境界，直到基色，通到海为止。
{Jos 16:4}  The people of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.
{Jos 16:4}  约瑟的儿子玛拿西、以法莲就得了他们的地业。
{Jos 16:5}  The territory of the people of Ephraim by their clans was as follows: the boundary of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon,
{Jos 16:5}  以法莲子孙的境界，按着宗族所得的，记在下面：他们地业的东界是亚他绿亚达到上伯和仑；
{Jos 16:6}  and the boundary goes from there to the sea. On the north is Michmethath. Then on the east the boundary turns around toward Taanath-shiloh and passes along beyond it on the east to Janoah,
{Jos 16:6}  往西通到北边的密米他，又向东绕到他纳示罗，又接连到雅挪哈的东边；
{Jos 16:7}  then it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, and touches Jericho, ending at the Jordan.
{Jos 16:7}  从雅挪哈下到亚他绿，又到拿拉，达到耶利哥，通到约但河为止；
{Jos 16:8}  From Tappuah the boundary goes westward to the brook Kanah and ends at the sea. Such is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Ephraim by their clans,
{Jos 16:8}  从他普亚往西，到加拿河，直通到海为止。这就是以法莲支派按着宗族所得的地业。
{Jos 16:9}  together with the towns that were set apart for the people of Ephraim within the inheritance of the Manassites, all those towns with their villages.
{Jos 16:9}  另外在玛拿西人地业中得了些城邑和属城的村庄。这都是分给以法莲子孙的。
{Jos 16:10} However, they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites have lived in the midst of Ephraim to this day but have been made to do forced labor.
{Jos 16:10} 他们没有赶出住基色的迦南人；迦南人却住在以法莲人中间，成为做苦工的仆人，直到今日。
{Jos 17:1}  Then allotment was made to the people of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war.
{Jos 17:1}  玛拿西是约瑟的长子，他的支派拈阄所得之地记在下面。至于玛拿西的长子基列之父（或作：主）玛吉，因为是勇士就得了基列和巴珊。
{Jos 17:2}  And allotments were made to the rest of the people of Manasseh by their clans, Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph, by their clans.
{Jos 17:2}  玛拿西其余的子孙，按着宗族拈阄分地，就是亚比以谢子孙，希勒子孙，亚斯列子孙，示剑子孙，希弗子孙，示米大子孙；这些按着宗族，都是约瑟儿子玛拿西子孙的男丁。
{Jos 17:3}  Now Zelophehad the son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters, and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
{Jos 17:3}  玛拿西的玄孙，玛吉的曾孙，基列的孙子，希弗的儿子西罗非哈没有儿子，只有女儿。他的女儿名叫玛拉、挪阿、曷拉、密迦、得撒；
{Jos 17:4}  They approached Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the leaders and said, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance along with our brothers." So according to the mouth of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
{Jos 17:4}  他们来到祭司以利亚撒和嫩的儿子约书亚并众首领面前，说：“耶和华曾吩咐摩西在我们弟兄中分给我们产业。”于是约书亚照耶和华所吩咐的，在他们伯叔中，把产业分给他们。
{Jos 17:5}  Thus there fell to Manasseh ten portions, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side of the Jordan,
{Jos 17:5}  除了约但河东的基列和巴珊地之外，还有十分地归玛拿西，
{Jos 17:6}  because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons. The land of Gilead was allotted to the rest of the people of Manasseh.
{Jos 17:6}  因为玛拿西的孙女们在玛拿西的孙子中得了产业。基列地是属玛拿西其余的子孙。
{Jos 17:7}  The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath, which is east of Shechem. Then the boundary goes along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
{Jos 17:7}  玛拿西的境界：从亚设起，到示剑前的密米他，往北到隐他普亚居民之地。
{Jos 17:8}  The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to the people of Ephraim.
{Jos 17:8}  他普亚地归玛拿西，只是玛拿西境界上的他普亚城归以法莲子孙。
{Jos 17:9}  Then the boundary went down to the brook Kanah. These cities, to the south of the brook, among the cities of Manasseh, belong to Ephraim. Then the boundary of Manasseh goes on the north side of the brook and ends at the sea,
{Jos 17:9}  其界下到加拿河的南边。在玛拿西城邑中的这些城邑都归以法莲。玛拿西的地界是在河北直通到海为止；
{Jos 17:10} the land to the south being Ephraim's and that to the north being Manasseh's, with the sea forming its boundary. On the north Asher is reached, and on the east Issachar.
{Jos 17:10} 南归以法莲，北归玛拿西，以海为界；北边到亚设，东边到以萨迦。
{Jos 17:11} Also in Issachar and in Asher Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, and Ibleam and its villages, and the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; the third is Naphath.
{Jos 17:11} 玛拿西在以萨迦和亚设境内，有伯善和属伯善的镇市，以伯莲和属以伯莲的镇市，多珥的居民和属多珥的镇市；又有三处山冈，就是隐多珥和属隐多珥的镇市；他纳的居民和属他纳的镇市，米吉多的居民和属米吉多的镇市。
{Jos 17:12} Yet the people of Manasseh could not take possession of those cities, but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.
{Jos 17:12} 只是玛拿西子孙不能赶出这些城的居民，迦南人偏要住在那地。
{Jos 17:13} Now when the people of Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.
{Jos 17:13} 及至以色列人强盛了，就使迦南人做苦工，没有把他们全然赶出。
{Jos 17:14} Then the people of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given me but one lot and one portion as an inheritance, although I am a numerous people, since all along the LORD has blessed me?"
{Jos 17:14} 约瑟的子孙对约书亚说：“耶和华到如今既然赐福与我们，我们也族大人多，你为什么仅将一阄一段之地分给我们为业呢？”
{Jos 17:15} And Joshua said to them, "If you are a numerous people, go up by yourselves to the forest, and there clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you."
{Jos 17:15} 约书亚说：“你们如果族大人多，嫌以法莲山地窄小，就可以上比利洗人、利乏音人之地，在树林中砍伐树木。”
{Jos 17:16} The people of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us. Yet all the Canaanites who dwell in the plain have chariots of iron, both those in Beth-shean and its villages and those in the Valley of Jezreel."
{Jos 17:16} 约瑟的子孙说：“那山地容不下我们，并且住平原的迦南人，就是住伯善和属伯善的镇市，并住耶斯列平原的人，都有铁车。”
{Jos 17:17} Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, "You are a numerous people and have great power. You shall not have one allotment only,
{Jos 17:17} 约书亚对约瑟家，就是以法莲和玛拿西人，说：“你是族大人多，并且强盛，不可仅有一阄之地，
{Jos 17:18} but the hill country shall be yours, for though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders. For you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong."
{Jos 17:18} 山地也要归你，虽是树林，你也可以砍伐；靠近之地必归你。迦南人虽有铁车，虽是强盛，你也能把他们赶出去。”
{Jos 18:1}  Then the whole congregation of the people of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The land lay subdued before them.
{Jos 18:1}  以色列的全会众都聚集在示罗，把会幕设立在那里，那地已经被他们制伏了。
{Jos 18:2}  There remained among the people of Israel seven tribes whose inheritance had not yet been apportioned.
{Jos 18:2}  以色列人中其余的七个支派还没有分给他们地业。
{Jos 18:3}  So Joshua said to the people of Israel, "How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land, which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?
{Jos 18:3}  约书亚对以色列人说：“耶和华你们列祖的神所赐给你们的地，你们耽延不去得，要到几时呢？
{Jos 18:4}  Provide three men from each tribe, and I will send them out that they may set out and go up and down the land. They shall write a description of it with a view to their inheritances, and then come to me.
{Jos 18:4}  你们每支派当选举三个人，我要打发他们去，他们就要起身走遍那地，按着各支派应得的地业写明（或作：画图），就回到我这里来。
{Jos 18:5}  They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall continue in his territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall continue in their territory on the north.
{Jos 18:5}  他们要将地分做七分；犹大仍在南方，住在他的境内。约瑟家仍在北方，住在他的境内。
{Jos 18:6}  And you shall describe the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
{Jos 18:6}  你们要将地分做七分，写明了拿到我这里来。我要在耶和华我们神面前，为你们拈阄。
{Jos 18:7}  The Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of the LORD is their heritage. And Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them."
{Jos 18:7}  利未人在你们中间没有分，因为供耶和华祭司的职任就是他们的产业。迦得支派、流便支派，和玛拿西半支派已经在约但河东得了地业，就是耶和华仆人摩西所给他们的。”
{Jos 18:8}  So the men arose and went, and Joshua charged those who went to write the description of the land, saying, "Go up and down in the land and write a description and return to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh."
{Jos 18:8}  划地势的人起身去的时候，约书亚嘱咐他们说：“你们去走遍那地，划明地势，就回到我这里来。我要在示罗这里，耶和华面前，为你们拈阄。”
{Jos 18:9}  So the men went and passed up and down in the land and wrote in a book a description of it by towns in seven divisions. Then they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh,
{Jos 18:9}  他们就去了，走遍那地，按着城邑分做七分，写在册子上，回到示罗营中见约书亚。
{Jos 18:10} and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD. And there Joshua apportioned the land to the people of Israel, to each his portion.
{Jos 18:10} 约书亚就在示罗，耶和华面前，为他们拈阄。约书亚在那里，按着以色列人的支派，将地分给他们。
{Jos 18:11} The lot of the tribe of the people of Benjamin according to its clans came up, and the territory allotted to it fell between the people of Judah and the people of Joseph.
{Jos 18:11} 便雅悯支派，按着宗族拈阄所得之地，是在犹大、约瑟子孙中间。

{Jos 19:51} 这就是祭司以利亚撒和嫩的儿子约书亚，并以色列各支派的族长，在示罗会幕门口，耶和华面前，拈阄所分的地业。这样，他们把地分完了。
{Jos 20:1}  Then the LORD said to Joshua,
{Jos 20:1}  耶和华晓谕约书亚说：
{Jos 20:2}  "Say to the people of Israel, 'Appoint the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses,
{Jos 20:2}  “你吩咐以色列人说：你们要照着我藉摩西所晓谕你们的，为自己设立逃城，
{Jos 20:3}  that the manslayer who strikes any person without intent or unknowingly may flee there. They shall be for you a refuge from the avenger of blood.
{Jos 20:3}  使那无心而误杀人的，可以逃到那里。这些城可以作你们逃避报血仇人的地方。
{Jos 20:4}  He shall flee to one of these cities and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and explain his case to the elders of that city. Then they shall take him into the city and give him a place, and he shall remain with them.
{Jos 20:4}  那杀人的要逃到这些城中的一座城，站在城门口，将他的事情说给城内的长老们听。他们就把他收进城里，给他地方，使他住在他们中间。
{Jos 20:5}  And if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not give up the manslayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor unknowingly, and did not hate him in the past.
{Jos 20:5}  若是报血仇的追了他来，长老不可将他交在报血仇的手里；因为他是素无仇恨，无心杀了人的。
{Jos 20:6}  And he shall remain in that city until he has stood before the congregation for judgment, until the death of him who is high priest at the time. Then the manslayer may return to his own town and his own home, to the town from which he fled.'"
{Jos 20:6}  他要住在那城里，站在会众面前听审判，等到那时的大祭司死了，杀人的才可以回到本城本家，就是他所逃出来的那城。”
{Jos 20:7}  So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
{Jos 20:7}  于是，以色列人在拿弗他利山地分定加利利的基低斯；在以法莲山地分定示剑；在犹大山地分定基列亚巴（基列亚巴就是希伯仑）；
{Jos 20:8}  And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland, from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh.

{Jos 20:9}  这都是为以色列众人和在他们中间寄居的外人所分定的地邑，使误杀人的都可以逃到那里，不死在报血仇人的手中，等他站在会众面前听审判。
{Jos 21:1}  Then the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites came to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel.
{Jos 21:1}  那时，利未人的众族长来到祭司以利亚撒和嫩的儿子约书亚，并以色列各支派的族长面前，
{Jos 21:2}  And they said to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, "The LORD commanded through Moses that we be given cities to dwell in, along with their pasturelands for our livestock."
{Jos 21:2}  在迦南地的示罗对他们说：“从前耶和华藉着摩西吩咐给我们城邑居住，并城邑的郊野可以牧养我们的牲畜。”
{Jos 21:3}  So by command of the LORD the people of Israel gave to the Levites the following cities and pasturelands out of their inheritance.
{Jos 21:3}  于是以色列人照耶和华所吩咐的，从自己的地业中，将以下所记的城邑和城邑的郊野给了利未人。

{Jos 21:11} 将犹大山地的基列亚巴和四围的郊野给了他们。亚巴是亚衲族的始祖。（基列亚巴就是希伯仑）。

{Jos 21:12} 惟将属城的田地和村庄给了耶孚尼的儿子迦勒为业。

{Jos 21:29} Jarmuth with its pasturelands, En-gannim with its pasturelands--four cities;

{Jos 21:30} and out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its pasturelands, Abdon with its pasturelands,
{Jos 21:30} 又从亚设支派的地业中给了他们米沙勒和属城的郊野，押顿和属城的郊野，
{Jos 21:31} Helkath with its pasturelands, and Rehob with its pasturelands--four cities;
{Jos 21:31} 黑甲和属城的郊野，利合和属城的郊野，共四座城；
{Jos 21:32} and out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its pasturelands, the city of refuge for the manslayer, Hammoth-dor with its pasturelands, and Kartan with its pasturelands--three cities.
{Jos 21:32} 又从拿弗他利支派的地业中将加利利的基低斯，就是误杀人的逃城和属城的郊野，给了他们；又给他们哈末多珥和属城的郊野，加珥坦和属城的郊野，共三座城。
{Jos 21:33} The cities of the several clans of the Gershonites were in all thirteen cities with their pasturelands.
{Jos 21:33} 革顺人按着宗族所得的城，共十三座，还有属城的郊野。
{Jos 21:34} And to the rest of the Levites, the Merarite clans, were given out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its pasturelands, Kartah with its pasturelands,
{Jos 21:34} 其余利未支派米拉利子孙，从西布伦支派的地业中所得的，就是约念和属城的郊野，加珥他和属城的郊野，
{Jos 21:35} Dimnah with its pasturelands, Nahalal with its pasturelands--four cities;
{Jos 21:35} 丁拿和属城的郊野，拿哈拉和属城的郊野，共四座城；
{Jos 21:36} and out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its pasturelands, Jahaz with its pasturelands,
{Jos 21:36} 又从流便支派的地业中给了他们比悉和属城的郊野，雅杂和属城的郊野，
{Jos 21:37} Kedemoth with its pasturelands, and Mephaath with its pasturelands--four cities;
{Jos 21:37} 基底莫和属城的郊野，米法押和属城的郊野，共四座城；
{Jos 21:38} and out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its pasturelands, the city of refuge for the manslayer, Mahanaim with its pasturelands,
{Jos 21:38} 又从迦得支派的地业中，将基列的拉末，就是误杀人的逃城和属城的郊野，给了他们；又给他们玛哈念和属城的郊野，
{Jos 21:39} Heshbon with its pasturelands, Jazer with its pasturelands--four cities in all.
{Jos 21:39} 希实本和属城的郊野，雅谢和属城的郊野，共四座城。
{Jos 21:40} As for the cities of the several Merarite clans, that is, the remainder of the clans of the Levites, those allotted to them were in all twelve cities.
{Jos 21:40} 其余利未支派的人，就是米拉利的子孙，按着宗族拈阄所得的，共十二座城。
{Jos 21:41} The cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the people of Israel were in all forty-eight cities with their pasturelands.
{Jos 21:41} 利未人在以色列人的地业中所得的城，共四十八座，并有属城的郊野。
{Jos 21:42} These cities each had its pasturelands around it. So it was with all these cities.
{Jos 21:42} 这些城四围都有属城的郊野，城城都是如此。
{Jos 21:43} Thus the LORD gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their fathers. And they took possession of it, and they settled there.
{Jos 21:43} 这样，耶和华将从前向他们列祖起誓所应许的全地赐给以色列人，他们就得了为业，住在其中。
{Jos 21:44} And the LORD gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their fathers. Not one of all their enemies had withstood them, for the LORD had given all their enemies into their hands.
{Jos 21:44} 耶和华照着向他们列祖起誓所应许的一切话，使他们四境平安；他们一切仇敌中，没有一人在他们面前站立得住。耶和华把一切仇敌都交在他们手中。
{Jos 21:45} Not one word of all the good promises that the LORD had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass.
{Jos 21:45} 耶和华应许赐福给以色列家的话一句也没有落空，都应验了。
{Jos 22:1}  At that time Joshua summoned the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
{Jos 22:1}  当时，约书亚召了流便人、迦得人，和玛拿西半支派的人来，
{Jos 22:2}  and said to them, "You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that I have commanded you.
{Jos 22:2}  对他们说：“耶和华仆人摩西所吩咐你们的，你们都遵守了；我所吩咐你们的，你们也都听从了。
{Jos 22:3}  You have not forsaken your brothers these many days, down to this day, but have been careful to keep the charge of the LORD your God.
{Jos 22:3}  你们这许多日子，总没有撇离你们的弟兄，直到今日，并守了耶和华你们神所吩咐你们当守的。
{Jos 22:4}  And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as he promised them. Therefore turn and go to your tents in the land where your possession lies, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan.
{Jos 22:4}  如今耶和华你们神照着他所应许的，使你们弟兄得享平安，现在可以转回你们的帐棚，到耶和华的仆人摩西在约但河东所赐你们为业之地。
{Jos 22:5}  Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cling to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
{Jos 22:5}  只要切切的谨慎遵行耶和华仆人摩西所吩咐你们的诫命律法，爱耶和华你们的神，行他一切的道，守他的诫命，专靠他，尽心尽性事奉他。”
{Jos 22:6}  So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.
{Jos 22:6}  于是约书亚为他们祝福，打发他们去，他们就回自己的帐棚去了。
{Jos 22:7}  Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given a possession beside their brothers in the land west of the Jordan. And when Joshua sent them away to their homes and blessed them,
{Jos 22:7}  玛拿西那半支派，摩西早已在巴珊分给他们地业。这半支派，约书亚在约但河西，在他们弟兄中，分给他们地业。约书亚打发他们回帐棚的时候为他们祝福，
{Jos 22:8}  he said to them, "Go back to your tents with much wealth and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and with much clothing. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers."
{Jos 22:8}  对他们说：“你们带许多财物，许多牲畜和金、银、铜、铁，并许多衣服，回你们的帐棚去，要将你们从仇敌夺来的物，与你们众弟兄同分。”
{Jos 22:9}  So the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home, parting from the people of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, their own land of which they had possessed themselves by command of the LORD through Moses.
{Jos 22:9}  于是流便人、迦得人、玛拿西半支派的人从迦南地的示罗起行，离开以色列人，回往他们得为业的基列地，就是照耶和华藉摩西所吩咐的得了为业之地。
{Jos 22:10} And when they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of imposing size.
{Jos 22:10} 流便人、迦得人，和玛拿西半支派的人到了靠近约但河的一带迦南地，就在约但河那里筑了一座坛；那坛看着高大。
{Jos 22:11} And the people of Israel heard it said, "Behold, the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built the altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the people of Israel."
{Jos 22:11} 以色列人听说流便人、迦得人、玛拿西半支派的人靠近约但河边，在迦南地属以色列人的那边筑了一座坛。
{Jos 22:12} And when the people of Israel heard of it, the whole assembly of the people of Israel gathered at Shiloh to make war against them.
{Jos 22:12} 全会众一听见，就聚集在示罗，要上去攻打他们。
{Jos 22:13} Then the people of Israel sent to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
{Jos 22:13} 以色列人打发祭司以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈，往基列地去见流便人、迦得人、玛拿西半支派的人；
{Jos 22:14} and with him ten chiefs, one from each of the tribal families of Israel, every one of them the head of a family among the clans of Israel.
{Jos 22:14} 又打发十个首领与非尼哈同去，就是以色列每支派的一个首领，都是以色列军中的统领。
{Jos 22:15} And they came to the people of Reuben, the people of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them,
{Jos 22:15} 他们到了基列地，见流便人、迦得人，和玛拿西半支派的人，对他们说：
{Jos 22:16} "Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, 'What is this breach of faith that you have committed against the God of Israel in turning away this day from following the LORD by building yourselves an altar this day in rebellion against the LORD?
{Jos 22:16} “耶和华全会众这样说，你们今日转去不跟从耶和华，干犯以色列的神，为自己筑一座坛，悖逆了耶和华，这犯的是什么罪呢？
{Jos 22:17} Have we not had enough of the sin at Peor from which even yet we have not cleansed ourselves, and for which there came a plague upon the congregation of the LORD,
{Jos 22:17} 从前拜毗珥的罪孽还算小吗？虽然瘟疫临到耶和华的会众，到今日我们还没有洗净这罪。
{Jos 22:18} that you too must turn away this day from following the LORD? And if you too rebel against the LORD today then tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
{Jos 22:18} 你们今日竟转去不跟从耶和华吗？你们今日既悖逆耶和华，明日他必向以色列全会众发怒。
{Jos 22:19} But now, if the land of your possession is unclean, pass over into the LORD's land where the LORD's tabernacle stands, and take for yourselves a possession among us. Only do not rebel against the LORD or make us as rebels by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God.
{Jos 22:19} 你们所得为业之地，若嫌不洁净，就可以过到耶和华之地，就是耶和华的帐幕所住之地，在我们中间得地业。只是不可悖逆耶和华，也不可得罪我们，在耶和华我们神的坛以外为自己筑坛。
{Jos 22:20} Did not Achan the son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the devoted things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish alone for his iniquity.'"
{Jos 22:20} 从前谢拉的曾孙亚干岂不是在那当灭的物上犯了罪，就有忿怒临到以色列全会众吗？那人在所犯的罪中不独一人死亡。”
{Jos 22:21} Then the people of Reuben, the people of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel,
{Jos 22:21} 于是流便人、迦得人、玛拿西半支派的人回答以色列军中的统领说：
{Jos 22:22} "The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows; and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in breach of faith against the LORD, do not spare us today
{Jos 22:22} “大能者神耶和华！大能者神耶和华！他是知道的！以色列人也必知道！我们若有悖逆的意思，或是干犯耶和华（愿你今日不保佑我们），
{Jos 22:23} for building an altar to turn away from following the LORD. Or if we did so to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings on it, may the LORD himself take vengeance.
{Jos 22:23} 为自己筑坛，要转去不跟从耶和华，或是要将燔祭、素祭、平安祭献在坛上，愿耶和华亲自讨我们的罪。
{Jos 22:24} No, but we did it from fear that in time to come your children might say to our children, 'What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?
{Jos 22:24} 我们行这事并非无故，是特意做的，说：恐怕日后你们的子孙对我们的子孙说：‘你们与耶和华以色列的神有何关涉呢？
{Jos 22:25} For the LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you people of Reuben and people of Gad. You have no portion in the LORD.' So your children might make our children cease to worship the LORD.
{Jos 22:25} 因为耶和华把约但河定为我们和你们这流便人、迦得人的交界，你们与耶和华无分了。’这样，你们的子孙就使我们的子孙不再敬畏耶和华了。
{Jos 22:26} Therefore we said, 'Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice,
{Jos 22:26} 因此我们说：‘不如为自己筑一座坛，不是为献燔祭，也不是为献别的祭，
{Jos 22:27} but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we do perform the service of the LORD in his presence with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings, so your children will not say to our children in time to come, "You have no portion in the LORD."'
{Jos 22:27} 乃是为你我中间和你我后人中间作证据，好叫我们也在耶和华面前献燔祭、平安祭，和别的祭事奉他，免得你们的子孙日后对我们的子孙说，你们与耶和华无分了。’
{Jos 22:28} And we thought, 'If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we should say, "Behold, the copy of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you."'
{Jos 22:28} 所以我们说：‘日后你们对我们，或对我们的后人这样说，我们就可以回答说，你们看我们列祖所筑的坛是耶和华坛的样式；这并不是为献燔祭，也不是为献别的祭，乃是为作你我中间的证据。’
{Jos 22:29} Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away this day from following the LORD by building an altar for burnt offering, grain offering, or sacrifice, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle!"
{Jos 22:29} 我们在耶和华我们神帐幕前的坛以外，另筑一座坛，为献燔祭、素祭，和别的祭，悖逆耶和华，今日转去不跟从他，我们断没有这个意思。”
{Jos 22:30} When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation, the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh spoke, it was good in their eyes.
{Jos 22:30} 祭司非尼哈与会中的首领，就是与他同来以色列军中的统领，听见流便人、迦得人、玛拿西人所说的话，就都以为美。
{Jos 22:31} And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is in our midst, because you have not committed this breach of faith against the LORD. Now you have delivered the people of Israel from the hand of the LORD."
{Jos 22:31} 祭司以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈对流便人、迦得人、玛拿西人说：“今日我们知道耶和华在我们中间，因为你们没有向他犯了这罪。现在你们救以色列人脱离耶和华的手了。”
{Jos 22:32} Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the chiefs, returned from the people of Reuben and the people of Gad in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the people of Israel, and brought back word to them.
{Jos 22:32} 祭司以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈与众首领离了流便人、迦得人，从基列地回往迦南地，到了以色列人那里，便将这事回报他们。
{Jos 22:33} And the report was good in the eyes of the people of Israel. And the people of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them to destroy the land where the people of Reuben and the people of Gad were settled.
{Jos 22:33} 以色列人以这事为美，就称颂神，不再提上去攻打流便人、迦得人、毁坏他们所住的地了。
{Jos 22:34} The people of Reuben and the people of Gad called the altar Witness, "For," they said, "it is a witness between us that the LORD is God."
{Jos 22:34} 流便人、迦得人给坛起名叫证坛，意思说：这坛在我们中间证明耶和华是神。
{Jos 23:1}  A long time afterward, when the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years,
{Jos 23:1}  耶和华使以色列人安静，不与四围的一切仇敌争战，已经多日。约书亚年纪老迈，
{Jos 23:2}  Joshua summoned all Israel, its elders and heads, its judges and officers, and said to them, "I am now old and well advanced in years.
{Jos 23:2}  就把以色列众人的长老、族长、审判官，并官长都召了来，对他们说：“我年纪已经老迈。
{Jos 23:3}  And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for it is the LORD your God who has fought for you.
{Jos 23:3}  耶和华你们的神因你们的缘故向那些国所行的一切事，你们亲眼看见了，因那为你们争战的是耶和华你们的神。
{Jos 23:4}  Behold, I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have already cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west.
{Jos 23:4}  我所剪除和所剩下的各国，从约但河起到日落之处的大海，我已经拈阄分给你们各支派为业。
{Jos 23:5}  The LORD your God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight. And you shall possess their land, just as the LORD your God promised you.
{Jos 23:5}  耶和华你们的神必将他们从你们面前赶出去，使他们离开你们，你们就必得他们的地为业，正如耶和华你们的神所应许的。
{Jos 23:6}  Therefore, be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left,
{Jos 23:6}  所以，你们要大大壮胆，谨守遵行写在摩西律法书上的一切话，不可偏离左右。
{Jos 23:7}  that you may not mix with these nations remaining among you or make mention of the names of their gods or swear by them or serve them or bow down to them,
{Jos 23:7}  不可与你们中间所剩下的这些国民搀杂。他们的神，你们不可提他的名，不可指着他起誓，也不可事奉、叩拜；
{Jos 23:8}  but you shall cling to the LORD your God just as you have done to this day.
{Jos 23:8}  只要照着你们到今日所行的，专靠耶和华你们的神。
{Jos 23:9}  For the LORD has driven out before you great and strong nations. And as for you, no man has been able to stand before you to this day.
{Jos 23:9}  因为耶和华已经把又大又强的国民从你们面前赶出；直到今日，没有一人在你们面前站立得住。
{Jos 23:10} One man of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the LORD your God who fights for you, just as he promised you.
{Jos 23:10} 你们一人必追赶千人，因耶和华你们的神照他所应许的，为你们争战。
{Jos 23:11} Be very careful, therefore, to love the LORD your God.
{Jos 23:11} 你们要分外谨慎，爱耶和华你们的神。
{Jos 23:12} For if you turn back and cling to the remnant of these nations remaining among you and make marriages with them, so that you associate with them and they with you,
{Jos 23:12} 你们若稍微转去，与你们中间所剩下的这些国民联络，彼此结亲，互相往来，
{Jos 23:13} know for certain that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you, but they shall be a snare and a trap for you, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good ground that the LORD your God has given you.
{Jos 23:13} 你们要确实知道，耶和华你们的神必不再将他们从你们眼前赶出；他们却要成为你们的网罗、机槛、肋上的鞭、眼中的刺，直到你们在耶和华你们神所赐的这美地上灭亡。
{Jos 23:14} "And now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one word has failed of all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed.
{Jos 23:14} “我现在要走世人必走的路。你们是一心一意地知道，耶和华你们神所应许赐福与你们的话没有一句落空，都应验在你们身上了。
{Jos 23:15} But just as all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you, so the LORD will bring upon you all the evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this good land that the LORD your God has given you,
{Jos 23:15} 耶和华你们神所应许的一切福气怎样临到你们身上，耶和华也必照样使各样祸患临到你们身上，直到把你们从耶和华你们神所赐的这美地上除灭。
{Jos 23:16} if you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them. Then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land that he has given to you."
{Jos 23:16} 你们若违背耶和华你们神吩咐你们所守的约，去事奉别神，叩拜他，耶和华的怒气必向你们发作，使你们在他所赐的美地上速速灭亡。”
{Jos 24:1}  Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel. And they presented themselves before God.
{Jos 24:1}  约书亚将以色列的众支派聚集在示剑，召了以色列的长老、族长、审判官，并官长来，他们就站在神面前。
{Jos 24:2}  And Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Long ago, your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods.
{Jos 24:2}  约书亚对众民说：“耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘古时你们的列祖，就是亚伯拉罕和拿鹤的父亲他拉，住在大河那边事奉别神，
{Jos 24:3}  Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac.
{Jos 24:3}  我将你们的祖宗亚伯拉罕从大河那边带来，领他走遍迦南全地，又使他的子孙众多，把以撒赐给他；
{Jos 24:4}  And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.
{Jos 24:4}  又把雅各和以扫赐给以撒，将西珥山赐给以扫为业；后来雅各和他的子孙下到埃及去了。
{Jos 24:5}  And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it, and afterward I brought you out.
{Jos 24:5}  我差遣摩西、亚伦，并照我在埃及中所行的降灾与埃及，然后把你们领出来。
{Jos 24:6}  "'Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea. And the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
{Jos 24:6}  我领你们列祖出埃及，他们就到了红海；埃及人带领车辆马兵追赶你们列祖到红海。
{Jos 24:7}  And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness a long time.
{Jos 24:7}  你们列祖哀求耶和华，他就使你们和埃及人中间黑暗了，又使海水淹没埃及人。我在埃及所行的事，你们亲眼见过。你们在旷野也住了许多年日。
{Jos 24:8}  Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.
{Jos 24:8}  我领你们到约但河东亚摩利人所住之地。他们与你们争战，我将他们交在你们手中，你们便得了他们的地为业；我也在你们面前将他们灭绝。
{Jos 24:9}  Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and invited Balaam the son of Beor to curse you,
{Jos 24:9}  那时，摩押王西拨的儿子巴勒起来攻击以色列人，打发人召了比珥的儿子巴兰来咒诅你们。
{Jos 24:10} but I would not listen to Balaam. Indeed, he blessed you. So I delivered you out of his hand.
{Jos 24:10} 我不肯听巴兰的话，所以他倒为你们连连祝福。这样，我便救你们脱离巴勒的手。
{Jos 24:11} And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, and the leaders of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. And I gave them into your hand.
{Jos 24:11} 你们过了约但河，到了耶利哥；耶利哥人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、迦南人、赫人、革迦撒人、希未人、耶布斯人都与你们争战；我把他们交在你们手里。
{Jos 24:12} And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow.
{Jos 24:12} 我打发黄蜂飞在你们前面，将亚摩利人的二王从你们面前撵出，并不是用你的刀，也不是用你的弓。
{Jos 24:13} I gave you a land on which you had not labored and cities that you had not built, and you dwell in them. You eat the fruit of vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant.'
{Jos 24:13} 我赐给你们地土，非你们所修治的；我赐给你们城邑，非你们所建造的。你们就住在其中，又得吃非你们所栽种的葡萄园、橄榄园的果子。’
{Jos 24:14} "Now therefore fear the LORD and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
{Jos 24:14} “现在你们要敬畏耶和华，诚心实意地事奉他，将你们列祖在大河那边和在埃及所事奉的神除掉，去事奉耶和华。
{Jos 24:15} And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."
{Jos 24:15} 若是你们以事奉耶和华为不好，今日就可以选择所要事奉的：是你们列祖在大河那边所事奉的神呢？是你们所住这地的亚摩利人的神呢？至于我和我家，我们必定事奉耶和华。”
{Jos 24:16} Then the people answered, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods,
{Jos 24:16} 百姓回答说：“我们断不敢离弃耶和华去事奉别神；
{Jos 24:17} for it is the LORD our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed.
{Jos 24:17} 因耶和华我们的神曾将我们和我们列祖从埃及地的为奴之家领出来，在我们眼前行了那些大神迹，在我们所行的道上，所经过的诸国，都保护了我们。
{Jos 24:18} And the LORD drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God."
{Jos 24:18} 耶和华又把住此地的亚摩利人都从我们面前赶出去。所以，我们必事奉耶和华，因为他是我们的神。”
{Jos 24:19} But Joshua said to the people, "You are not able to serve the LORD, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.
{Jos 24:19} 约书亚对百姓说：“你们不能事奉耶和华；因为他是圣洁的神，是忌邪的神，必不赦免你们的过犯罪恶。
{Jos 24:20} If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm and consume you, after having done you good."
{Jos 24:20} 你们若离弃耶和华去事奉外邦神，耶和华在降福之后，必转而降祸与你们，把你们灭绝。”
{Jos 24:21} And the people said to Joshua, "No, but we will serve the LORD."
{Jos 24:21} 百姓回答约书亚说：“不然，我们定要事奉耶和华。”
{Jos 24:22} Then Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD, to serve him." And they said, "We are witnesses."
{Jos 24:22} 约书亚对百姓说：“你们选定耶和华，要事奉他，你们自己作见证吧！”他们说：“我们愿意作见证。”
{Jos 24:23} He said, "Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD, the God of Israel."
{Jos 24:23} 约书亚说：“你们现在要除掉你们中间的外邦神，专心归向耶和华以色列的神。”
{Jos 24:24} And the people said to Joshua, "The LORD our God we will serve, and his voice we will obey."
{Jos 24:24} 百姓回答约书亚说：“我们必事奉耶和华我们的神，听从他的话。”
{Jos 24:25} So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and put in place statutes and rules for them at Shechem.
{Jos 24:25} 当日，约书亚就与百姓立约，在示剑为他们立定律例典章。
{Jos 24:26} And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone and set it up there under the terebinth that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
{Jos 24:26} 约书亚将这些话都写在神的律法书上，又将一块大石头立在橡树下耶和华的圣所旁边。
{Jos 24:27} And Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD that he spoke to us. Therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God."
{Jos 24:27} 约书亚对百姓说：“看哪，这石头可以向我们作见证；因为是听见了耶和华所吩咐我们的一切话，倘或你们背弃你们的神，这石头就可以向你们作见证（倘或至见证：或作所以要向你们作见证，免得你们背弃耶和华你们的神）。”
{Jos 24:28} So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
{Jos 24:28} 于是约书亚打发百姓各归自己的地业去了。
{Jos 24:29} After these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being 110 years old.
{Jos 24:29} 这些事以后，耶和华的仆人嫩的儿子约书亚，正一百一十岁，就死了。
{Jos 24:30} And they buried him in his own inheritance at Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash.
{Jos 24:30} 以色列人将他葬在他地业的境内，就是在以法莲山地的亭拿西拉，在迦实山的北边。
{Jos 24:31} Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the work that the LORD did for Israel.
{Jos 24:31} 约书亚在世和约书亚死后，那些知道耶和华为以色列人所行诸事的长老还在的时候，以色列人事奉耶和华。
{Jos 24:32} As for the bones of Joseph, which the people of Israel brought up from Egypt, they buried them at Shechem, in the piece of land that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money. It became an inheritance of the descendants of Joseph.
{Jos 24:32} 以色列人从埃及所带来约瑟的骸骨，葬埋在示剑，就是在雅各从前用一百块银子向示剑的父亲、哈抹的子孙所买的那块地里；这就作了约瑟子孙的产业。
{Jos 24:33} And Eleazar the son of Aaron died, and they buried him at Gibeah, the town of Phinehas his son, which had been given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
{Jos 24:33} 亚伦的儿子以利亚撒也死了，就把他葬在他儿子非尼哈所得、以法莲山地的小山上。
