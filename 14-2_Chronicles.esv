{2Ch 1:1}   Solomon the son of David established himself in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.
{2Ch 1:1}   大卫的儿子所罗门国位坚固；耶和华他的神与他同在，使他甚为尊大。
{2Ch 1:2}   Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to all the leaders in all Israel, the heads of fathers' houses.
{2Ch 1:2}   所罗门吩咐以色列众人，就是千夫长、百夫长、审判官、首领与族长都来。
{2Ch 1:3}   And Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness, was there.
{2Ch 1:3}   所罗门和会众都往基遍的邱坛去，因那里有神的会幕，就是耶和华仆人摩西在旷野所制造的。
{2Ch 1:4}   (But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.)
{2Ch 1:4}   只是神的约柜，大卫已经从基列耶琳搬到他所预备的地方，因他曾在耶路撒冷为约柜支搭了帐幕，
{2Ch 1:5}   Moreover, the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the assembly sought it out.
{2Ch 1:5}   并且户珥的孙子、乌利的儿子比撒列所造的铜坛也在基遍耶和华的会幕前。所罗门和会众都就近坛前。
{2Ch 1:6}   And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
{2Ch 1:6}   所罗门上到耶和华面前会幕的铜坛那里，献一千牺牲为燔祭。
{2Ch 1:7}   In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, "Ask what I shall give you."
{2Ch 1:7}   当夜，神向所罗门显现，对他说：“你愿我赐你什么，你可以求。”
{2Ch 1:8}   And Solomon said to God, "You have shown great and steadfast love to David my father, and have made me king in his place.
{2Ch 1:8}   所罗门对神说：“你曾向我父大卫大施慈爱，使我接续他作王。
{2Ch 1:9}   O LORD God, let your word to David my father be now fulfilled, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.
{2Ch 1:9}   耶和华神啊，现在求你成就向我父大卫所应许的话；因你立我作这民的王，他们如同地上尘沙那样多。
{2Ch 1:10}  Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can govern this people of yours, which is so great?"
{2Ch 1:10}  求你赐我智慧聪明，我好在这民前出入；不然，谁能判断这众多的民呢？”
{2Ch 1:11}  God answered Solomon, "Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked for possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked for long life, but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may govern my people over whom I have made you king,
{2Ch 1:11}  神对所罗门说：“我已立你作我民的王。你既有这心意，并不求资财、丰富、尊荣，也不求灭绝那恨你之人的性命，又不求大寿数，只求智慧聪明好判断我的民；
{2Ch 1:12}  wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like."
{2Ch 1:12}  我必赐你智慧聪明，也必赐你资财、丰富、尊荣。在你以前的列王都没有这样，在你以后也必没有这样的。”
{2Ch 1:13}  So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.
{2Ch 1:13}  于是，所罗门从基遍邱坛会幕前回到耶路撒冷，治理以色列人。
{2Ch 1:14}  Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 1:14}  所罗门聚集战车马兵，有战车一千四百辆，马兵一万二千名，安置在屯车的城邑和耶路撒冷，就是王那里。
{2Ch 1:15}  And the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.
{2Ch 1:15}  王在耶路撒冷使金银多如石头，香柏木多如高原的桑树。
{2Ch 1:16}  And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's traders would buy them from Kue for a price.
{2Ch 1:16}  所罗门的马是从埃及带来的，是王的商人一群一群按着定价买来的。
{2Ch 1:17}  They imported a chariot from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver, and a horse for 150. Likewise through them these were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
{2Ch 1:17}  他们从埃及买来的车，每辆价银七百舍客勒，马每匹一百五十舍客勒。赫人诸王和亚兰诸王所买的车马，也是按这价值经他们手买来的。
{2Ch 2:1}   Now Solomon purposed to build a temple for the name of the LORD, and a royal palace for himself.
{2Ch 2:1}   所罗门定意要为耶和华的名建造殿宇，又为自己的国建造宫室。
{2Ch 2:2}   And Solomon assigned 70,000 men to bear burdens and 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 to oversee them.
{2Ch 2:2}   所罗门就挑选七万扛抬的，八万在山上凿石头的，三千六百督工的。
{2Ch 2:3}   And Solomon sent word to Hiram the king of Tyre: "As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedar to build himself a house to dwell in, so deal with me.
{2Ch 2:3}   所罗门差人去见推罗王希兰，说：“你曾运香柏木与我父大卫建宫居住，求你也这样待我。
{2Ch 2:4}   Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God and dedicate it to him for the burning of incense of sweet spices before him, and for the regular arrangement of the showbread, and for burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths and the new moons and the appointed feasts of the LORD our God, as ordained forever for Israel.
{2Ch 2:4}   我要为耶和华我神的名建造殿宇，分别为圣献给他，在他面前焚烧美香，常摆陈设饼，每早晚、安息日、月朔，并耶和华我们神所定的节期献燔祭。这是以色列人永远的定例。
{2Ch 2:5}   The house that I am to build will be great, for our God is greater than all gods.
{2Ch 2:5}   我所要建造的殿宇甚大；因为我们的神至大，超乎诸神。
{2Ch 2:6}   But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him?
{2Ch 2:6}   天和天上的天，尚且不足他居住的，谁能为他建造殿宇呢？我是谁？能为他建造殿宇吗？不过在他面前烧香而已。
{2Ch 2:7}   So now send me a man skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
{2Ch 2:7}   现在求你差一个巧匠来，就是善用金、银、铜、铁，和紫色、朱红色、蓝色线，并精于雕刻之工的巧匠，与我父大卫在犹大和耶路撒冷所预备的巧匠一同做工；
{2Ch 2:8}   Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And my servants will be with your servants,
{2Ch 2:8}   又求你从利巴嫩运些香柏木、松木、檀香木到我这里来，因我知道你的仆人善于砍伐利巴嫩的树木。我的仆人也必与你的仆人同工。
{2Ch 2:9}   to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am to build will be great and wonderful.
{2Ch 2:9}   这样，可以给我预备许多的木料，因我要建造的殿宇高大出奇。
{2Ch 2:10}  I will give for your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, 20,000 cors of crushed wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths of wine, and 20,000 baths of oil."
{2Ch 2:10}  你的仆人砍伐树木，我必给他们打好了的小麦二万歌珥，大麦二万歌珥，酒二万罢特，油二万罢特。”
{2Ch 2:11}  Then Hiram the king of Tyre answered in a letter that he sent to Solomon, "Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you king over them."
{2Ch 2:11}  推罗王希兰写信回答所罗门说：“耶和华因为爱他的子民，所以立你作他们的王”；
{2Ch 2:12}  Hiram also said, "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, who has discretion and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
{2Ch 2:12}  又说：“创造天地的耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的！他赐给大卫王一个有智慧的儿子，使他有谋略聪明，可以为耶和华建造殿宇，又为自己的国建造宫室。
{2Ch 2:13}  "Now I have sent a skilled man, who has understanding, Huram-abi,
{2Ch 2:13}  “现在我打发一个精巧有聪明的人去，他是我父亲希兰所用的，
{2Ch 2:14}  the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord, David your father.
{2Ch 2:14}  是但支派一个妇人的儿子。他父亲是推罗人，他善用金、银、铜、铁、石、木，和紫色、蓝色、朱红色线与细麻制造各物，并精于雕刻，又能想出各样的巧工。请你派定这人，与你的巧匠和你父我主大卫的巧匠一同做工。
{2Ch 2:15}  Now therefore the wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants.
{2Ch 2:15}  我主所说的小麦、大麦、酒、油，愿我主运来给众仆人。
{2Ch 2:16}  And we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem."
{2Ch 2:16}  我们必照你所需用的，从利巴嫩砍伐树木，扎成筏子，浮海运到约帕；你可以从那里运到耶路撒冷。”
{2Ch 2:17}  Then Solomon counted all the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, after the census of them that David his father had taken, and there were found 153,600.
{2Ch 2:17}  所罗门仿照他父大卫数点住在以色列地所有寄居的外邦人，共有十五万三千六百名；
{2Ch 2:18}  Seventy thousand of them he assigned to bear burdens, 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 as overseers to make the people work.
{2Ch 2:18}  使七万人扛抬材料，八万人在山上凿石头，三千六百人督理工作。
{2Ch 3:1}   Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
{2Ch 3:1}   所罗门就在耶路撒冷、耶和华向他父大卫显现的摩利亚山上，就是耶布斯人阿珥楠的禾场上、大卫所指定的地方预备好了，开工建造耶和华的殿。
{2Ch 3:2}   He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
{2Ch 3:2}   所罗门作王第四年二月初二日开工建造。
{2Ch 3:3}   These are Solomon's measurements for building the house of God: the length, in cubits of the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
{2Ch 3:3}   所罗门建筑神殿的根基，乃是这样：长六十肘，宽二十肘，都按着古时的尺寸。
{2Ch 3:4}   The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and its height was 120 cubits. He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold.
{2Ch 3:4}   殿前的廊子长二十肘，与殿的宽窄一样，高一百二十肘；里面贴上精金。
{2Ch 3:5}   The nave he lined with cypress and covered it with fine gold and made palms and chains on it.
{2Ch 3:5}   大殿的墙都用松木板遮蔽，又贴了精金，上面雕刻棕树和链子；
{2Ch 3:6}   He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold of Parvaim.
{2Ch 3:6}   又用宝石装饰殿墙，使殿华美；所用的金子都是巴瓦音的金子。
{2Ch 3:7}   So he lined the house with gold--its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors--and he carved cherubim on the walls.
{2Ch 3:7}   又用金子贴殿和殿的栋梁、门槛、墙壁、门扇；墙上雕刻基路伯。
{2Ch 3:8}   And he made the Most Holy Place. Its length, corresponding to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth was twenty cubits. He overlaid it with 600 talents of fine gold.
{2Ch 3:8}   又建造至圣所，长二十肘，与殿的宽窄一样，宽也是二十肘；贴上精金，共用金子六百他连得。
{2Ch 3:9}   The weight of gold for the nails was fifty shekels. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
{2Ch 3:9}   金钉重五十舍客勒。楼房都贴上金子。
{2Ch 3:10}  In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim of wood and overlaid them with gold.
{2Ch 3:10}  在至圣所按造像的法子造两个基路伯，用金子包裹。
{2Ch 3:11}  The wings of the cherubim together extended twenty cubits: one wing of the one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub;
{2Ch 3:11}  两个基路伯的翅膀共长二十肘。这基路伯的一个翅膀长五肘，挨着殿这边的墙；那一个翅膀也长五肘，与那基路伯翅膀相接。
{2Ch 3:12}  and of this cherub, one wing, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and the other wing, also of five cubits, was joined to the wing of the first cherub.
{2Ch 3:12}  那基路伯的一个翅膀长五肘，挨着殿那边的墙；那一个翅膀也长五肘，与这基路伯的翅膀相接。
{2Ch 3:13}  The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. The cherubim stood on their feet, facing the nave.
{2Ch 3:13}  两个基路伯张开翅膀，共长二十肘，面向外殿而立。
{2Ch 3:14}  And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it.
{2Ch 3:14}  又用蓝色、紫色、朱红色线和细麻织幔子，在其上绣出基路伯来。
{2Ch 3:15}  In front of the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with a capital of five cubits on the top of each.
{2Ch 3:15}  在殿前造了两根柱子，高三十五肘；每柱顶高五肘。
{2Ch 3:16}  He made chains like a necklace and put them on the tops of the pillars, and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains.
{2Ch 3:16}  又照圣所内链子的样式做链子，安在柱顶上；又做一百石榴，安在链子上。
{2Ch 3:17}  He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south, the other on the north; that on the south he called Jachin, and that on the north Boaz.
{2Ch 3:17}  将两根柱子立在殿前，一根在右边，一根在左边；右边的起名叫雅斤，左边的起名叫波阿斯。
{2Ch 4:1}   He made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.
{2Ch 4:1}   他又制造一座铜坛，长二十肘，宽二十肘，高十肘；
{2Ch 4:2}   Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.
{2Ch 4:2}   又铸一个铜海，样式是圆的，高五肘，径十肘，围三十肘；
{2Ch 4:3}   Under it were figures of gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.
{2Ch 4:3}   海周围有野瓜（野瓜：原文作牛）的样式，每肘十瓜，共有两行，是铸海的时候铸上的；
{2Ch 4:4}   It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward.
{2Ch 4:4}   有十二只铜牛驮海：三只向北，三只向西，三只向南，三只向东；海在牛上，牛尾向内；
{2Ch 4:5}   Its thickness was a handbreadth. And its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held 3,000 baths.
{2Ch 4:5}   海厚一掌，边如杯边，又如百合花，可容三千罢特；
{2Ch 4:6}   He also made ten basins in which to wash, and set five on the south side, and five on the north side. In these they were to rinse off what was used for the burnt offering, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.
{2Ch 4:6}   又制造十个盆：五个放在右边，五个放在左边，献燔祭所用之物都洗在其内；但海是为祭司沐浴的。
{2Ch 4:7}   And he made ten golden lampstands as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.
{2Ch 4:7}   他又照所定的样式造十个金灯台放在殿里：五个在右边，五个在左边；
{2Ch 4:8}   He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
{2Ch 4:8}   又造十张桌子放在殿里：五张在右边，五张在左边；又造一百个金碗；
{2Ch 4:9}   He made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid their doors with bronze.
{2Ch 4:9}   又建立祭司院和大院，并院门，用铜包裹门扇；
{2Ch 4:10}  And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.
{2Ch 4:10}  将海安在殿门的右边，就是南边。
{2Ch 4:11}  Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God:
{2Ch 4:11}  户兰又造了盆、铲、碗。这样，他为所罗门王做完了神殿的工。
{2Ch 4:12}  the two pillars, the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;
{2Ch 4:12}  所造的就是：两根柱子和柱上两个如球的顶，并两个盖柱顶的网子
{2Ch 4:13}  and the 400 pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.
{2Ch 4:13}  和四百石榴，安在两个网子上（每网两行盖着两个柱上如球的顶）。
{2Ch 4:14}  He made the stands also, and the basins on the stands,
{2Ch 4:14}  盆座和其上的盆，
{2Ch 4:15}  and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it.
{2Ch 4:15}  海和海下的十二只牛，
{2Ch 4:16}  The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the equipment for these Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 4:16}  盆、铲子、肉锸子，与耶和华殿里的一切器皿，都是巧匠户兰用光亮的铜为所罗门王造成的，
{2Ch 4:17}  In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
{2Ch 4:17}  是在约但平原疏割和撒利但中间藉胶泥铸成的。
{2Ch 4:18}  Solomon made all these things in great quantities, for the weight of the bronze was not sought.
{2Ch 4:18}  所罗门制造的这一切甚多，铜的轻重无法可查。
{2Ch 4:19}  So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence,
{2Ch 4:19}  所罗门又造神殿里的金坛和陈设饼的桌子，
{2Ch 4:20}  the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed;
{2Ch 4:20}  并精金的灯台和灯盏，可以照例点在内殿前。
{2Ch 4:21}  the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold;
{2Ch 4:21}  灯台上的花和灯盏，并蜡剪都是金的，且是纯金的；
{2Ch 4:22}  the snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold, and the sockets of the temple, for the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and for the doors of the nave of the temple were of gold.
{2Ch 4:22}  又用精金制造镊子、盘子、调羹、火鼎。至于殿门和至圣所的门扇，并殿的门扇，都是金子妆饰的。
{2Ch 5:1}   Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, and stored the silver, the gold, and all the vessels in the treasuries of the house of God.
{2Ch 5:1}   所罗门做完了耶和华殿的一切工，就把他父大卫分别为圣的金银和器皿都带来，放在神殿的府库里。
{2Ch 5:2}   Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel, in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
{2Ch 5:2}   那时，所罗门将以色列的长老、各支派的首领，并以色列的族长招聚到耶路撒冷，要把耶和华的约柜从大卫城就是锡安运上来。
{2Ch 5:3}   And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast that is in the seventh month.
{2Ch 5:3}   于是以色列众人在七月节前都聚集到王那里。
{2Ch 5:4}   And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.
{2Ch 5:4}   以色列众长老来到，利未人便抬起约柜。
{2Ch 5:5}   And they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the Levitical priests brought them up.
{2Ch 5:5}   祭司利未人将约柜运上来，又将会幕和会幕的一切圣器具都带上来。
{2Ch 5:6}   And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.
{2Ch 5:6}   所罗门王和聚集到他那里的以色列全会众都在约柜前献牛羊为祭，多得不可胜数。
{2Ch 5:7}   Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.
{2Ch 5:7}   祭司将耶和华的约柜抬进内殿，就是至圣所，放在两个基路伯的翅膀底下。
{2Ch 5:8}   The cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles.
{2Ch 5:8}   基路伯张着翅膀在约柜之上，遮掩约柜和抬柜的杠。
{2Ch 5:9}   And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.
{2Ch 5:9}   这杠甚长，杠头在内殿前可以看见，在殿外却不能看见，直到如今还在那里。
{2Ch 5:10}  There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
{2Ch 5:10}  约柜里惟有两块石版，就是以色列人出埃及后，耶和华与他们立约的时候，摩西在何烈山所放的。除此以外，并无别物。
{2Ch 5:11}  And when the priests came out of the Holy Place (for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves, without regard to their divisions,
{2Ch 5:11}  当时，在那里所有的祭司都已自洁，并不分班供职。
{2Ch 5:12}  and all the Levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, their sons and kinsmen, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, stood east of the altar with 120 priests who were trumpeters;
{2Ch 5:12}  他们出圣所的时候，歌唱的利未人亚萨、希幔、耶杜顿，和他们的众子众弟兄都穿细麻布衣服，站在坛的东边，敲钹、鼓瑟、弹琴，同着他们有一百二十个祭司吹号。
{2Ch 5:13}  and it was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the LORD), and when the song was raised, with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments, in praise to the LORD, "For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever," the house, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud,
{2Ch 5:13}  吹号的、歌唱的都一齐发声，声合为一，赞美感谢耶和华。吹号、敲钹，用各种乐器，扬声赞美耶和华说：耶和华本为善，他的慈爱永远长存！那时，耶和华的殿有云充满，
{2Ch 5:14}  so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
{2Ch 5:14}  甚至祭司不能站立供职，因为耶和华的荣光充满了神的殿。
{2Ch 6:1}   Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.
{2Ch 6:1}   那时，所罗门说：耶和华曾说他必住在幽暗之处。
{2Ch 6:2}   But I have built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever."
{2Ch 6:2}   但我已经建造殿宇作你的居所，为你永远的住处。
{2Ch 6:3}   Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.
{2Ch 6:3}   王转脸为以色列会众祝福，以色列会众就都站立。
{2Ch 6:4}   And he said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying,
{2Ch 6:4}   所罗门说：“耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的！因他亲口向我父大卫所应许的，也亲手成就了。
{2Ch 6:5}   'Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there, and I chose no man as prince over my people Israel;
{2Ch 6:5}   他说：‘自从我领我民出埃及地以来，我未曾在以色列众支派中选择一城建造殿宇为我名的居所，也未曾拣选一人作我民以色列的君；
{2Ch 6:6}   but I have chosen Jerusalem that my name may be there, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.'
{2Ch 6:6}   但选择耶路撒冷为我名的居所，又拣选大卫治理我民以色列。’”
{2Ch 6:7}   Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
{2Ch 6:7}   所罗门说：“我父大卫曾立意要为耶和华以色列神的名建殿，
{2Ch 6:8}   But the LORD said to David my father, 'Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.
{2Ch 6:8}   耶和华却对我父大卫说：‘你立意要为我的名建殿，这意思甚好；
{2Ch 6:9}   Nevertheless, it is not you who shall build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.'
{2Ch 6:9}   只是你不可建殿，惟你所生的儿子必为我名建殿。’
{2Ch 6:10}  Now the LORD has fulfilled his promise that he made. For I have risen in the place of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and I have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
{2Ch 6:10}  “现在耶和华成就了他所应许的话，使我接续我父大卫坐以色列的国位，是照耶和华所说的，又为耶和华以色列神的名建造了殿。
{2Ch 6:11}  And there I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with the people of Israel."
{2Ch 6:11}  我将约柜安置在其中，柜内有耶和华的约，就是他与以色列人所立的约。”
{2Ch 6:12}  Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
{2Ch 6:12}  所罗门当着以色列会众，站在耶和华的坛前，举起手来，
{2Ch 6:13}  Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the court, and he stood on it. Then he knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven,
{2Ch 6:13}  （所罗门曾造一个铜台，长五肘，宽五肘，高三肘，放在院中）就站在台上，当着以色列的会众跪下，向天举手，
{2Ch 6:14}  and said, "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart,
{2Ch 6:14}  说：“耶和华以色列的神啊，天上地下没有神可比你的！你向那尽心行在你面前的仆人守约施慈爱；
{2Ch 6:15}  who have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him. You spoke with your mouth, and with your hand have fulfilled it this day.
{2Ch 6:15}  向你仆人我父大卫所应许的话现在应验了。你亲口应许，亲手成就，正如今日一样。
{2Ch 6:16}  Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.'
{2Ch 6:16}  耶和华以色列的神啊，你所应许你仆人我父大卫的话说：‘你的子孙若谨慎自己的行为，遵守我的律法，像你在我面前所行的一样，就不断人坐以色列的国位。’现在求你应验这话。
{2Ch 6:17}  Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David.
{2Ch 6:17}  耶和华以色列的神啊，求你成就向你仆人大卫所应许的话。
{2Ch 6:18}  "But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this house that I have built!
{2Ch 6:18}  “神果真与世人同住在地上吗？看哪，天和天上的天尚且不足你居住的，何况我所建的这殿呢？
{2Ch 6:19}  Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O LORD my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you,
{2Ch 6:19}  惟求耶和华我的神垂顾仆人的祷告祈求，俯听仆人在你面前的祈祷呼吁。
{2Ch 6:20}  that your eyes may be open day and night toward this house, the place where you have promised to set your name, that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place.
{2Ch 6:20}  愿你昼夜看顾这殿，就是你应许立为你名的居所；求你垂听仆人向此处祷告的话。
{2Ch 6:21}  And listen to the pleas of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen from heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.
{2Ch 6:21}  你仆人和你民以色列向此处祈祷的时候，求你从天上你的居所垂听，垂听而赦免。
{2Ch 6:22}  "If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath and comes and swears his oath before your altar in this house,
{2Ch 6:22}  “人若得罪邻舍，有人叫他起誓，他来到这殿，在你的坛前起誓，
{2Ch 6:23}  then hear from heaven and act and judge your servants, repaying the guilty by bringing his conduct on his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
{2Ch 6:23}  求你从天上垂听，判断你的仆人，定恶人有罪，照他所行的报应在他头上；定义人有理，照他的义赏赐他。
{2Ch 6:24}  "If your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and they turn again and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this house,
{2Ch 6:24}  “你的民以色列若得罪你，败在仇敌面前，又回心转意承认你的名，在这殿里向你祈求祷告，
{2Ch 6:25}  then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave to them and to their fathers.
{2Ch 6:25}  求你从天上垂听，赦免你民以色列的罪，使他们归回你赐给他们和他们列祖之地。
{2Ch 6:26}  "When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you afflict them,
{2Ch 6:26}  “你的民因得罪你，你惩罚他们，使天闭塞不下雨，他们若向此处祷告，承认你的名，离开他们的罪，
{2Ch 6:27}  then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk, and grant rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.
{2Ch 6:27}  求你在天上垂听，赦免你仆人和你民以色列的罪，将当行的善道指教他们，且降雨在你的地，就是你赐给你民为业之地。
{2Ch 6:28}  "If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar, if their enemies besiege them in the land at their gates, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,
{2Ch 6:28}  “国中若有饥荒、瘟疫、旱风、霉烂、蝗虫、蚂蚱，或有仇敌犯境，围困城邑，无论遭遇什么灾祸疾病，
{2Ch 6:29}  whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing his own affliction and his own sorrow and stretching out his hands toward this house,
{2Ch 6:29}  你的民以色列，或是众人，或是一人，自觉灾祸甚苦，向这殿举手，无论祈求什么，祷告什么，
{2Ch 6:30}  then hear from heaven your dwelling place and forgive and render to each whose heart you know, according to all his ways, for you, you only, know the hearts of the children of mankind,
{2Ch 6:30}  求你从天上你的居所垂听赦免。你是知道人心的，要照各人所行的待他们（惟有你知道世人的心），
{2Ch 6:31}  that they may fear you and walk in your ways all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our fathers.
{2Ch 6:31}  使他们在你赐给我们列祖之地上一生一世敬畏你，遵行你的道。
{2Ch 6:32}  "Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a far country for the sake of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm, when he comes and prays toward this house,
{2Ch 6:32}  “论到不属你民以色列的外邦人，为你的大名和大能的手，并伸出来的膀臂，从远方而来，向这殿祷告，
{2Ch 6:33}  hear from heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house that I have built is called by your name.
{2Ch 6:33}  求你从天上你的居所垂听，照着外邦人所祈求的而行，使天下万民都认识你的名，敬畏你，像你的民以色列一样，又使他们知道我建造的这殿是称为你名下的。
{2Ch 6:34}  "If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,
{2Ch 6:34}  “你的民若奉你的差遣，无论往何处去与仇敌争战，向你所选择的城与我为你名所建造的殿祷告，
{2Ch 6:35}  then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.
{2Ch 6:35}  求你从天上垂听他们的祷告祈求，使他们得胜。
{2Ch 6:36}  "If they sin against you--for there is no one who does not sin--and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to a land far or near,
{2Ch 6:36}  “你的民若得罪你（世上没有不犯罪的人），你向他们发怒，将他们交给仇敌掳到或远或近之地；
{2Ch 6:37}  yet if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity, saying, 'We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly,'
{2Ch 6:37}  他们若在掳到之地想起罪来，回心转意，恳求你说：‘我们有罪了，我们悖逆了，我们作恶了’；
{2Ch 6:38}  if they repent with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity to which they were carried captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,
{2Ch 6:38}  他们若在掳到之地尽心尽性归服你，又向自己的地，就是你赐给他们列祖之地和你所选择的城，并我为你名所建造的殿祷告，
{2Ch 6:39}  then hear from heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their pleas, and maintain their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you.
{2Ch 6:39}  求你从天上你的居所垂听你民的祷告祈求，为他们伸冤，赦免他们的过犯。
{2Ch 6:40}  Now, O my God, let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayer of this place.
{2Ch 6:40}  “我的神啊，现在求你睁眼看，侧耳听在此处所献的祷告。
{2Ch 6:41}  "And now arise, O LORD God, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. Let your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in your goodness.
{2Ch 6:41}  耶和华神啊，求你起来，和你有能力的约柜同入安息之所。耶和华神啊，愿你的祭司披上救恩；愿你的圣民蒙福欢乐。
{2Ch 6:42}  O LORD God, do not turn away the face of your anointed one! Remember your steadfast love for David your servant."
{2Ch 6:42}  耶和华神啊，求你不要厌弃你的受膏者，要记念向你仆人大卫所施的慈爱。”
{2Ch 7:1}   As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
{2Ch 7:1}   所罗门祈祷已毕，就有火从天上降下来，烧尽燔祭和别的祭。耶和华的荣光充满了殿；
{2Ch 7:2}   And the priests could not enter the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD's house.
{2Ch 7:2}   因耶和华的荣光充满了耶和华殿，所以祭司不能进殿。
{2Ch 7:3}   When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the LORD on the temple, they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, "For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever."
{2Ch 7:3}   那火降下、耶和华的荣光在殿上的时候，以色列众人看见，就在铺石地俯伏叩拜，称谢耶和华说：耶和华本为善，他的慈爱永远长存！
{2Ch 7:4}   Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the LORD.
{2Ch 7:4}   王和众民在耶和华面前献祭。
{2Ch 7:5}   King Solomon offered as a sacrifice 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
{2Ch 7:5}   所罗门王用牛二万二千，羊十二万献祭。这样，王和众民为神的殿行奉献之礼。
{2Ch 7:6}   The priests stood at their posts; the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the LORD that King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD--for his steadfast love endures forever--whenever David offered praises by their ministry; opposite them the priests sounded trumpets, and all Israel stood.
{2Ch 7:6}   祭司侍立，各供其职；利未人也拿着耶和华的乐器，就是大卫王造出来、藉利未人颂赞耶和华的。（他的慈爱永远长存！）祭司在众人面前吹号，以色列人都站立。
{2Ch 7:7}   And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offering and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat.
{2Ch 7:7}   所罗门因他所造的铜坛容不下燔祭、素祭，和脂油，便将耶和华殿前院子当中分别为圣，在那里献燔祭和平安祭牲的脂油。
{2Ch 7:8}   At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt.
{2Ch 7:8}   那时所罗门和以色列众人，就是从哈马口直到埃及小河，所有的以色列人都聚集成为大会，守节七日。
{2Ch 7:9}   And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they had kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days.
{2Ch 7:9}   第八日设立严肃会，行奉献坛的礼七日，守节七日。
{2Ch 7:10}  On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the prosperity that the LORD had granted to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people.
{2Ch 7:10}  七月二十三日，王遣散众民；他们因见耶和华向大卫和所罗门与他民以色列所施的恩惠，就都心中喜乐，各归各家去了。
{2Ch 7:11}  Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king's house. All that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the LORD and in his own house he successfully accomplished.
{2Ch 7:11}  所罗门造成了耶和华殿和王宫；在耶和华殿和王宫凡他心中所要做的，都顺顺利利地做成了。
{2Ch 7:12}  Then the LORD appeared to Solomon in the night and said to him: "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.
{2Ch 7:12}  夜间耶和华向所罗门显现，对他说：“我已听了你的祷告，也选择这地方作为祭祀我的殿宇。
{2Ch 7:13}  When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people,
{2Ch 7:13}  我若使天闭塞不下雨，或使蝗虫吃这地的出产，或使瘟疫流行在我民中，
{2Ch 7:14}  if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.
{2Ch 7:14}  这称为我名下的子民，若是自卑、祷告，寻求我的面，转离他们的恶行，我必从天上垂听，赦免他们的罪，医治他们的地。
{2Ch 7:15}  Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.
{2Ch 7:15}  我必睁眼看、侧耳听在此处所献的祷告。
{2Ch 7:16}  For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.
{2Ch 7:16}  现在我已选择这殿，分别为圣，使我的名永在其中，我的眼、我的心也必常在那里。
{2Ch 7:17}  And as for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my rules,
{2Ch 7:17}  你若在我面前效法你父大卫所行的，遵行我一切所吩咐你的，谨守我的律例典章，
{2Ch 7:18}  then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to rule Israel.'
{2Ch 7:18}  我就必坚固你的国位，正如我与你父大卫所立的约，说：‘你的子孙必不断人作以色列的王。’
{2Ch 7:19}  "But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,
{2Ch 7:19}  “倘若你们转去丢弃我指示你们的律例诫命，去事奉敬拜别神，
{2Ch 7:20}  then I will pluck you up from my land that I have given you, and this house that I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
{2Ch 7:20}  我就必将以色列人从我赐给他们的地上拔出根来，并且我为己名所分别为圣的殿也必舍弃不顾，使他在万民中作笑谈，被讥诮。
{2Ch 7:21}  And at this house, which was exalted, everyone passing by will be astonished and say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?'
{2Ch 7:21}  这殿虽然甚高，将来经过的人必惊讶说：‘耶和华为何向这地和这殿如此行呢？’
{2Ch 7:22}  Then they will say, 'Because they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore he has brought all this disaster on them.'"
{2Ch 7:22}  人必回答说：‘是因此地的人离弃耶和华他们列祖的神，就是领他们出埃及地的神，去亲近别神，敬拜事奉他，所以耶和华使这一切灾祸临到他们。’”
{2Ch 8:1}   At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house,
{2Ch 8:1}   所罗门建造耶和华殿和王宫，二十年才完毕了。
{2Ch 8:2}   Solomon rebuilt the cities that Hiram had given to him, and settled the people of Israel in them.
{2Ch 8:2}   以后所罗门重新修筑希兰送给他的那些城邑，使以色列人住在那里。
{2Ch 8:3}   And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and took it.
{2Ch 8:3}   所罗门往哈马琐巴去，攻取了那地方。
{2Ch 8:4}   He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath.
{2Ch 8:4}   所罗门建造旷野里的达莫，又建造哈马所有的积货城，
{2Ch 8:5}   He also built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,
{2Ch 8:5}   又建造上伯和仑、下伯和仑作为保障，都有墙，有门，有闩；
{2Ch 8:6}   and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
{2Ch 8:6}   又建造巴拉和所有的积货城，并屯车辆马兵的城，与耶路撒冷、利巴嫩，以及自己治理的全国中所愿意建造的。
{2Ch 8:7}   All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,
{2Ch 8:7}   至于国中所剩下不属以色列人的赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人，
{2Ch 8:8}   from their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed--these Solomon drafted as forced labor, and so they are to this day.
{2Ch 8:8}   就是以色列人未曾灭绝的，所罗门挑取他们的后裔作服苦的奴仆，直到今日。
{2Ch 8:9}   But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.
{2Ch 8:9}   惟有以色列人，所罗门不使他们当奴仆做工，乃是作他的战士、军长的统领、车兵长、马兵长。
{2Ch 8:10}  And these were the chief officers of King Solomon, 250, who exercised authority over the people.
{2Ch 8:10}  所罗门王有二百五十督工的，监管工人。
{2Ch 8:11}  Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, "My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy."
{2Ch 8:11}  所罗门将法老的女儿带出大卫城，上到为他建造的宫里；因所罗门说：“耶和华约柜所到之处都为圣地，所以我的妻不可住在以色列王大卫的宫里。”
{2Ch 8:12}  Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD that he had built before the vestibule,
{2Ch 8:12}  所罗门在耶和华的坛上，就是在廊子前他所筑的坛上，与耶和华献燔祭；
{2Ch 8:13}  as the duty of each day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual feasts--the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths.
{2Ch 8:13}  又遵着摩西的吩咐在安息日、月朔，并一年三节，就是除酵节、七七节、住棚节，献每日所当献的祭。
{2Ch 8:14}  According to the ruling of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their offices of praise and ministry before the priests as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate, for so David the man of God had commanded.
{2Ch 8:14}  所罗门照着他父大卫所定的例，派定祭司的班次，使他们各供己事，又使利未人各尽其职，赞美耶和华，在祭司面前做每日所当做的；又派守门的按着班次看守各门，因为神人大卫是这样吩咐的。
{2Ch 8:15}  And they did not turn aside from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries.
{2Ch 8:15}  王所吩咐众祭司和利未人的，无论是管府库或办别的事，他们都不违背。
{2Ch 8:16}  Thus was accomplished all the work of Solomon from the day the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.
{2Ch 8:16}  所罗门建造耶和华的殿，从立根基直到成功的日子，工料俱备。这样，耶和华的殿全然完毕。
{2Ch 8:17}  Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Eloth on the shore of the sea, in the land of Edom.
{2Ch 8:17}  那时，所罗门往以东地靠海的以旬迦别和以禄去。
{2Ch 8:18}  And Hiram sent to him by the hand of his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea, and they went to Ophir together with the servants of Solomon and brought from there 450 talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon.
{2Ch 8:18}  希兰差遣他的臣仆，将船只和熟悉泛海的仆人送到所罗门那里。他们同着所罗门的仆人到了俄斐，得了四百五十他连得金子，运到所罗门王那里。
{2Ch 9:1}   Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions, having a very great retinue and camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.
{2Ch 9:1}   示巴女王听见所罗门的名声，就来到耶路撒冷，要用难解的话试问所罗门；跟随他的人甚多，又有骆驼驮着香料、宝石，和许多金子。他来见了所罗门，就把心里所有的对所罗门都说出来。
{2Ch 9:2}   And Solomon answered all her questions. There was nothing hidden from Solomon that he could not explain to her.
{2Ch 9:2}   所罗门将他所问的都答上了，没有一句不明白、不能答的。
{2Ch 9:3}   And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,
{2Ch 9:3}   示巴女王见所罗门的智慧和他所建造的宫室、
{2Ch 9:4}   the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, and their clothing, his cupbearers, and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more breath in her.
{2Ch 9:4}   席上的珍馐美味、群臣分列而坐、仆人两旁侍立，以及他们的衣服装饰、酒政，和酒政的衣服装饰，又见他上耶和华殿的台阶，就诧异得神不守舍，
{2Ch 9:5}   And she said to the king, "The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom,
{2Ch 9:5}   对王说：“我在本国里所听见论到你的事和你的智慧实在是真的！
{2Ch 9:6}   but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, half the greatness of your wisdom was not told me; you surpass the report that I heard.
{2Ch 9:6}   我先不信那些话，及至我来亲眼见了，才知道你的大智慧；人所告诉我的，还不到一半；你的实迹越过我所听见的名声。
{2Ch 9:7}   Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
{2Ch 9:7}   你的群臣、你的仆人常侍立在你面前听你智慧的话是有福的。
{2Ch 9:8}   Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on his throne as king for the LORD your God! Because your God loved Israel and would establish them forever, he has made you king over them, that you may execute justice and righteousness."
{2Ch 9:8}   耶和华你的神是应当称颂的！他喜悦你，使你坐他的国位，为耶和华你的神作王；因为你的神爱以色列人，要永远坚立他们，所以立你作他们的王，使你秉公行义。”
{2Ch 9:9}   Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
{2Ch 9:9}   于是示巴女王将一百二十他连得金子和宝石，与极多的香料送给所罗门王；他送给王的香料，以后再没有这样的。
{2Ch 9:10}  Moreover, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones.
{2Ch 9:10}  希兰的仆人和所罗门的仆人从俄斐运了金子来，也运了檀香木（或作：乌木；下同）和宝石来。
{2Ch 9:11}  And the king made from the algum wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king's house, lyres also and harps for the singers. There never was seen the like of them before in the land of Judah.
{2Ch 9:11}  王用檀香木为耶和华殿和王宫做台，又为歌唱的人做琴瑟；犹大地从来没有见过这样的。
{2Ch 9:12}  And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants.
{2Ch 9:12}  所罗门王按示巴女王所带来的，还他礼物，另外照他一切所要所求的，都送给他。于是女王和他臣仆转回本国去了。
{2Ch 9:13}  Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,
{2Ch 9:13}  所罗门每年所得的金子共有六百六十六他连得，
{2Ch 9:14}  besides that which the explorers and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.
{2Ch 9:14}  另外还有商人所进的金子，并且亚拉伯诸王与属国的省长都带金银给所罗门。
{2Ch 9:15}  King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of beaten gold went into each shield.
{2Ch 9:15}  所罗门王用锤出来的金子打成挡牌二百面，每面用金子六百舍客勒；
{2Ch 9:16}  And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; 300 shekels of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
{2Ch 9:16}  又用锤出来的金子打成盾牌三百面，每面用金子三百舍客勒，都放在利巴嫩林宫里。
{2Ch 9:17}  The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.
{2Ch 9:17}  王用象牙制造一个大宝座，用精金包裹。
{2Ch 9:18}  The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached to the throne, and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests,
{2Ch 9:18}  宝座有六层台阶，又有金脚凳，与宝座相连。宝座两旁有扶手，靠近扶手有两个狮子站立。
{2Ch 9:19}  while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any kingdom.
{2Ch 9:19}  六层台阶上有十二个狮子站立，每层有两个：左边一个，右边一个；在列国中没有这样做的。
{2Ch 9:20}  All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.
{2Ch 9:20}  所罗门王一切的饮器都是金的，利巴嫩林宫里的一切器皿都是精金的。所罗门年间，银子算不了什么。
{2Ch 9:21}  For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
{2Ch 9:21}  因为王的船只与希兰的仆人一同往他施去；他施船只三年一次装载金、银、象牙、猿猴、孔雀回来。
{2Ch 9:22}  Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
{2Ch 9:22}  所罗门王的财宝与智慧胜过天下的列王。
{2Ch 9:23}  And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.
{2Ch 9:23}  普天下的王都求见所罗门，要听神赐给他智慧的话。
{2Ch 9:24}  Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and of gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
{2Ch 9:24}  他们各带贡物，就是金器、银器、衣服、军械、香料、骡马，每年有一定之例。
{2Ch 9:25}  And Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 9:25}  所罗门有套车的马四千棚，有马兵一万二千，安置在屯车的城邑和耶路撒冷，就是王那里。
{2Ch 9:26}  And he ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt.
{2Ch 9:26}  所罗门统管诸王，从大河到非利士地，直到埃及的边界。
{2Ch 9:27}  And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.
{2Ch 9:27}  王在耶路撒冷使银子多如石头，香柏木多如高原的桑树。
{2Ch 9:28}  And horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.
{2Ch 9:28}  有人从埃及和各国为所罗门赶马群来。
{2Ch 9:29}  Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
{2Ch 9:29}  所罗门其余的事，自始至终，不都写在先知拿单的书上和示罗人亚希雅的预言书上，并先见易多论尼八儿子耶罗波安的默示书上吗？
{2Ch 9:30}  Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
{2Ch 9:30}  所罗门在耶路撒冷作以色列众人的王共四十年。
{2Ch 9:31}  And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
{2Ch 9:31}  所罗门与他列祖同睡，葬在他父大卫城里。他儿子罗波安接续他作王。
{2Ch 10:1}  Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
{2Ch 10:1}  罗波安往示剑去，因为以色列人都到了示剑，要立他作王。
{2Ch 10:2}  And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
{2Ch 10:2}  尼八的儿子耶罗波安先前躲避所罗门王，逃往埃及，住在那里；他听见这事，就从埃及回来。
{2Ch 10:3}  And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam,
{2Ch 10:3}  以色列人打发人去请他，他就和以色列众人来见罗波安，对他说：
{2Ch 10:4}  "Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you."
{2Ch 10:4}  “你父亲使我们负重轭做苦工，现在求你使我们做的苦工负的重轭轻松些，我们就事奉你。”
{2Ch 10:5}  He said to them, "Come to me again in three days." So the people went away.
{2Ch 10:5}  罗波安对他们说：“第三日再来见我吧！”民就去了。
{2Ch 10:6}  Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, "How do you advise me to answer this people?"
{2Ch 10:6}  罗波安之父所罗门在世的日子，有侍立在他面前的老年人，罗波安王和他们商议，说：“你们给我出个什么主意，我好回覆这民。”
{2Ch 10:7}  And they said to him, "If you will be good to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever."
{2Ch 10:7}  老年人对他说：“王若恩待这民，使他们喜悦，用好话回覆他们，他们就永远作王的仆人。”
{2Ch 10:8}  But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.
{2Ch 10:8}  王却不用老年人给他出的主意，就和那些与他一同长大、在他面前侍立的少年人商议，
{2Ch 10:9}  And he said to them, "What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?"
{2Ch 10:9}  说：“这民对我说：‘你父亲使我们负重轭，求你使我们轻松些’；你们给我出个什么主意，我好回覆他们。”
{2Ch 10:10} And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, "Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us'; thus shall you say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs.
{2Ch 10:10} 那同他长大的少年人说：“这民对王说：‘你父亲使我们负重轭，求你使我们轻松些’；王要对他们如此说：‘我的小拇指比我父亲的腰还粗；
{2Ch 10:11} And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'"
{2Ch 10:11} 我父亲使你们负重轭，我必使你们负更重的轭；我父亲用鞭子责打你们，我要用蝎子鞭责打你们。’”
{2Ch 10:12} So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, "Come to me again the third day."
{2Ch 10:12} 耶罗波安和众百姓遵着罗波安王所说“你们第三日再来见我”的那话，第三日他们果然来了。
{2Ch 10:13} And the king answered them harshly; and forsaking the counsel of the old men,
{2Ch 10:13} 罗波安王用严厉的话回覆他们，不用老年人所出的主意，
{2Ch 10:14} King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."
{2Ch 10:14} 照着少年人所出的主意对他们说：“我父亲使你们负重轭，我必使你们负更重的轭；我父亲用鞭子责打你们，我要用蝎子鞭责打你们。”
{2Ch 10:15} So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the LORD might fulfill his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
{2Ch 10:15} 王不肯依从百姓；这事乃出于神，为要应验耶和华藉示罗人亚希雅对尼八儿子耶罗波安所说的话。
{2Ch 10:16} And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, "What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each of you to your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David." So all Israel went to their tents.
{2Ch 10:16} 以色列众民见王不依从他们，就对王说：我们与大卫有什么分儿呢？与耶西的儿子并没有关涉！以色列人哪，各回各家去吧！大卫家啊，自己顾自己吧！于是，以色列众人都回自己家里去了。
{2Ch 10:17} But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.
{2Ch 10:17} 惟独住在犹大城邑的以色列人，罗波安仍作他们的王。
{2Ch 10:18} Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and the people of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam quickly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
{2Ch 10:18} 罗波安王差遣掌管服苦之人的哈多兰往以色列人那里去，以色列人就用石头打死他。罗波安王急忙上车，逃回耶路撒冷去了。
{2Ch 10:19} So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
{2Ch 10:19} 这样，以色列人背叛大卫家，直到今日。
{2Ch 11:1}  When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
{2Ch 11:1}  罗波安来到耶路撒冷，招聚犹大家和便雅悯家，共十八万人，都是挑选的战士，要与以色列人争战，好将国夺回再归自己。
{2Ch 11:2}  But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God:
{2Ch 11:2}  但耶和华的话临到神人示玛雅说：
{2Ch 11:3}  "Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
{2Ch 11:3}  “你去告诉所罗门的儿子犹大王罗波安和住犹大、便雅悯的以色列众人说，
{2Ch 11:4}  'Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives. Return every man to his home, for this thing is from me.'" So they listened to the word of the LORD and returned and did not go against Jeroboam.
{2Ch 11:4}  耶和华如此说：‘你们不可上去与你们的弟兄争战，各归各家去吧！因为这事出于我。’”众人就听从耶和华的话归回，不去与耶罗波安争战。
{2Ch 11:5}  Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built cities for defense in Judah.
{2Ch 11:5}  罗波安住在耶路撒冷，在犹大地修筑城邑，
{2Ch 11:6}  He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
{2Ch 11:6}  为保障修筑伯利恒、以坦、提哥亚、
{2Ch 11:7}  Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,
{2Ch 11:7}  伯夙、梭哥、亚杜兰、
{2Ch 11:8}  Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
{2Ch 11:8}  迦特、玛利沙、西弗、
{2Ch 11:9}  Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
{2Ch 11:9}  亚多莱音、拉吉、亚西加、
{2Ch 11:10} Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that are in Judah and in Benjamin.
{2Ch 11:10} 琐拉、亚雅仑、希伯仑。这都是犹大和便雅悯的坚固城。
{2Ch 11:11} He made the fortresses strong, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine.
{2Ch 11:11} 罗波安又坚固各处的保障，在其中安置军长，又预备下粮食、油、酒。
{2Ch 11:12} And he put shields and spears in all the cities and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.
{2Ch 11:12} 他在各城里预备盾牌和枪，且使城极其坚固。犹大和便雅悯都归了他。
{2Ch 11:13} And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves to him from all places where they lived.
{2Ch 11:13} 以色列全地的祭司和利未人都从四方来归罗波安。
{2Ch 11:14} For the Levites left their common lands and their holdings and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons cast them out from serving as priests of the LORD,
{2Ch 11:14} 利未人撇下他们的郊野和产业，来到犹大与耶路撒冷，是因耶罗波安和他的儿子拒绝他们，不许他们供祭司职分事奉耶和华。
{2Ch 11:15} and he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for the calves that he had made.
{2Ch 11:15} 耶罗波安为邱坛、为鬼魔（原文作公山羊）、为自己所铸造的牛犊设立祭司。
{2Ch 11:16} And those who had set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came after them from all the tribes of Israel to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
{2Ch 11:16} 以色列各支派中，凡立定心意寻求耶和华以色列神的，都随从利未人，来到耶路撒冷祭祀耶和华他们列祖的神。
{2Ch 11:17} They strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they made Rehoboam the son of Solomon secure, for they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.
{2Ch 11:17} 这样，就坚固犹大国，使所罗门的儿子罗波安强盛三年，因为他们三年遵行大卫和所罗门的道。
{2Ch 11:18} Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse,
{2Ch 11:18} 罗波安娶大卫儿子耶利摩的女儿玛哈拉为妻，又娶耶西儿子以利押的女儿亚比孩为妻。
{2Ch 11:19} and she bore him sons, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
{2Ch 11:19} 从他生了几个儿子，就是耶乌施、示玛利雅、撒罕。
{2Ch 11:20} After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
{2Ch 11:20} 后来又娶押沙龙的女儿玛迦（十三章二节是乌列的女儿米该雅），从他生了亚比雅、亚太、细撒、示罗密。
{2Ch 11:21} Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and concubines (he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters).
{2Ch 11:21} 罗波安娶十八个妻，立六十个妾，生二十八个儿子，六十个女儿；他却爱押沙龙的女儿玛迦，比爱别的妻妾更甚。
{2Ch 11:22} And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king.
{2Ch 11:22} 罗波安立玛迦的儿子亚比雅作太子，在他弟兄中为首，因为想要立他接续作王。
{2Ch 11:23} And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the districts of Judah and Benjamin, in all the fortified cities, and he gave them abundant provisions and procured wives for them.
{2Ch 11:23} 罗波安办事精明，使他众子分散在犹大和便雅悯全地各坚固城里，又赐他们许多粮食，为他们多寻妻子。
{2Ch 12:1}  When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
{2Ch 12:1}  罗波安的国坚立，他强盛的时候就离弃耶和华的律法，以色列人也都随从他。
{2Ch 12:2}  In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
{2Ch 12:2}  罗波安王第五年，埃及王示撒上来攻打耶路撒冷，因为王和民得罪了耶和华。
{2Ch 12:3}  with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him from Egypt--Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians.
{2Ch 12:3}  示撒带战车一千二百辆，马兵六万，并且跟从他出埃及的路比人、苏基人，和古实人，多得不可胜数。
{2Ch 12:4}  And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
{2Ch 12:4}  他攻取了犹大的坚固城，就来到耶路撒冷。
{2Ch 12:5}  Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, "Thus says the LORD, 'You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.'"
{2Ch 12:5}  那时，犹大的首领因为示撒就聚集在耶路撒冷。有先知示玛雅去见罗波安和众首领，对他们说：“耶和华如此说：‘你们离弃了我，所以我使你们落在示撒手里。’”
{2Ch 12:6}  Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is righteous."
{2Ch 12:6}  于是王和以色列的众首领都自卑说：“耶和华是公义的。”
{2Ch 12:7}  When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah: "They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
{2Ch 12:7}  耶和华见他们自卑，耶和华的话就临到示玛雅说：“他们既自卑，我必不灭绝他们；必使他们略得拯救，我不藉着示撒的手将我的怒气倒在耶路撒冷。
{2Ch 12:8}  Nevertheless, they shall be servants to him, that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."
{2Ch 12:8}  然而他们必作示撒的仆人，好叫他们知道，服事我与服事外邦人有何分别。”
{2Ch 12:9}  So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house. He took away everything. He also took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made,
{2Ch 12:9}  于是，埃及王示撒上来攻取耶路撒冷，夺了耶和华殿和王宫里的宝物，尽都带走，又夺去所罗门制造的金盾牌。
{2Ch 12:10} and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.
{2Ch 12:10} 罗波安王制造铜盾牌代替那金盾牌，交给守王宫门的护卫长看守。
{2Ch 12:11} And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard came and carried them and brought them back to the guardroom.
{2Ch 12:11} 王每逢进耶和华的殿，护卫兵就拿这盾牌，随后仍将盾牌送回，放在护卫房。
{2Ch 12:12} And when he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to make a complete destruction. Moreover, conditions were good in Judah.
{2Ch 12:12} 王自卑的时候，耶和华的怒气就转消了，不将他灭尽，并且在犹大中间也有善益的事。
{2Ch 12:13} So King Rehoboam grew strong in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
{2Ch 12:13} 罗波安王自强，在耶路撒冷作王。他登基的时候年四十一岁，在耶路撒冷，就是耶和华从以色列众支派中所选择立他名的城，作王十七年。罗波安的母亲名叫拿玛，是亚扪人。
{2Ch 12:14} And he did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek the LORD.
{2Ch 12:14} 罗波安行恶，因他不立定心意寻求耶和华。
{2Ch 12:15} Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the chronicles of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer? There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
{2Ch 12:15} 罗波安所行的事，自始至终不都写在先知示玛雅和先见易多的史记上吗？罗波安与耶罗波安时常争战。
{2Ch 12:16} And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, and Abijah his son reigned in his place.
{2Ch 12:16} 罗波安与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城里。他儿子亚比雅接续他作王。
{2Ch 13:1}  In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.
{2Ch 13:1}  耶罗波安王十八年，亚比雅登基作犹大王，
{2Ch 13:2}  He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
{2Ch 13:2}  在耶路撒冷作王三年。他母亲名叫米该亚（又作玛迦），是基比亚人乌列的女儿。亚比雅常与耶罗波安争战。
{2Ch 13:3}  Abijah went out to battle, having an army of valiant men of war, 400,000 chosen men. And Jeroboam drew up his line of battle against him with 800,000 chosen mighty warriors.
{2Ch 13:3}  有一次亚比雅率领挑选的兵四十万摆阵，都是勇敢的战士；耶罗波安也挑选大能的勇士八十万，对亚比雅摆阵。
{2Ch 13:4}  Then Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim that is in the hill country of Ephraim and said, "Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel!
{2Ch 13:4}  亚比雅站在以法莲山地中的洗玛脸山上，说：“耶罗波安和以色列众人哪，要听我说！
{2Ch 13:5}  Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt?
{2Ch 13:5}  耶和华以色列的神曾立盐约（盐就是不废坏的意思），将以色列国永远赐给大卫和他的子孙，你们不知道吗？
{2Ch 13:6}  Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord,
{2Ch 13:6}  无奈大卫儿子所罗门的臣仆、尼八儿子耶罗波安起来背叛他的主人。
{2Ch 13:7}  and certain worthless scoundrels gathered about him and defied Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and irresolute and could not withstand them.
{2Ch 13:7}  有些无赖的匪徒聚集跟从他，逞强攻击所罗门的儿子罗波安；那时罗波安还幼弱，不能抵挡他们。
{2Ch 13:8}  "And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David, because you are a great multitude and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods.
{2Ch 13:8}  “现在你们有意抗拒大卫子孙手下所治耶和华的国，你们的人也甚多，你们那里又有耶罗波安为你们所造当作神的金牛犊。
{2Ch 13:9}  Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes for ordination with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what are not gods.
{2Ch 13:9}  你们不是驱逐耶和华的祭司亚伦的后裔和利未人吗？不是照着外邦人的恶俗为自己立祭司吗？无论何人牵一只公牛犊、七只公绵羊将自己分别出来，就可作虚无之神的祭司。
{2Ch 13:10} But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests ministering to the LORD who are sons of Aaron, and Levites for their service.
{2Ch 13:10} 至于我们，耶和华是我们的神，我们并没有离弃他。我们有事奉耶和华的祭司，都是亚伦的后裔，并有利未人各尽其职，
{2Ch 13:11} They offer to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt offerings and incense of sweet spices, set out the showbread on the table of pure gold, and care for the golden lampstand that its lamps may burn every evening. For we keep the charge of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken him.
{2Ch 13:11} 每日早晚向耶和华献燔祭，烧美香，又在精金的桌子上摆陈设饼；又有金灯台和灯盏，每晚点起，因为我们遵守耶和华我们神的命；惟有你们离弃了他。
{2Ch 13:12} Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you cannot succeed."
{2Ch 13:12} 率领我们的是神，我们这里也有神的祭司拿号向你们吹出大声。以色列人哪，不要与耶和华你们列祖的神争战，因你们必不能亨通。”
{2Ch 13:13} Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to come upon them from behind. Thus his troops were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
{2Ch 13:13} 耶罗波安却在犹大人的后头设伏兵。这样，以色列人在犹大人的前头，伏兵在犹大人的后头。
{2Ch 13:14} And when Judah looked, behold, the battle was in front of and behind them. And they cried to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets.
{2Ch 13:14} 犹大人回头观看，见前后都有敌兵，就呼求耶和华，祭司也吹号。
{2Ch 13:15} Then the men of Judah raised the battle shout. And when the men of Judah shouted, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
{2Ch 13:15} 于是犹大人呐喊；犹大人呐喊的时候，神就使耶罗波安和以色列众人败在亚比雅与犹大人面前。
{2Ch 13:16} The men of Israel fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hand.
{2Ch 13:16} 以色列人在犹大人面前逃跑，神将他们交在犹大人手里。
{2Ch 13:17} Abijah and his people struck them with great force, so there fell slain of Israel 500,000 chosen men.
{2Ch 13:17} 亚比雅和他的军兵大大杀戮以色列人，以色列人仆倒死亡的精兵有五十万。
{2Ch 13:18} Thus the men of Israel were subdued at that time, and the men of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers.
{2Ch 13:18} 那时，以色列人被制伏了，犹大人得胜，是因倚靠耶和华他们列祖的神。
{2Ch 13:19} And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages and Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron with its villages.
{2Ch 13:19} 亚比雅追赶耶罗波安，攻取了他的几座城，就是伯特利和属伯特利的镇市，耶沙拿和属耶沙拿的镇市，以法拉音（或作：以弗伦）和属以法拉音的镇市。
{2Ch 13:20} Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah. And the LORD struck him down, and he died.
{2Ch 13:20} 亚比雅在世的时候，耶罗波安不能再强盛；耶和华攻击他，他就死了。
{2Ch 13:21} But Abijah grew mighty. And he took fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
{2Ch 13:21} 亚比雅却渐渐强盛，娶妻妾十四个，生了二十二个儿子，十六个女儿。
{2Ch 13:22} The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
{2Ch 13:22} 亚比雅其余的事和他的言行都写在先知易多的传上。
{2Ch 14:1}  Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land had rest for ten years.
{2Ch 14:1}  亚比雅与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城里。他儿子亚撒接续他作王。亚撒年间，国中太平十年。
{2Ch 14:2}  And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
{2Ch 14:2}  亚撒行耶和华他神眼中看为善为正的事，
{2Ch 14:3}  He took away the foreign altars and the high places and broke down the pillars and cut down the Asherim
{2Ch 14:3}  除掉外邦神的坛和邱坛，打碎柱像，砍下木偶，
{2Ch 14:4}  and commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to keep the law and the commandment.
{2Ch 14:4}  吩咐犹大人寻求耶和华他们列祖的神，遵行他的律法、诫命；
{2Ch 14:5}  He also took out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars. And the kingdom had rest under him.
{2Ch 14:5}  又在犹大各城邑除掉邱坛和日像，那时国享太平；
{2Ch 14:6}  He built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest. He had no war in those years, for the LORD gave him peace.
{2Ch 14:6}  又在犹大建造了几座坚固城。国中太平数年，没有战争，因为耶和华赐他平安。
{2Ch 14:7}  And he said to Judah, "Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought him, and he has given us peace on every side." So they built and prospered.
{2Ch 14:7}  他对犹大人说：“我们要建造这些城邑，四围筑墙，盖楼，安门，做闩；地还属我们，是因寻求耶和华我们的神；我们既寻求他，他就赐我们四境平安。”于是建造城邑，诸事亨通。
{2Ch 14:8}  And Asa had an army of 300,000 from Judah, armed with large shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin that carried shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor.
{2Ch 14:8}  亚撒的军兵，出自犹大拿盾牌拿枪的三十万人；出自便雅悯拿盾牌拉弓的二十八万人。这都是大能的勇士。
{2Ch 14:9}  Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and came as far as Mareshah.
{2Ch 14:9}  有古实王谢拉率领军兵一百万，战车三百辆，出来攻击犹大人，到了玛利沙。
{2Ch 14:10} And Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up their lines of battle in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
{2Ch 14:10} 于是亚撒出去与他迎敌，就在玛利沙的洗法谷彼此摆阵。
{2Ch 14:11} And Asa cried to the LORD his God, "O LORD, there is none like you to help, between the mighty and the weak. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let not man prevail against you."
{2Ch 14:11} 亚撒呼求耶和华他的神说：“耶和华啊，惟有你能帮助软弱的，胜过强盛的。耶和华我们的神啊，求你帮助我们；因为我们仰赖你，奉你的名来攻击这大军。耶和华啊，你是我们的神，不要容人胜过你。”
{2Ch 14:12} So the LORD defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.
{2Ch 14:12} 于是耶和华使古实人败在亚撒和犹大人面前，古实人就逃跑了；
{2Ch 14:13} Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians fell until none remained alive, for they were broken before the LORD and his army. The men of Judah carried away very much spoil.
{2Ch 14:13} 亚撒和跟随他的军兵追赶他们，直到基拉耳。古实人被杀的甚多，不能再强盛，因为败在耶和华与他军兵面前。犹大人就夺了许多财物，
{2Ch 14:14} And they attacked all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the LORD was upon them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them.
{2Ch 14:14} 又打破基拉耳四围的城邑；耶和华使其中的人都甚恐惧。犹大人又将所有的城掳掠一空，因其中的财物甚多，
{2Ch 14:15} And they struck down the tents of those who had livestock and carried away sheep in abundance and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
{2Ch 14:15} 又毁坏了群畜的圈，夺取许多的羊和骆驼，就回耶路撒冷去了。
{2Ch 15:1}  The Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded,
{2Ch 15:1}  神的灵感动俄德的儿子亚撒利雅。
{2Ch 15:2}  and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, "Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The LORD is with you while you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.
{2Ch 15:2}  他出来迎接亚撒，对他说：“亚撒和犹大、便雅悯众人哪，要听我说：你们若顺从耶和华，耶和华必与你们同在；你们若寻求他，就必寻见；你们若离弃他，他必离弃你们。
{2Ch 15:3}  For a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without law,
{2Ch 15:3}  以色列人不信真神，没有训诲的祭司，也没有律法，已经好久了；
{2Ch 15:4}  but when in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.
{2Ch 15:4}  但他们在急难的时候归向耶和华以色列的神，寻求他，他就被他们寻见。
{2Ch 15:5}  In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands.
{2Ch 15:5}  那时，出入的人不得平安，列国的居民都遭大乱；
{2Ch 15:6}  They were broken in pieces. Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every sort of distress.
{2Ch 15:6}  这国攻击那国，这城攻击那城，互相破坏，因为神用各样灾难扰乱他们。
{2Ch 15:7}  But you, take courage! Do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded."
{2Ch 15:7}  现在你们要刚强，不要手软，因你们所行的必得赏赐。”
{2Ch 15:8}  As soon as Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Azariah the son of Oded, he took courage and put away the detestable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim, and he repaired the altar of the LORD that was in front of the vestibule of the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 15:8}  亚撒听见这话和俄德儿子先知亚撒利雅的预言，就壮起胆来，在犹大、便雅悯全地，并以法莲山地所夺的各城，将可憎之物尽都除掉，又在耶和华殿的廊前重新修筑耶和华的坛；
{2Ch 15:9}  And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were residing with them, for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
{2Ch 15:9}  又招聚犹大、便雅悯的众人，并他们中间寄居的以法莲人、玛拿西人、西缅人。有许多以色列人归降亚撒，因见耶和华他的神与他同在。
{2Ch 15:10} They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
{2Ch 15:10} 亚撒十五年三月，他们都聚集在耶路撒冷。
{2Ch 15:11} They sacrificed to the LORD on that day from the spoil that they had brought 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep.
{2Ch 15:11} 当日他们从所取的掳物中，将牛七百只、羊七千只献给耶和华。
{2Ch 15:12} And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul,
{2Ch 15:12} 他们就立约，要尽心尽性地寻求耶和华他们列祖的神。
{2Ch 15:13} but that whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman.
{2Ch 15:13} 凡不寻求耶和华以色列神的，无论大小、男女，必被治死。
{2Ch 15:14} They swore an oath to the LORD with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with horns.
{2Ch 15:14} 他们就大声欢呼，吹号吹角，向耶和华起誓。
{2Ch 15:15} And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and had sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and the LORD gave them rest all around.
{2Ch 15:15} 犹大众人为所起的誓欢喜；因他们是尽心起誓，尽意寻求耶和华，耶和华就被他们寻见，且赐他们四境平安。
{2Ch 15:16} Even Maacah, his mother, King Asa removed from being queen mother because she had made a detestable image for Asherah. Asa cut down her image, crushed it, and burned it at the brook Kidron.
{2Ch 15:16} 亚撒王贬了他祖母玛迦太后的位，因他造了可憎的偶像亚舍拉。亚撒砍下他的偶像，捣得粉碎，烧在汲沦溪边。
{2Ch 15:17} But the high places were not taken out of Israel. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was wholly true all his days.
{2Ch 15:17} 只是邱坛还没有从以色列中废去，然而亚撒的心一生诚实。
{2Ch 15:18} And he brought into the house of God the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels.
{2Ch 15:18} 亚撒将他父所分别为圣、与自己所分别为圣的金银和器皿都奉到神的殿里。
{2Ch 15:19} And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
{2Ch 15:19} 从这时直到亚撒三十五年，都没有争战的事。
{2Ch 16:1}  In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
{2Ch 16:1}  亚撒三十六年，以色列王巴沙上来攻击犹大，修筑拉玛，不许人从犹大王亚撒那里出入。
{2Ch 16:2}  Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the LORD and the king's house and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,
{2Ch 16:2}  于是亚撒从耶和华殿和王宫的府库里拿出金银来，送与住大马色的亚兰王便哈达，说：
{2Ch 16:3}  "There is a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me."
{2Ch 16:3}  “你父曾与我父立约，我与你也要立约。现在我将金银送给你，求你废掉你与以色列王巴沙所立的约，使他离开我。”
{2Ch 16:4}  And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
{2Ch 16:4}  便哈达听从亚撒王的话，派军长去攻击以色列的城邑。他们就攻破以云、但、亚伯玛音，和拿弗他利一切的积货城。
{2Ch 16:5}  And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and let his work cease.
{2Ch 16:5}  巴沙听见就停工，不修筑拉玛了。
{2Ch 16:6}  Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.
{2Ch 16:6}  于是亚撒王率领犹大众人，将巴沙修筑拉玛所用的石头、木头都运去，用以修筑迦巴和米斯巴。
{2Ch 16:7}  At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, "Because you relied on the king of Syria, and did not rely on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped you.
{2Ch 16:7}  那时，先见哈拿尼来见犹大王亚撒，对他说：“因你仰赖亚兰王，没有仰赖耶和华你的神，所以亚兰王的军兵脱离了你的手。
{2Ch 16:8}  Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, he gave them into your hand.
{2Ch 16:8}  古实人、路比人的军队不是甚大吗？战车马兵不是极多吗？只因你仰赖耶和华，他便将他们交在你手里。
{2Ch 16:9}  For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose heart is blameless toward him. You have done foolishly in this, for from now on you will have wars."
{2Ch 16:9}  耶和华的眼目遍察全地，要显大能帮助向他心存诚实的人。你这事行得愚昧；此后，你必有争战的事。”
{2Ch 16:10} Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the stocks in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time.
{2Ch 16:10} 亚撒因此恼恨先见，将他囚在监里。那时亚撒也虐待一些人民。
{2Ch 16:11} The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
{2Ch 16:11} 亚撒所行的事，自始至终都写在犹大和以色列诸王记上。
{2Ch 16:12} In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe. Yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but sought help from physicians.
{2Ch 16:12} 亚撒作王三十九年，他脚上有病，而且甚重。病的时候没有求耶和华，只求医生。
{2Ch 16:13} And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign.
{2Ch 16:13} 他作王四十一年而死，与他列祖同睡，
{2Ch 16:14} They buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer's art, and they made a very great fire in his honor.
{2Ch 16:14} 葬在大卫城自己所凿的坟墓里，放在床上，其床堆满各样馨香的香料，就是按做香的作法调和的香料，又为他烧了许多的物件。
{2Ch 17:1}  Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place and strengthened himself against Israel.
{2Ch 17:1}  亚撒的儿子约沙法接续他作王，奋勇自强，防备以色列人，
{2Ch 17:2}  He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured.
{2Ch 17:2}  安置军兵在犹大一切坚固城里，又安置防兵在犹大地和他父亚撒所得以法莲的城邑中。
{2Ch 17:3}  The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals,
{2Ch 17:3}  耶和华与约沙法同在；因为他行他祖大卫初行的道，不寻求巴力，
{2Ch 17:4}  but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments, and not according to the practices of Israel.
{2Ch 17:4}  只寻求他父亲的神，遵行他的诫命，不效法以色列人的行为。
{2Ch 17:5}  Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor.
{2Ch 17:5}  所以耶和华坚定他的国，犹大众人给他进贡；约沙法大有尊荣资财。
{2Ch 17:6}  His heart was courageous in the ways of the LORD. And furthermore, he took the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.
{2Ch 17:6}  他高兴遵行耶和华的道，并且从犹大除掉一切邱坛和木偶。
{2Ch 17:7}  In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;
{2Ch 17:7}  他作王第三年，就差遣臣子便亥伊勒、俄巴底、撒迦利雅、拿坦业、米该亚往犹大各城去教训百姓。
{2Ch 17:8}  and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and with these Levites, the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
{2Ch 17:8}  同着他们有利未人示玛雅、尼探雅、西巴第雅、亚撒黑、示米拉末、约拿单、亚多尼雅、多比雅、驼巴多尼雅，又有祭司以利沙玛、约兰同着他们。
{2Ch 17:9}  And they taught in Judah, having the Book of the Law of the LORD with them. They went about through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.
{2Ch 17:9}  他们带着耶和华的律法书，走遍犹大各城教训百姓。
{2Ch 17:10} And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, and they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
{2Ch 17:10} 耶和华使犹大四围的列国都甚恐惧，不敢与约沙法争战。
{2Ch 17:11} Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute, and the Arabians also brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats.
{2Ch 17:11} 有些非利士人与约沙法送礼物，纳贡银。亚拉伯人也送他公绵羊七千七百只，公山羊七千七百只。
{2Ch 17:12} And Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater. He built in Judah fortresses and store cities,
{2Ch 17:12} 约沙法日渐强大，在犹大建造营寨和积货城。
{2Ch 17:13} and he had large supplies in the cities of Judah. He had soldiers, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 17:13} 他在犹大城邑中有许多工程，又在耶路撒冷有战士，就是大能的勇士。
{2Ch 17:14} This was the muster of them by fathers' houses: Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 mighty men of valor;
{2Ch 17:14} 他们的数目，按着宗族，记在下面：犹大族的，千夫长押拿为首率领大能的勇士三十万；
{2Ch 17:15} and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;
{2Ch 17:15} 其次是，千夫长约哈难率领大能的勇士二十八万；
{2Ch 17:16} and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, a volunteer for the service of the LORD, with 200,000 mighty men of valor.
{2Ch 17:16} 其次是，细基利的儿子亚玛斯雅（他为耶和华牺牲自己）率领大能的勇士二十万。
{2Ch 17:17} Of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, with 200,000 men armed with bow and shield;
{2Ch 17:17} 便雅悯族，是大能的勇士以利雅大率领，拿弓箭和盾牌的二十万；
{2Ch 17:18} and next to him Jehozabad with 180,000 armed for war.
{2Ch 17:18} 其次是，约萨拔率领预备打仗的十八万。
{2Ch 17:19} These were in the service of the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
{2Ch 17:19} 这都是伺候王的，还有王在犹大全地坚固城所安置的不在其内。
{2Ch 18:1}  Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor, and he made a marriage alliance with Ahab.
{2Ch 18:1}  约沙法大有尊荣资财，就与亚哈结亲。
{2Ch 18:2}  After some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab killed an abundance of sheep and oxen for him and for the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead.
{2Ch 18:2}  过了几年，他下到撒玛利亚去见亚哈；亚哈为他和跟从他的人宰了许多牛羊，劝他与自己同去攻取基列的拉末。
{2Ch 18:3}  Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?" He answered him, "I am as you are, my people as your people. We will be with you in the war."
{2Ch 18:3}  以色列王亚哈问犹大王约沙法说：“你肯同我去攻取基列的拉末吗？”他回答说：“你我不分彼此，我的民与你的民一样，必与你同去争战。”
{2Ch 18:4}  And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Inquire first for the word of the LORD."
{2Ch 18:4}  约沙法对以色列王说：“请你先求问耶和华。”
{2Ch 18:5}  Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?" And they said, "Go up, for God will give it into the hand of the king."
{2Ch 18:5}  于是以色列王招聚先知四百人，问他们说：“我们上去攻取基列的拉末可以不可以？”他们说：“可以上去，因为神必将那城交在王的手里。”
{2Ch 18:6}  But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?"
{2Ch 18:6}  约沙法说：“这里不是还有耶和华的先知，我们可以求问他吗？”
{2Ch 18:7}  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil." And Jehoshaphat said, "Let not the king say so."
{2Ch 18:7}  以色列王对约沙法说：“还有一个人，是音拉的儿子米该雅。我们可以托他求问耶和华，只是我恨他；因为他指着我所说的预言，不说吉语，常说凶言。”约沙法说：“王不必这样说。”
{2Ch 18:8}  Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah."
{2Ch 18:8}  以色列王就召了一个太监来，说：“你快去将音拉的儿子米该雅召来。”
{2Ch 18:9}  Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes. And they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
{2Ch 18:9}  以色列王和犹大王约沙法在撒玛利亚城门前的空场上，各穿朝服坐在位上，所有的先知都在他们面前说预言。
{2Ch 18:10} And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.'"
{2Ch 18:10} 基拿拿的儿子西底家造了两个铁角，说：“耶和华如此说：‘你要用这角抵触亚兰人，直到将他们灭尽。’”
{2Ch 18:11} And all the prophets prophesied so and said, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph. The LORD will give it into the hand of the king."
{2Ch 18:11} 所有的先知也都这样预言说：“可以上基列的拉末去，必然得胜，因为耶和华必将那城交在王的手中。”
{2Ch 18:12} And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, "Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably."
{2Ch 18:12} 那去召米该雅的使者对米该雅说：“众先知一口同音地都向王说吉言，你不如与他们说一样的话，也说吉言。”
{2Ch 18:13} But Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, what my God says, that I will speak."
{2Ch 18:13} 米该雅说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，我的神说什么，我就说什么。”
{2Ch 18:14} And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?" And he answered, "Go up and triumph; they will be given into your hand."
{2Ch 18:14} 米该雅到王面前，王问他说：“米该雅啊，我们上去攻取基列的拉末可以不可以？”他说：“可以上去，必然得胜，敌人必交在你们手里。”
{2Ch 18:15} But the king said to him, "How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
{2Ch 18:15} 王对他说：“我当嘱咐你几次，你才奉耶和华的名向我说实话呢？”
{2Ch 18:16} And he said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, 'These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.'"
{2Ch 18:16} 米该雅说：“我看见以色列众民散在山上，如同没有牧人的羊群一般。耶和华说：‘这民没有主人，他们可以平平安安的各归各家去。’”
{2Ch 18:17} And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"
{2Ch 18:17} 以色列王对约沙法说：“我岂没有告诉你，这人指着我所说的预言，不说吉语，单说凶言吗？”
{2Ch 18:18} And Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
{2Ch 18:18} 米该雅说：“你们要听耶和华的话。我看见耶和华坐在宝座上，天上的万军侍立在他左右。
{2Ch 18:19} And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab the king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said one thing, and another said another.
{2Ch 18:19} 耶和华说：‘谁去引诱以色列王亚哈上基列的拉末去阵亡呢？’这个就这样说，那个就那样说。
{2Ch 18:20} Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, 'I will entice him.' And the LORD said to him, 'By what means?'
{2Ch 18:20} 随后，有一个神灵出来，站在耶和华面前说：‘我去引诱他。’耶和华问他说：‘你用何法呢？’
{2Ch 18:21} And he said, 'I will go out, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And he said, 'You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so.'
{2Ch 18:21} 他说：‘我去，要在他众先知口中作谎言的灵。’耶和华说：‘这样，你必能引诱他，你去如此行吧！’
{2Ch 18:22} Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets. The LORD has declared disaster concerning you."
{2Ch 18:22} 现在耶和华使谎言的灵入了你这些先知的口，并且耶和华已经命定降祸与你。”
{2Ch 18:23} Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, "Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?"
{2Ch 18:23} 基拿拿的儿子西底家前来打米该雅的脸，说：“耶和华的灵从那里离开我与你说话呢？”
{2Ch 18:24} And Micaiah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself."
{2Ch 18:24} 米该雅说：“你进严密的屋子藏躲的那日，就必看见了。”
{2Ch 18:25} And the king of Israel said, "Seize Micaiah and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son,
{2Ch 18:25} 以色列王说：“将米该雅带回，交给邑宰亚们和王的儿子约阿施，说：
{2Ch 18:26} and say, 'Thus says the king, Put this fellow in prison and feed him with meager rations of bread and water until I return in peace.'"
{2Ch 18:26} ‘王如此说：把这个人下在监里，使他受苦，吃不饱喝不足，等候我平平安安的回来。’”
{2Ch 18:27} And Micaiah said, "If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Hear, all you peoples!"
{2Ch 18:27} 米该雅说：“你若能平安回来，那就是耶和华没有藉我说这话了”；又说：“众民哪，你们都要听！”
{2Ch 18:28} So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
{2Ch 18:28} 以色列王和犹大王约沙法上基列的拉末去了。
{2Ch 18:29} And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes." And the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
{2Ch 18:29} 以色列王对约沙法说：“我要改装上阵，你可以仍穿王服。”于是以色列王改装，他们就上阵去了。
{2Ch 18:30} Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, "Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel."
{2Ch 18:30} 先是亚兰王吩咐车兵长说：“他们的兵将，无论大小，你们都不可与他们争战，只要与以色列王争战。”
{2Ch 18:31} As soon as the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "It is the king of Israel." So they turned to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; God drew them away from him.
{2Ch 18:31} 车兵长看见约沙法便说，这必是以色列王，就转过去与他争战。约沙法一呼喊，耶和华就帮助他，神又感动他们离开他。
{2Ch 18:32} For as soon as the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
{2Ch 18:32} 车兵长见不是以色列王，就转去不追他了。
{2Ch 18:33} But a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn around and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded."
{2Ch 18:33} 有一人随便开弓，恰巧射入以色列王的甲缝里。王对赶车的说：“我受了重伤，你转过车来，拉我出阵吧！”
{2Ch 18:34} And the battle continued that day, and the king of Israel was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening. Then at sunset he died.
{2Ch 18:34} 那日阵势越战越猛，以色列王勉强站在车上抵挡亚兰人，直到晚上。约在日落的时候，王就死了。
{2Ch 19:1}  Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 19:1}  犹大王约沙法平平安安的回耶路撒冷，到宫里去了。
{2Ch 19:2}  But Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, wrath has gone out against you from the LORD.
{2Ch 19:2}  先见哈拿尼的儿子耶户出来迎接约沙法王，对他说：“你岂当帮助恶人，爱那恨恶耶和华的人呢？因此耶和华的忿怒临到你。
{2Ch 19:3}  Nevertheless, some good is found in you, for you destroyed the Asheroth out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God."
{2Ch 19:3}  然而你还有善行，因你从国中除掉木偶，立定心意寻求神。”
{2Ch 19:4}  Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem. And he went out again among the people, from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
{2Ch 19:4}  约沙法住在耶路撒冷，以后又出巡民间，从别是巴直到以法莲山地，引导民归向耶和华他们列祖的神；
{2Ch 19:5}  He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
{2Ch 19:5}  又在犹大国中遍地的坚固城里设立审判官，
{2Ch 19:6}  and said to the judges, "Consider what you do, for you judge not for man but for the LORD. He is with you in giving judgment.
{2Ch 19:6}  对他们说：“你们办事应当谨慎；因为你们判断不是为人，乃是为耶和华。判断的时候，他必与你们同在。
{2Ch 19:7}  Now then, let the fear of the LORD be upon you. Be careful what you do, for there is no injustice with the LORD our God, or partiality or taking bribes."
{2Ch 19:7}  现在你们应当敬畏耶和华，谨慎办事；因为耶和华我们的神没有不义，不偏待人，也不受贿赂。”
{2Ch 19:8}  Moreover, in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed certain Levites and priests and heads of families of Israel, to give judgment for the LORD and to decide disputed cases. They had their seat at Jerusalem.
{2Ch 19:8}  约沙法从利未人和祭司，并以色列族长中派定人，在耶路撒冷为耶和华判断，听民间的争讼，就回耶路撒冷去了。
{2Ch 19:9}  And he charged them: "Thus you shall do in the fear of the LORD, in faithfulness, and with your whole heart:
{2Ch 19:9}  约沙法嘱咐他们说：“你们当敬畏耶和华，忠心诚实办事。
{2Ch 19:10} whenever a case comes to you from your brothers who live in their cities, concerning bloodshed, law or commandment, statutes or rules, then you shall warn them, that they may not incur guilt before the LORD and wrath may not come upon you and your brothers. Thus you shall do, and you will not incur guilt.
{2Ch 19:10} 住在各城里你们的弟兄，若有争讼的事来到你们这里，或为流血，或犯律法、诫命、律例、典章，你们要警戒他们，免得他们得罪耶和华，以致他的忿怒临到你们和你们的弟兄；这样行，你们就没有罪了。
{2Ch 19:11} And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the governor of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters, and the Levites will serve you as officers. Deal courageously, and may the LORD be with the upright!"
{2Ch 19:11} 凡属耶和华的事，有大祭司亚玛利雅管理你们；凡属王的事，有犹大支派的族长以实玛利的儿子西巴第雅管理你们；在你们面前有利未人作官长。你们应当壮胆办事，愿耶和华与善人同在。”
{2Ch 20:1}  After this the Moabites and Ammonites, and with them some of the Meunites, came against Jehoshaphat for battle.
{2Ch 20:1}  此后，摩押人和亚扪人，又有米乌尼人，一同来攻击约沙法。
{2Ch 20:2}  Some men came and told Jehoshaphat, "A great multitude is coming against you from Edom, from beyond the sea; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar" (that is, Engedi).
{2Ch 20:2}  有人来报告约沙法说：“从海外亚兰（又作以东）那边有大军来攻击你，如今他们在哈洗逊他玛，就是隐基底。”
{2Ch 20:3}  Then Jehoshaphat was afraid and set his face to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
{2Ch 20:3}  约沙法便惧怕，定意寻求耶和华，在犹大全地宣告禁食。
{2Ch 20:4}  And Judah assembled to seek help from the LORD; from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.
{2Ch 20:4}  于是犹大人聚会，求耶和华帮助。犹大各城都有人出来寻求耶和华。
{2Ch 20:5}  And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,
{2Ch 20:5}  约沙法就在犹大和耶路撒冷的会中，站在耶和华殿的新院前，
{2Ch 20:6}  and said, "O LORD, God of our fathers, are you not God in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. In your hand are power and might, so that none is able to withstand you.
{2Ch 20:6}  说：“耶和华我们列祖的神啊，你不是天上的神吗？你不是万邦万国的主宰吗？在你手中有大能大力，无人能抵挡你。
{2Ch 20:7}  Did you not, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?
{2Ch 20:7}  我们的神啊，你不是曾在你民以色列人面前驱逐这地的居民，将这地赐给你朋友亚伯拉罕的后裔永远为业吗？
{2Ch 20:8}  And they have lived in it and have built for you in it a sanctuary for your name, saying,
{2Ch 20:8}  他们住在这地，又为你的名建造圣所，说：
{2Ch 20:9}  'If disaster comes upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before you--for your name is in this house--and cry out to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.'
{2Ch 20:9}  ‘倘有祸患临到我们，或刀兵灾殃，或瘟疫饥荒，我们在急难的时候，站在这殿前向你呼求，你必垂听而拯救，因为你的名在这殿里。’
{2Ch 20:10} And now behold, the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade when they came from the land of Egypt, and whom they avoided and did not destroy--
{2Ch 20:10} 从前以色列人出埃及地的时候，你不容以色列人侵犯亚扪人、摩押人，和西珥山人，以色列人就离开他们，不灭绝他们。
{2Ch 20:11} behold, they reward us by coming to drive us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.
{2Ch 20:11} 看哪，他们怎样报复我们，要来驱逐我们出离你的地，就是你赐给我们为业之地。
{2Ch 20:12} O our God, will you not execute judgment on them? For we are powerless against this great horde that is coming against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you."
{2Ch 20:12} 我们的神啊，你不惩罚他们吗？因为我们无力抵挡这来攻击我们的大军，我们也不知道怎样行，我们的眼目单仰望你。”
{2Ch 20:13} Meanwhile all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
{2Ch 20:13} 犹大众人和他们的婴孩、妻子、儿女都站在耶和华面前。
{2Ch 20:14} And the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.
{2Ch 20:14} 那时，耶和华的灵在会中临到利未人亚萨的后裔玛探雅的玄孙，耶利的曾孙，比拿雅的孙子，撒迦利雅的儿子雅哈悉。
{2Ch 20:15} And he said, "Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat: Thus says the LORD to you, 'Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed at this great horde, for the battle is not yours but God's.
{2Ch 20:15} 他说：“犹大众人、耶路撒冷的居民，和约沙法王，你们请听。耶和华对你们如此说：‘不要因这大军恐惧惊惶；因为胜败不在乎你们，乃在乎神。
{2Ch 20:16} Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they will come up by the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley, east of the wilderness of Jeruel.
{2Ch 20:16} 明日你们要下去迎敌，他们是从洗斯坡上来，你们必在耶鲁伊勒旷野前的谷口遇见他们。
{2Ch 20:17} You will not need to fight in this battle. Stand firm, hold your position, and see the salvation of the LORD on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem.' Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, and the LORD will be with you."
{2Ch 20:17} 犹大和耶路撒冷人哪，这次你们不要争战，要摆阵站着，看耶和华为你们施行拯救。不要恐惧，也不要惊惶。明日当出去迎敌，因为耶和华与你们同在。’”
{2Ch 20:18} Then Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the LORD, worshiping the LORD.
{2Ch 20:18} 约沙法就面伏于地，犹大众人和耶路撒冷的居民也俯伏在耶和华面前，叩拜耶和华。
{2Ch 20:19} And the Levites, of the Kohathites and the Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice.
{2Ch 20:19} 哥辖族和可拉族的利未人都起来，用极大的声音赞美耶和华以色列的神。
{2Ch 20:20} And they rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. And when they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Hear me, Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in the LORD your God, and you will be established; believe his prophets, and you will succeed."
{2Ch 20:20} 次日清早，众人起来往提哥亚的旷野去。出去的时候，约沙法站着说：“犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民哪，要听我说：信耶和华你们的神就必立稳；信他的先知就必亨通。”
{2Ch 20:21} And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to the LORD and praise him in holy attire, as they went before the army, and say, "Give thanks to the LORD, for his steadfast love endures forever."
{2Ch 20:21} 约沙法既与民商议了，就设立歌唱的人，颂赞耶和华，使他们穿上圣洁的礼服，走在军前赞美耶和华说：“当称谢耶和华，因他的慈爱永远长存！”
{2Ch 20:22} And when they began to sing and praise, the LORD set an ambush against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah, so that they were routed.
{2Ch 20:22} 众人方唱歌赞美的时候，耶和华就派伏兵击杀那来攻击犹大人的亚扪人、摩押人，和西珥山人，他们就被打败了。
{2Ch 20:23} For the men of Ammon and Moab rose against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, devoting them to destruction, and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they all helped to destroy one another.
{2Ch 20:23} 因为亚扪人和摩押人起来，击杀住西珥山的人，将他们灭尽；灭尽住西珥山的人之后，他们又彼此自相击杀。
{2Ch 20:24} When Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness, they looked toward the horde, and behold, there were dead bodies lying on the ground; none had escaped.
{2Ch 20:24} 犹大人来到旷野的望楼，向那大军观看，见尸横遍地，没有一个逃脱的。
{2Ch 20:25} When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found among them, in great numbers, goods, clothing, and precious things, which they took for themselves until they could carry no more. They were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much.
{2Ch 20:25} 约沙法和他的百姓就来收取敌人的财物，在尸首中见了许多财物、珍宝，他们剥脱下来的多得不可携带；因为甚多，直收取了三日。
{2Ch 20:26} On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, for there they blessed the LORD. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Beracah to this day.
{2Ch 20:26} 第四日众人聚集在比拉迦谷（就是称颂的意思），在那里称颂耶和华。因此那地方名叫比拉迦谷，直到今日。
{2Ch 20:27} Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, returning to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies.
{2Ch 20:27} 犹大人和耶路撒冷人都欢欢喜喜地回耶路撒冷，约沙法率领他们；因为耶和华使他们战胜仇敌，就欢喜快乐。
{2Ch 20:28} They came to Jerusalem with harps and lyres and trumpets, to the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 20:28} 他们弹琴、鼓瑟、吹号来到耶路撒冷，进了耶和华的殿。
{2Ch 20:29} And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
{2Ch 20:29} 列邦诸国听见耶和华战败以色列的仇敌，就甚惧怕。
{2Ch 20:30} So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.
{2Ch 20:30} 这样，约沙法的国得享太平，因为神赐他四境平安。
{2Ch 20:31} Thus Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
{2Ch 20:31} 约沙法作犹大王，登基的时候年三十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十五年。他母亲名叫阿苏巴，乃示利希的女儿。
{2Ch 20:32} He walked in the way of Asa his father and did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD.
{2Ch 20:32} 约沙法效法他父亚撒所行的，不偏左右，行耶和华眼中看为正的事。
{2Ch 20:33} The high places, however, were not taken away; the people had not yet set their hearts upon the God of their fathers.
{2Ch 20:33} 只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓也没有立定心意归向他们列祖的神。
{2Ch 20:34} Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, are written in the chronicles of Jehu the son of Hanani, which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
{2Ch 20:34} 约沙法其余的事，自始至终都写在哈拿尼的儿子耶户的书上，也载入以色列诸王记上。
{2Ch 20:35} After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted wickedly.
{2Ch 20:35} 此后，犹大王约沙法与以色列王亚哈谢交好；亚哈谢行恶太甚。
{2Ch 20:36} He joined him in building ships to go to Tarshish, and they built the ships in Ezion-geber.
{2Ch 20:36} 二王合夥造船要往他施去，遂在以旬迦别造船。
{2Ch 20:37} Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, "Because you have joined with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have made." And the ships were wrecked and were not able to go to Tarshish.
{2Ch 20:37} 那时玛利沙人、多大瓦的儿子以利以谢向约沙法预言说：“因你与亚哈谢交好，耶和华必破坏你所造的。”后来那船果然破坏，不能往他施去了。
{2Ch 21:1}  Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son reigned in his place.
{2Ch 21:1}  约沙法与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子约兰接续他作王。
{2Ch 21:2}  He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
{2Ch 21:2}  约兰有几个兄弟，就是约沙法的儿子亚撒利雅、耶歇、撒迦利雅、亚撒利雅、米迦勒、示法提雅。这都是犹大王约沙法的儿子。
{2Ch 21:3}  Their father gave them great gifts of silver, gold, and valuable possessions, together with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.
{2Ch 21:3}  他们的父亲将许多金银、财宝，和犹大地的坚固城赐给他们；但将国赐给约兰，因为他是长子。
{2Ch 21:4}  When Jehoram had ascended the throne of his father and was established, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel.
{2Ch 21:4}  约兰兴起坐他父的位，奋勇自强，就用刀杀了他的众兄弟和以色列的几个首领。
{2Ch 21:5}  Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 21:5}  约兰登基的时候年三十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王八年。
{2Ch 21:6}  And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
{2Ch 21:6}  他行以色列诸王的道，与亚哈家一样；因他娶了亚哈的女儿为妻，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。
{2Ch 21:7}  Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.
{2Ch 21:7}  耶和华却因自己与大卫所立的约，不肯灭大卫的家，照他所应许的，永远赐灯光与大卫和他的子孙。
{2Ch 21:8}  In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah and set up a king of their own.
{2Ch 21:8}  约兰年间，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，自己立王。
{2Ch 21:9}  Then Jehoram passed over with his commanders and all his chariots, and he rose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and his chariot commanders.
{2Ch 21:9}  约兰就率领军长和所有的战车，夜间起来，攻击围困他的以东人和车兵长。
{2Ch 21:10} So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah also revolted from his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.
{2Ch 21:10} 这样，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，直到今日。那时，立拿人也背叛了，因为约兰离弃耶和华他列祖的神。
{2Ch 21:11} Moreover, he made high places in the hill country of Judah and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem into whoredom and made Judah go astray.
{2Ch 21:11} 他又在犹大诸山建筑邱坛，使耶路撒冷的居民行邪淫，诱惑犹大人。
{2Ch 21:12} And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father, 'Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
{2Ch 21:12} 先知以利亚达信与约兰说：“耶和华你祖大卫的神如此说：‘因为你不行你父约沙法和犹大王亚撒的道，
{2Ch 21:13} but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel and have enticed Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into whoredom, as the house of Ahab led Israel into whoredom, and also you have killed your brothers, of your father's house, who were better than you,
{2Ch 21:13} 乃行以色列诸王的道，使犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民行邪淫，像亚哈家一样，又杀了你父家比你好的诸兄弟。
{2Ch 21:14} behold, the LORD will bring a great plague on your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions,
{2Ch 21:14} 故此，耶和华降大灾与你的百姓和你的妻子、儿女，并你一切所有的。
{2Ch 21:15} and you yourself will have a severe sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the disease, day by day.'"
{2Ch 21:15} 你的肠子必患病，日加沉重，以致你的肠子坠落下来。’”
{2Ch 21:16} And the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the anger of the Philistines and of the Arabians who are near the Ethiopians.
{2Ch 21:16} 以后，耶和华激动非利士人和靠近古实的亚拉伯人来攻击约兰。
{2Ch 21:17} And they came up against Judah and invaded it and carried away all the possessions they found that belonged to the king's house, and also his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest son.
{2Ch 21:17} 他们上来攻击犹大，侵入境内，掳掠了王宫里所有的财货和他的妻子、儿女，除了他小儿子约哈斯（又名亚哈谢）之外，没有留下一个儿子。
{2Ch 21:18} And after all this the LORD struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
{2Ch 21:18} 这些事以后，耶和华使约兰的肠子患不能医治的病。
{2Ch 21:19} In the course of time, at the end of two years, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great agony. His people made no fire in his honor, like the fires made for his fathers.
{2Ch 21:19} 他患此病缠绵日久，过了二年，肠子坠落下来，病重而死。他的民没有为他烧什么物件，像从前为他列祖所烧的一样。
{2Ch 21:20} He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed with no one's regret. They buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
{2Ch 21:20} 约兰登基的时候年三十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王八年。他去世无人思慕，众人葬他在大卫城，只是不在列王的坟墓里。
{2Ch 22:1}  And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
{2Ch 22:1}  耶路撒冷的居民立约兰的小儿子亚哈谢接续他作王；因为跟随亚拉伯人来攻营的军兵曾杀了亚哈谢的众兄长。这样，犹大王约兰的儿子亚哈谢作了王。
{2Ch 22:2}  Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri.
{2Ch 22:2}  亚哈谢登基的时候年四十二岁（列王下八章二十六节是二十二岁），在耶路撒冷作王一年。他母亲名叫亚他利雅，是暗利的孙女。
{2Ch 22:3}  He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in doing wickedly.
{2Ch 22:3}  亚哈谢也行亚哈家的道；因为他母亲给他主谋，使他行恶。
{2Ch 22:4}  He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done. For after the death of his father they were his counselors, to his undoing.
{2Ch 22:4}  他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，像亚哈家一样；因他父亲死后有亚哈家的人给他主谋，以致败坏。
{2Ch 22:5}  He even followed their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram,
{2Ch 22:5}  他听从亚哈家的计谋，同以色列王亚哈的儿子约兰往基列的拉末去，与亚兰王哈薛争战；亚兰人打伤了约兰。
{2Ch 22:6}  and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was wounded.
{2Ch 22:6}  约兰回到耶斯列，医治在拉末与亚兰王哈薛打仗所受的伤，犹大王约兰的儿子亚撒利雅（就是亚哈谢）因为亚哈的儿子约兰病了，就下到耶斯列看望他。
{2Ch 22:7}  But it was ordained by God that the downfall of Ahaziah should come about through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there, he went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
{2Ch 22:7}  亚哈谢去见约兰就被害了，这是出乎神；因为他到了，就同约兰出去攻击宁示的孙子耶户。这耶户是耶和华所膏、使他剪除亚哈家的。
{2Ch 22:8}  And when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he met the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers, who attended Ahaziah, and he killed them.
{2Ch 22:8}  耶户讨亚哈家罪的时候，遇见犹大的众首领和亚哈谢的众侄子服事亚哈谢，就把他们都杀了。
{2Ch 22:9}  He searched for Ahaziah, and he was captured while hiding in Samaria, and he was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, "He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart." And the house of Ahaziah had no one able to rule the kingdom.
{2Ch 22:9}  亚哈谢藏在撒玛利亚，耶户寻找他，众人将他拿住，送到耶户那里，就杀了他，将他葬埋；因他们说，他是那尽心寻求耶和华之约沙法的儿子。这样，亚哈谢的家无力保守国权。
{2Ch 22:10} Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family of the house of Judah.
{2Ch 22:10} 亚哈谢的母亲亚他利雅见他儿子死了，就起来剿灭犹大王室。
{2Ch 22:11} But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king's sons who were about to be put to death, and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she was a sister of Ahaziah, hid him from Athaliah, so that she did not put him to death.
{2Ch 22:11} 但王的女儿约示巴将亚哈谢的儿子约阿施从那被杀的王子中偷出来，把他和他的乳母都藏在卧房里。约示巴是约兰王的女儿，亚哈谢的妹子，祭司耶何耶大的妻。他收藏约阿施，躲避亚他利雅，免得被杀。
{2Ch 22:12} And he remained with them six years, hidden in the house of God, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
{2Ch 22:12} 约阿施和他们一同藏在神殿里六年；亚他利雅篡了国位。
{2Ch 23:1}  But in the seventh year Jehoiada took courage and entered into a covenant with the commanders of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri.
{2Ch 23:1}  第七年，耶何耶大奋勇自强，将百夫长耶罗罕的儿子亚撒利雅，约哈难的儿子以实玛利，俄备得的儿子亚撒利雅，亚大雅的儿子玛西雅，细基利的儿子以利沙法召来，与他们立约。
{2Ch 23:2}  And they went about through Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers' houses of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
{2Ch 23:2}  他们走遍犹大，从犹大各城里招聚利未人和以色列的众族长到耶路撒冷来。
{2Ch 23:3}  And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And Jehoiada said to them, "Behold, the king's son! Let him reign, as the LORD spoke concerning the sons of David.
{2Ch 23:3}  会众在神殿里与王立约。耶何耶大对他们说：“看哪，王的儿子必当作王，正如耶和华指着大卫子孙所应许的话”；
{2Ch 23:4}  This is the thing that you shall do: of you priests and Levites who come off duty on the Sabbath, one third shall be gatekeepers,
{2Ch 23:4}  又说：“你们当这样行：祭司和利未人凡安息日进班的，三分之一要把守各门，
{2Ch 23:5}  and one third shall be at the king's house and one third at the Gate of the Foundation. And all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 23:5}  三分之一要在王宫，三分之一要在基址门；众百姓要在耶和华殿的院内。
{2Ch 23:6}  Let no one enter the house of the LORD except the priests and ministering Levites. They may enter, for they are holy, but all the people shall keep the charge of the LORD.
{2Ch 23:6}  除了祭司和供职的利未人之外，不准别人进耶和华的殿；惟独他们可以进去，因为他们圣洁。众百姓要遵守耶和华所吩咐的。
{2Ch 23:7}  The Levites shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand. And whoever enters the house shall be put to death. Be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out."
{2Ch 23:7}  利未人要手中各拿兵器，四围护卫王；凡擅入殿宇的，必当治死。王出入的时候，你们当跟随他。”
{2Ch 23:8}  The Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and they each brought his men, who were to go off duty on the Sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the divisions.
{2Ch 23:8}  利未人和犹大众人都照着祭司耶何耶大一切所吩咐的去行，各带所管安息日进班出班的人来，因为祭司耶何耶大不许他们下班。
{2Ch 23:9}  And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains the spears and the large and small shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of God.
{2Ch 23:9}  祭司耶何耶大便将神殿里所藏大卫王的枪、盾牌、挡牌交给百夫长，
{2Ch 23:10} And he set all the people as a guard for the king, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house.
{2Ch 23:10} 又分派众民手中各拿兵器，在坛和殿那里，从殿右直到殿左，站在王子的四围；
{2Ch 23:11} Then they brought out the king's son and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony. And they proclaimed him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and they said, "Long live the king."
{2Ch 23:11} 于是领王子出来，给他戴上冠冕，将律法书交给他，立他作王。耶何耶大和众子膏他，众人说：“愿王万岁！”
{2Ch 23:12} When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she went into the house of the LORD to the people.
{2Ch 23:12} 亚他利雅听见民奔走赞美王的声音，就到民那里，进耶和华的殿，
{2Ch 23:13} And when she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and the singers with their musical instruments leading in the celebration. And Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, "Treason! Treason!"
{2Ch 23:13} 看见王站在殿门的柱旁，百夫长和吹号的人侍立在王左右，国民都欢乐吹号，又有歌唱的，用各样的乐器领人歌唱赞美；亚他利雅就撕裂衣服，喊叫说：“反了！反了！”
{2Ch 23:14} Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains who were set over the army, saying to them, "Bring her out between the ranks, and anyone who follows her is to be put to death with the sword." For the priest said, "Do not put her to death in the house of the LORD."
{2Ch 23:14} 祭司耶何耶大带管辖军兵的百夫长出来，吩咐他们说：“将他赶到班外，凡跟随他的必用刀杀死！”因为祭司说：“不可在耶和华殿里杀他。”
{2Ch 23:15} So they laid hands on her, and she went into the entrance of the horse gate of the king's house, and they put her to death there.
{2Ch 23:15} 众兵就闪开，让他去；他走到王宫的马门，便在那里把他杀了。
{2Ch 23:16} And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be the LORD's people.
{2Ch 23:16} 耶何耶大与众民和王立约，都要作耶和华的民。
{2Ch 23:17} Then all the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
{2Ch 23:17} 于是众民都到巴力庙，拆毁了庙，打碎坛和像，又在坛前将巴力的祭司玛坦杀了。
{2Ch 23:18} And Jehoiada posted watchmen for the house of the LORD under the direction of the Levitical priests and the Levites whom David had organized to be in charge of the house of the LORD, to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.
{2Ch 23:18} 耶何耶大派官看守耶和华的殿，是在祭司利未人手下。这祭司利未人是大卫分派在耶和华殿中、照摩西律法上所写的，给耶和华献燔祭，又按大卫所定的例，欢乐歌唱；
{2Ch 23:19} He stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD so that no one should enter who was in any way unclean.
{2Ch 23:19} 且设立守门的把守耶和华殿的各门，无论为何事，不洁净的人都不准进去。
{2Ch 23:20} And he took the captains, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, marching through the upper gate to the king's house. And they set the king on the royal throne.
{2Ch 23:20} 又率领百夫长和贵胄，与民间的官长，并国中的众民，请王从耶和华殿下来，由上门进入王宫，立王坐在国位上。
{2Ch 23:21} So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been put to death with the sword.
{2Ch 23:21} 国民都欢乐，合城都安静。众人已将亚他利雅用刀杀了。
{2Ch 24:1}  Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
{2Ch 24:1}  约阿施登基的时候年七岁，在耶路撒冷作王四十年。他母亲名叫西比亚，是别是巴人。
{2Ch 24:2}  And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
{2Ch 24:2}  祭司耶何耶大在世的时候，约阿施行耶和华眼中看为正的事。
{2Ch 24:3}  Jehoiada got for him two wives, and he had sons and daughters.
{2Ch 24:3}  耶何耶大为他娶了两个妻，并且生儿养女。
{2Ch 24:4}  After this Joash decided to restore the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 24:4}  此后，约阿施有意重修耶和华的殿，
{2Ch 24:5}  And he gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them, "Go out to the cities of Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you act quickly." But the Levites did not act quickly.
{2Ch 24:5}  便召聚众祭司和利未人，吩咐他们说：“你们要往犹大各城去，使以色列众人捐纳银子，每年可以修理你们神的殿；你们要急速办理这事。”只是利未人不急速办理。
{2Ch 24:6}  So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief and said to him, "Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the congregation of Israel for the tent of testimony?"
{2Ch 24:6}  王召了大祭司耶何耶大来，对他说：“从前耶和华的仆人摩西，为法柜的帐幕与以色列会众所定的捐项，你为何不叫利未人照这例从犹大和耶路撒冷带来作殿的费用呢？”
{2Ch 24:7}  For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also used all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD for the Baals.
{2Ch 24:7}  （因为那恶妇亚他利雅的众子曾拆毁神的殿，又用耶和华殿中分别为圣的物供奉巴力。）
{2Ch 24:8}  So the king commanded, and they made a chest and set it outside the gate of the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 24:8}  于是王下令，众人做了一柜，放在耶和华殿的门外，
{2Ch 24:9}  And proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in for the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.
{2Ch 24:9}  又通告犹大和耶路撒冷的百姓，要将神仆人摩西在旷野所吩咐以色列人的捐项给耶和华送来。
{2Ch 24:10} And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought their tax and dropped it into the chest until they had finished.
{2Ch 24:10} 众首领和百姓都欢欢喜喜地将银子送来，投入柜中，直到捐完。
{2Ch 24:11} And whenever the chest was brought to the king's officers by the Levites, when they saw that there was much money in it, the king's secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and take it and return it to its place. Thus they did day after day, and collected money in abundance.
{2Ch 24:11} 利未人见银子多了，就把柜抬到王所派的司事面前；王的书记和大祭司的属员来将柜倒空，仍放在原处。日日都是这样，积蓄的银子甚多。
{2Ch 24:12} And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who had charge of the work of the house of the LORD, and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 24:12} 王与耶何耶大将银子交给耶和华殿里办事的人，他们就雇了石匠、木匠重修耶和华的殿，又雇了铁匠、铜匠修理耶和华的殿。
{2Ch 24:13} So those who were engaged in the work labored, and the repairing went forward in their hands, and they restored the house of God to its proper condition and strengthened it.
{2Ch 24:13} 工人操作，渐渐修成，将神殿修造得与从前一样，而且甚是坚固。
{2Ch 24:14} And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made utensils for the house of the LORD, both for the service and for the burnt offerings, and dishes for incense and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD regularly all the days of Jehoiada.
{2Ch 24:14} 工程完了，他们就把其余的银子拿到王与耶何耶大面前，用以制造耶和华殿供奉所用的器皿和调羹，并金银的器皿。耶何耶大在世的时候，众人常在耶和华殿里献燔祭。
{2Ch 24:15} But Jehoiada grew old and full of days, and died. He was 130 years old at his death.
{2Ch 24:15} 耶何耶大年纪老迈，日子满足而死。死的时候年一百三十岁，
{2Ch 24:16} And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.
{2Ch 24:16} 葬在大卫城列王的坟墓里；因为他在以色列人中行善，又事奉神，修理神的殿。
{2Ch 24:17} Now after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and paid homage to the king. Then the king listened to them.
{2Ch 24:17} 耶何耶大死后，犹大的众首领来朝拜王；王就听从他们。
{2Ch 24:18} And they abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs.
{2Ch 24:18} 他们离弃耶和华他们列祖神的殿，去事奉亚舍拉和偶像；因他们这罪，就有忿怒临到犹大和耶路撒冷。
{2Ch 24:19} Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to the LORD. These testified against them, but they would not pay attention.
{2Ch 24:19} 但神仍遣先知到他们那里，引导他们归向耶和华。这先知警戒他们，他们却不肯听。
{2Ch 24:20} Then the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he stood above the people, and said to them, "Thus says God, 'Why do you break the commandments of the LORD, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has forsaken you.'"
{2Ch 24:20} 那时，神的灵感动祭司耶何耶大的儿子撒迦利亚，他就站在上面对民说：“神如此说：你们为何干犯耶和华的诫命，以致不得亨通呢？因为你们离弃耶和华，所以他也离弃你们。”
{2Ch 24:21} But they conspired against him, and by command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 24:21} 众民同心谋害撒迦利亚，就照王的吩咐，在耶和华殿的院内用石头打死他。
{2Ch 24:22} Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada, Zechariah's father, had shown him, but killed his son. And when he was dying, he said, "May the LORD see and avenge!"
{2Ch 24:22} 这样，约阿施王不想念撒迦利亚的父亲耶何耶大向自己所施的恩，杀了他的儿子。撒迦利亚临死的时候说：“愿耶和华鉴察伸冤！”
{2Ch 24:23} At the end of the year the army of the Syrians came up against Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.
{2Ch 24:23} 满了一年，亚兰的军兵上来攻击约阿施，来到犹大和耶路撒冷，杀了民中的众首领，将所掠的财货送到大马色王那里。
{2Ch 24:24} Though the army of the Syrians had come with few men, the LORD delivered into their hand a very great army, because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment on Joash.
{2Ch 24:24} 亚兰的军兵虽来了一小队，耶和华却将大队的军兵交在他们手里，是因犹大人离弃耶和华他们列祖的神，所以藉亚兰人惩罚约阿施。
{2Ch 24:25} When they had departed from him, leaving him severely wounded, his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.
{2Ch 24:25} 亚兰人离开约阿施的时候，他患重病；臣仆背叛他，要报祭司耶何耶大儿子流血之仇，杀他在床上，葬他在大卫城，只是不葬在列王的坟墓里。
{2Ch 24:26} Those who conspired against him were Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonite, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabite.
{2Ch 24:26} 背叛他的是亚扪妇人示米押的儿子撒拔和摩押妇人示米利的儿子约萨拔。
{2Ch 24:27} Accounts of his sons and of the many oracles against him and of the rebuilding of the house of God are written in the Story of the Book of the Kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
{2Ch 24:27} 至于他的众子和他所受的警戒，并他重修神殿的事，都写在列王的传上。他儿子亚玛谢接续他作王。
{2Ch 25:1}  Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
{2Ch 25:1}  亚玛谢登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十九年。他母亲名叫约耶但，是耶路撒冷人。
{2Ch 25:2}  And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not with a whole heart.
{2Ch 25:2}  亚玛谢行耶和华眼中看为正的事，只是心不专诚。
{2Ch 25:3}  And as soon as the royal power was firmly his, he killed his servants who had struck down the king his father.
{2Ch 25:3}  国一坚定，就把杀他父王的臣仆杀了，
{2Ch 25:4}  But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, "Fathers shall not die because of their children, nor children die because of their fathers, but each one shall die for his own sin."
{2Ch 25:4}  却没有治死他们的儿子，是照摩西律法书上耶和华所吩咐的说：“不可因子杀父，也不可因父杀子，各人要为本身的罪而死。”
{2Ch 25:5}  Then Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and set them by fathers' houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those twenty years old and upward, and found that they were 300,000 choice men, fit for war, able to handle spear and shield.
{2Ch 25:5}  亚玛谢招聚犹大人，按着犹大和便雅悯的宗族设立千夫长、百夫长，又数点人数，从二十岁以外，能拿枪拿盾牌出去打仗的精兵共有三十万；
{2Ch 25:6}  He hired also 100,000 mighty men of valor from Israel for 100 talents of silver.
{2Ch 25:6}  又用银子一百他连得，从以色列招募了十万大能的勇士。
{2Ch 25:7}  But a man of God came to him and said, "O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel, with all these Ephraimites.
{2Ch 25:7}  有一个神人来见亚玛谢，对他说：“王啊，不要使以色列的军兵与你同去，因为耶和华不与以色列人以法莲的后裔同在。
{2Ch 25:8}  But go, act, be strong for the battle. Why should you suppose that God will cast you down before the enemy? For God has power to help or to cast down."
{2Ch 25:8}  你若一定要去，就奋勇争战吧！但神必使你败在敌人面前；因为神能助人得胜，也能使人倾败。”
{2Ch 25:9}  And Amaziah said to the man of God, "But what shall we do about the hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel?" The man of God answered, "The LORD is able to give you much more than this."
{2Ch 25:9}  亚玛谢问神人说：“我给了以色列军的那一百他连得银子怎么样呢？”神人回答说：“耶和华能把更多的赐给你。”
{2Ch 25:10} Then Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim to go home again. And they became very angry with Judah and returned home in fierce anger.
{2Ch 25:10} 于是亚玛谢将那从以法莲来的军兵分别出来，叫他们回家去。故此，他们甚恼怒犹大人，气忿忿地回家去了。
{2Ch 25:11} But Amaziah took courage and led out his people and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down 10,000 men of Seir.
{2Ch 25:11} 亚玛谢壮起胆来，率领他的民到盐谷，杀了西珥人一万。
{2Ch 25:12} The men of Judah captured another 10,000 alive and took them to the top of a rock and threw them down from the top of the rock, and they were all dashed to pieces.
{2Ch 25:12} 犹大人又生擒了一万带到山崖上，从那里把他们扔下去，以致他们都摔碎了。
{2Ch 25:13} But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, not letting them go with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 3,000 people in them and took much spoil.
{2Ch 25:13} 但亚玛谢所打发回去、不许一同出征的那些军兵攻打犹大各城，从撒玛利亚直到伯和仑，杀了三千人，抢了许多财物。
{2Ch 25:14} After Amaziah came from striking down the Edomites, he brought the gods of the men of Seir and set them up as his gods and worshiped them, making offerings to them.
{2Ch 25:14} 亚玛谢杀了以东人回来，就把西珥的神像带回，立为自己的神，在他面前叩拜烧香。
{2Ch 25:15} Therefore the LORD was angry with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet, who said to him, "Why have you sought the gods of a people who did not deliver their own people from your hand?"
{2Ch 25:15} 因此，耶和华的怒气向亚玛谢发作，就差一个先知去见他，说：“这些神不能救他的民脱离你的手，你为何寻求他呢？”
{2Ch 25:16} But as he was speaking, the king said to him, "Have we made you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?" So the prophet stopped, but said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel."
{2Ch 25:16} 先知与王说话的时候，王对他说：“谁立你作王的谋士呢？你住口吧！为何找打呢？”先知就止住了，又说：“你行这事，不听从我的劝戒，我知道神定意要灭你。”
{2Ch 25:17} Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face."
{2Ch 25:17} 犹大王亚玛谢与群臣商议，就差遣使者去见耶户的孙子、约哈斯的儿子、以色列王约阿施，说：“你来，我们二人相见于战场。”
{2Ch 25:18} And Joash the king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah, "A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son for a wife,' and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle.
{2Ch 25:18} 以色列王约阿施差遣使者去见犹大王亚玛谢，说：“利巴嫩的蒺藜差遣使者去见利巴嫩的香柏树，说：‘将你的女儿给我儿子为妻。’后来利巴嫩有一个野兽经过，把蒺藜践踏了。
{2Ch 25:19} You say, 'See, I have struck down Edom,' and your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness. But now stay at home. Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?"
{2Ch 25:19} 你说：‘看哪，我打败了以东人’，你就心高气傲，以致矜夸。你在家里安居就罢了，为何要惹祸使自己和犹大国一同败亡呢？”
{2Ch 25:20} But Amaziah would not listen, for it was of God, in order that he might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought the gods of Edom.
{2Ch 25:20} 亚玛谢却不肯听从。这是出乎神，好将他们交在敌人手里，因为他们寻求以东的神。
{2Ch 25:21} So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
{2Ch 25:21} 于是以色列王约阿施上来，在犹大的伯示麦与犹大王亚玛谢相见于战场。
{2Ch 25:22} And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
{2Ch 25:22} 犹大人败在以色列人面前，各自逃回家里去了。
{2Ch 25:23} And Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for 400 cubits, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate.
{2Ch 25:23} 以色列王约阿施在伯示麦擒住约哈斯（就是亚哈谢）的孙子、约阿施的儿子、犹大王亚玛谢，将他带到耶路撒冷，又拆毁耶路撒冷的城墙，从以法莲门直到角门，共四百肘；
{2Ch 25:24} And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God, in the care of Obed-edom. He seized also the treasuries of the king's house, also hostages, and he returned to Samaria.
{2Ch 25:24} 又将俄别以东所看守神殿里的一切金银和器皿，与王宫里的财宝都拿了去，并带人去为质，就回撒玛利亚去了。
{2Ch 25:25} Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
{2Ch 25:25} 以色列王约哈斯的儿子约阿施死后，犹大王约阿施的儿子亚玛谢又活了十五年。
{2Ch 25:26} Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, from first to last, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?
{2Ch 25:26} 亚玛谢其余的事，自始至终不都写在犹大和以色列诸王记上吗？
{2Ch 25:27} From the time when he turned away from the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there.
{2Ch 25:27} 自从亚玛谢离弃耶和华之后，在耶路撒冷有人背叛他，他就逃到拉吉；叛党却打发人到拉吉，将他杀了。
{2Ch 25:28} And they brought him upon horses, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David.
{2Ch 25:28} 人就用马将他的尸首驮回，葬在犹大京城他列祖的坟地里。
{2Ch 26:1}  And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
{2Ch 26:1}  犹大众民立亚玛谢的儿子乌西雅（又名亚撒利雅）接续他父作王，那时他年十六岁。
{2Ch 26:2}  He built Eloth and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
{2Ch 26:2}  （亚玛谢与他列祖同睡之后，乌西雅收回以禄仍归犹大，又重新修理。）
{2Ch 26:3}  Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
{2Ch 26:3}  乌西雅登基的时候年十六岁，在耶路撒冷作王五十二年。他母亲名叫耶可利雅，是耶路撒冷人。
{2Ch 26:4}  And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
{2Ch 26:4}  乌西雅行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他父亚玛谢一切所行的；
{2Ch 26:5}  He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God, and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper.
{2Ch 26:5}  通晓神默示，撒迦利亚在世的时候，乌西雅定意寻求神；他寻求耶和华，神就使他亨通。
{2Ch 26:6}  He went out and made war against the Philistines and broke through the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.
{2Ch 26:6}  他出去攻击非利士人，拆毁了迦特城、雅比尼城，和亚实突城；在非利士人中，在亚实突境内，又建筑了些城。
{2Ch 26:7}  God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal and against the Meunites.
{2Ch 26:7}  神帮助他攻击非利士人和住在姑珥巴力的亚拉伯人，并米乌尼人。
{2Ch 26:8}  The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong.
{2Ch 26:8}  亚扪人给乌西雅进贡。他的名声传到埃及，因他甚是强盛。
{2Ch 26:9}  Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them.
{2Ch 26:9}  乌西雅在耶路撒冷的角门和谷门，并城墙转弯之处，建筑城楼，且甚坚固；
{2Ch 26:10} And he built towers in the wilderness and cut out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain, and he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.
{2Ch 26:10} 又在旷野与高原和平原，建筑望楼，挖了许多井，因他的牲畜甚多；又在山地和佳美之地，有农夫和修理葡萄园的人，因为他喜悦农事。
{2Ch 26:11} Moreover, Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's commanders.
{2Ch 26:11} 乌西雅又有军兵，照书记耶利和官长玛西雅所数点的，在王的一个将军哈拿尼雅手下，分队出战。
{2Ch 26:12} The whole number of the heads of fathers' houses of mighty men of valor was 2,600.
{2Ch 26:12} 族长、大能勇士的总数共有二千六百人，
{2Ch 26:13} Under their command was an army of 307,500, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
{2Ch 26:13} 他们手下的军兵共有三十万七千五百人，都有大能，善于争战，帮助王攻击仇敌。
{2Ch 26:14} And Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.
{2Ch 26:14} 乌西雅为全军预备盾牌、枪、盔、甲、弓，和甩石的机弦，
{2Ch 26:15} In Jerusalem he made machines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.
{2Ch 26:15} 又在耶路撒冷使巧匠做机器，安在城楼和角楼上，用以射箭发石。乌西雅的名声传到远方；因为他得了非常的帮助，甚是强盛。
{2Ch 26:16} But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was unfaithful to the LORD his God and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.
{2Ch 26:16} 他既强盛，就心高气傲，以致行事邪僻，干犯耶和华他的神，进耶和华的殿，要在香坛上烧香。
{2Ch 26:17} But Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty priests of the LORD who were men of valor,
{2Ch 26:17} 祭司亚撒利雅率领耶和华勇敢的祭司八十人，跟随他进去。
{2Ch 26:18} and they withstood King Uzziah and said to him, "It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from the LORD God."
{2Ch 26:18} 他们就阻挡乌西雅王，对他说：“乌西雅啊，给耶和华烧香不是你的事，乃是亚伦子孙承接圣职祭司的事。你出圣殿吧！因为你犯了罪。你行这事，耶和华神必不使你得荣耀。”
{2Ch 26:19} Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and when he became angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the LORD, by the altar of incense.
{2Ch 26:19} 乌西雅就发怒，手拿香炉要烧香。他向祭司发怒的时候，在耶和华殿中香坛旁众祭司面前，额上忽然发出大麻疯。
{2Ch 26:20} And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead! And they rushed him out quickly, and he himself hurried to go out, because the LORD had struck him.
{2Ch 26:20} 大祭司亚撒利雅和众祭司观看，见他额上发出大麻疯，就催他出殿；他自己也急速出去，因为耶和华降灾与他。
{2Ch 26:21} And King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death, and being a leper lived in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son was over the king's household, governing the people of the land.
{2Ch 26:21} 乌西雅王长大麻疯直到死日，因此住在别的宫里，与耶和华的殿隔绝。他儿子约坦管理家事，治理国民。
{2Ch 26:22} Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz wrote.
{2Ch 26:22} 乌西雅其余的事，自始至终都是亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚所记的。
{2Ch 26:23} And Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said, "He is a leper." And Jotham his son reigned in his place.
{2Ch 26:23} 乌西雅与他列祖同睡，葬在王陵的田间他列祖的坟地里；因为人说，他是长大麻疯的。他儿子约坦接续他作王。
{2Ch 27:1}  Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
{2Ch 27:1}  约坦登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王十六年，他母亲名叫耶路沙，是撒督的女儿。
{2Ch 27:2}  And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD according to all that his father Uzziah had done, except he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still followed corrupt practices.
{2Ch 27:2}  约坦行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他父乌西雅一切所行的，只是不入耶和华的殿。百姓还行邪僻的事。
{2Ch 27:3}  He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD and did much building on the wall of Ophel.
{2Ch 27:3}  约坦建立耶和华殿的上门，在俄斐勒城上多有建造，
{2Ch 27:4}  Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers on the wooded hills.
{2Ch 27:4}  又在犹大山地建造城邑，在树林中建筑营寨和高楼。
{2Ch 27:5}  He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave him that year 100 talents of silver, and 10,000 cors of wheat and 10,000 of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and the third years.
{2Ch 27:5}  约坦与亚扪人的王打仗胜了他们，当年他们进贡银一百他连得，小麦一万歌珥，大麦一万歌珥；第二年、第三年也是这样。
{2Ch 27:6}  So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.
{2Ch 27:6}  约坦在耶和华他神面前行正道，以致日渐强盛。
{2Ch 27:7}  Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
{2Ch 27:7}  约坦其余的事和一切争战，并他的行为，都写在以色列和犹大列王记上。
{2Ch 27:8}  He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 27:8}  他登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王十六年。
{2Ch 27:9}  And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
{2Ch 27:9}  约坦与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城里。他儿子亚哈斯接续他作王。
{2Ch 28:1}  Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as his father David had done,
{2Ch 28:1}  亚哈斯登基的时候年二十岁，在耶路撒冷作王十六年；不像他祖大卫行耶和华眼中看为正的事，
{2Ch 28:2}  but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made metal images for the Baals,
{2Ch 28:2}  却行以色列诸王的道，又铸造巴力的像，
{2Ch 28:3}  and he made offerings in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom and burned his sons as an offering, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
{2Ch 28:3}  并且在欣嫩子谷烧香，用火焚烧他的儿女，行耶和华在以色列人面前所驱逐的外邦人那可憎的事；
{2Ch 28:4}  And he sacrificed and made offerings on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
{2Ch 28:4}  并在邱坛上、山冈上、各青翠树下献祭烧香。
{2Ch 28:5}  Therefore the LORD his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with great force.
{2Ch 28:5}  所以，耶和华他的神将他交在亚兰王手里。亚兰王打败他，掳了他许多的民，带到大马色去。神又将他交在以色列王手里，以色列王向他大行杀戮。
{2Ch 28:6}  For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 from Judah in one day, all of them men of valor, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.
{2Ch 28:6}  利玛利的儿子比加一日杀了犹大人十二万，都是勇士，因为他们离弃了耶和华他们列祖的神。
{2Ch 28:7}  And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son and Azrikam the commander of the palace and Elkanah the next in authority to the king.
{2Ch 28:7}  有一个以法莲中的勇士，名叫细基利，杀了王的儿子玛西雅和管理王宫的押斯利甘，并宰相以利加拿。
{2Ch 28:8}  The men of Israel took captive 200,000 of their relatives, women, sons, and daughters. They also took much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria.
{2Ch 28:8}  以色列人掳了他们的弟兄，连妇人带儿女共有二十万，又掠了许多的财物，带到撒玛利亚去了。
{2Ch 28:9}  But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded, and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria and said to them, "Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand, but you have killed them in a rage that has reached up to heaven.
{2Ch 28:9}  但那里有耶和华的一个先知，名叫俄德，出来迎接往撒玛利亚去的军兵，对他们说：“因为耶和华你们列祖的神恼怒犹大人，所以将他们交在你们手里，你们竟怒气冲天，大行杀戮。
{2Ch 28:10} And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, as your slaves. Have you not sins of your own against the LORD your God?
{2Ch 28:10} 如今你们又有意强逼犹大人和耶路撒冷人作你们的奴婢，你们岂不也有得罪耶和华你们神的事吗？
{2Ch 28:11} Now hear me, and send back the captives from your relatives whom you have taken, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you."
{2Ch 28:11} 现在你们当听我说，要将掳来的弟兄释放回去，因为耶和华向你们已经大发烈怒。”
{2Ch 28:12} Certain chiefs also of the men of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were coming from the war
{2Ch 28:12} 于是，以法莲人的几个族长，就是约哈难的儿子亚撒利雅、米实利末的儿子比利家、沙龙的儿子耶希西家、哈得莱的儿子亚玛撒起来拦挡出兵回来的人，
{2Ch 28:13} and said to them, "You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose to bring upon us guilt against the LORD in addition to our present sins and guilt. For our guilt is already great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel."
{2Ch 28:13} 对他们说：“你们不可带进这被掳的人来！你们想要使我们得罪耶和华，加增我们的罪恶过犯？因为我们的罪过甚大，已经有烈怒临到以色列人了。”
{2Ch 28:14} So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.
{2Ch 28:14} 于是带兵器的人将掳来的人口和掠来的财物都留在众首领和会众的面前。
{2Ch 28:15} And the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the captives, and with the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them. They clothed them, gave them sandals, provided them with food and drink, and anointed them, and carrying all the feeble among them on donkeys, they brought them to their kinsfolk at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.
{2Ch 28:15} 以上提名的那些人就站起，使被掳的人前来；其中有赤身的，就从所掠的财物中拿出衣服和鞋来，给他们穿，又给他们吃喝，用膏抹他们；其中有软弱的，就使他们骑驴，送到棕树城耶利哥他们弟兄那里；随后就回撒玛利亚去了。
{2Ch 28:16} At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help.
{2Ch 28:16} 那时，亚哈斯王差遣人去见亚述诸王，求他们帮助；
{2Ch 28:17} For the Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and carried away captives.
{2Ch 28:17} 因为以东人又来攻击犹大，掳掠子民。
{2Ch 28:18} And the Philistines had made raids on the cities in the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages. And they settled there.
{2Ch 28:18} 非利士人也来侵占高原和犹大南方的城邑，取了伯示麦、亚雅仑、基低罗，梭哥和属梭哥的乡村，亭纳和属亭纳的乡村，瑾锁和属瑾锁的乡村，就住在那里。
{2Ch 28:19} For the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had made Judah act sinfully and had been very unfaithful to the LORD.
{2Ch 28:19} 因为以色列王亚哈斯在犹大放肆，大大干犯耶和华，所以耶和华使犹大卑微。
{2Ch 28:20} So Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him.
{2Ch 28:20} 亚述王提革拉毗尼色上来，却没有帮助他，反倒欺凌他。
{2Ch 28:21} For Ahaz took a portion from the house of the LORD and the house of the king and of the princes, and gave tribute to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him.
{2Ch 28:21} 亚哈斯从耶和华殿里和王宫中，并首领家内所取的财宝给了亚述王，这也无济于事。
{2Ch 28:22} In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the LORD--this same King Ahaz.
{2Ch 28:22} 这亚哈斯王在急难的时候，越发得罪耶和华。
{2Ch 28:23} For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him and said, "Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me." But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.
{2Ch 28:23} 他祭祀攻击他的大马色之神，说：“因为亚兰王的神帮助他们，我也献祭与他，他好帮助我。”但那些神使他和以色列众人败亡了。
{2Ch 28:24} And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and he shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
{2Ch 28:24} 亚哈斯将神殿里的器皿都聚了来，毁坏了，且封锁耶和华殿的门；在耶路撒冷各处的拐角建筑祭坛，
{2Ch 28:25} In every city of Judah he made high places to make offerings to other gods, provoking to anger the LORD, the God of his fathers.
{2Ch 28:25} 又在犹大各城建立邱坛，与别神烧香，惹动耶和华他列祖神的怒气。
{2Ch 28:26} Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
{2Ch 28:26} 亚哈斯其余的事和他的行为，自始至终都写在犹大和以色列诸王记上。
{2Ch 28:27} And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
{2Ch 28:27} 亚哈斯与他列祖同睡，葬在耶路撒冷城里，没有送入以色列诸王的坟墓中。他儿子希西家接续他作王。
{2Ch 29:1}  Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah.
{2Ch 29:1}  希西家登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十九年。他母亲名叫亚比雅，是撒迦利雅的女儿。
{2Ch 29:2}  And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
{2Ch 29:2}  希西家行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他祖大卫一切所行的。
{2Ch 29:3}  In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them.
{2Ch 29:3}  元年正月，开了耶和华殿的门，重新修理。
{2Ch 29:4}  He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square on the east
{2Ch 29:4}  他召众祭司和利未人来，聚集在东边的宽阔处，
{2Ch 29:5}  and said to them, "Hear me, Levites! Now consecrate yourselves, and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers, and carry out the filth from the Holy Place.
{2Ch 29:5}  对他们说：“利未人哪，当听我说：现在你们要洁净自己，又洁净耶和华你们列祖神的殿，从圣所中除去污秽之物。
{2Ch 29:6}  For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD and turned their backs.
{2Ch 29:6}  我们列祖犯了罪，行耶和华我们神眼中看为恶的事，离弃他，转脸背向他的居所，
{2Ch 29:7}  They also shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel.
{2Ch 29:7}  封锁廊门，吹灭灯火，不在圣所中向以色列神烧香，或献燔祭。
{2Ch 29:8}  Therefore the wrath of the LORD came on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has made them an object of horror, of astonishment, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes.
{2Ch 29:8}  因此，耶和华的忿怒临到犹大和耶路撒冷，将其中的人抛来抛去，令人惊骇、嗤笑，正如你们亲眼所见的。
{2Ch 29:9}  For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
{2Ch 29:9}  所以我们的祖宗倒在刀下，我们的妻子儿女也被掳掠。
{2Ch 29:10} Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, in order that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
{2Ch 29:10} 现在我心中有意与耶和华以色列的神立约，好使他的烈怒转离我们。
{2Ch 29:11} My sons, do not now be negligent, for the LORD has chosen you to stand in his presence, to minister to him and to be his ministers and make offerings to him."
{2Ch 29:11} 我的众子啊，现在不要懈怠；因为耶和华拣选你们站在他面前事奉他，与他烧香。”
{2Ch 29:12} Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;
{2Ch 29:12} 于是，利未人哥辖的子孙、亚玛赛的儿子玛哈，亚撒利雅的儿子约珥；米拉利的子孙、亚伯底的儿子基士，耶哈利勒的儿子亚撒利雅；革顺的子孙、薪玛的儿子约亚，约亚的儿子伊甸；
{2Ch 29:13} and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
{2Ch 29:13} 以利撒反的子孙申利和耶利；亚萨的子孙撒迦利雅和玛探雅；
{2Ch 29:14} and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
{2Ch 29:14} 希幔的子孙耶歇和示每；耶杜顿的子孙示玛雅和乌薛；
{2Ch 29:15} They gathered their brothers and consecrated themselves and went in as the king had commanded, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 29:15} 起来聚集他们的弟兄，洁净自己，照着王的吩咐、耶和华的命令，进去洁净耶和华的殿。
{2Ch 29:16} The priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it and carried it out to the brook Kidron.
{2Ch 29:16} 祭司进入耶和华的殿要洁净殿，将殿中所有污秽之物搬到耶和华殿的院内，利未人接去，搬到外头汲沦溪边。
{2Ch 29:17} They began to consecrate on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the LORD. Then for eight days they consecrated the house of the LORD, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.
{2Ch 29:17} 从正月初一日洁净起，初八日到了耶和华的殿廊，用八日的工夫洁净耶和华的殿，到正月十六日才洁净完了。
{2Ch 29:18} Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said, "We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table for the showbread and all its utensils.
{2Ch 29:18} 于是，他们晋见希西家王，说：“我们已将耶和华的全殿和燔祭坛，并坛的一切器皿、陈设饼的桌子，与桌子的一切器皿都洁净了；
{2Ch 29:19} All the utensils that King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he was faithless, we have made ready and consecrated, and behold, they are before the altar of the LORD."
{2Ch 29:19} 并且亚哈斯王在位犯罪的时候所废弃的器皿，我们预备齐全，且洁净了，现今都在耶和华的坛前。”
{2Ch 29:20} Then Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the officials of the city and went up to the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 29:20} 希西家王清早起来，聚集城里的首领都上耶和华的殿；
{2Ch 29:21} And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
{2Ch 29:21} 牵了七只公牛，七只公羊，七只羊羔，七只公山羊，要为国、为殿、为犹大人作赎罪祭。王吩咐亚伦的子孙众祭司，献在耶和华的坛上，
{2Ch 29:22} So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and threw it against the altar. And they slaughtered the rams, and their blood was thrown against the altar. And they slaughtered the lambs, and their blood was thrown against the altar.
{2Ch 29:22} 就宰了公牛，祭司接血洒在坛上，宰了公羊，把血洒在坛上，又宰了羊羔，也把血洒在坛上；
{2Ch 29:23} Then the goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them,
{2Ch 29:23} 把那作赎罪祭的公山羊牵到王和会众面前，他们就按手在其上。
{2Ch 29:24} and the priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel. For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
{2Ch 29:24} 祭司宰了羊，将血献在坛上作赎罪祭，为以色列众人赎罪，因为王吩咐将燔祭和赎罪祭为以色列众人献上。
{2Ch 29:25} And he stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according to the commandment of David and of Gad the king's seer and of Nathan the prophet, for the commandment was from the LORD through his prophets.
{2Ch 29:25} 王又派利未人在耶和华殿中敲钹，鼓瑟，弹琴，乃照大卫和他先见迦得，并先知拿单所吩咐的，就是耶和华藉先知所吩咐的。
{2Ch 29:26} The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
{2Ch 29:26} 利未人拿大卫的乐器，祭司拿号，一同站立。
{2Ch 29:27} Then Hezekiah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD began also, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel.
{2Ch 29:27} 希西家吩咐在坛上献燔祭，燔祭一献，就唱赞美耶和华的歌，用号，并用以色列王大卫的乐器相和。
{2Ch 29:28} The whole assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
{2Ch 29:28} 会众都敬拜，歌唱的歌唱，吹号的吹号，如此直到燔祭献完了。
{2Ch 29:29} When the offering was finished, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.
{2Ch 29:29} 献完了祭，王和一切跟随的人都俯伏敬拜。
{2Ch 29:30} And Hezekiah the king and the officials commanded the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed down and worshiped.
{2Ch 29:30} 希西家王与众首领又吩咐利未人用大卫和先见亚萨的诗词颂赞耶和华；他们就欢欢喜喜地颂赞耶和华，低头敬拜。
{2Ch 29:31} Then Hezekiah said, "You have now consecrated yourselves to the LORD. Come near; bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD." And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.
{2Ch 29:31} 希西家说：“你们既然归耶和华为圣，就要前来把祭物和感谢祭奉到耶和华殿里。”会众就把祭物和感谢祭奉来，凡甘心乐意的也将燔祭奉来。
{2Ch 29:32} The number of the burnt offerings that the assembly brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
{2Ch 29:32} 会众所奉的燔祭如下：公牛七十只，公羊一百只，羊羔二百只，这都是作燔祭献给耶和华的；
{2Ch 29:33} And the consecrated offerings were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep.
{2Ch 29:33} 又有分别为圣之物，公牛六百只，绵羊三千只。
{2Ch 29:34} But the priests were too few and could not flay all the burnt offerings, so until other priests had consecrated themselves, their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was finished--for the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in consecrating themselves.
{2Ch 29:34} 但祭司太少，不能剥尽燔祭牲的皮，所以他们的弟兄利未人帮助他们，直等燔祭的事完了，又等别的祭司自洁了；因为利未人诚心自洁，胜过祭司。
{2Ch 29:35} Besides the great number of burnt offerings, there was the fat of the peace offerings, and there were the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was restored.
{2Ch 29:35} 燔祭和平安祭牲的脂油，并燔祭同献的奠祭甚多。这样，耶和华殿中的事务俱都齐备了（或作：就整顿了）。
{2Ch 29:36} And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because God had provided for the people, for the thing came about suddenly.
{2Ch 29:36} 这事办的甚速，希西家和众民都喜乐，是因神为众民所预备的。
{2Ch 30:1}  Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to keep the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel.
{2Ch 30:1}  希西家差遣人去见以色列和犹大众人，又写信给以法莲和玛拿西人，叫他们到耶路撒冷耶和华的殿，向耶和华以色列的神守逾越节；
{2Ch 30:2}  For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the Passover in the second month--
{2Ch 30:2}  因为王和众首领，并耶路撒冷全会众已经商议，要在二月内守逾越节。
{2Ch 30:3}  for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem--
{2Ch 30:3}  正月（原文作那时）间他们不能守；因为自洁的祭司尚不敷用，百姓也没有聚集在耶路撒冷；
{2Ch 30:4}  and the plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly.
{2Ch 30:4}  王与全会众都以这事为善。
{2Ch 30:5}  So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem, for they had not kept it as often as prescribed.
{2Ch 30:5}  于是定了命令，传遍以色列，从别是巴直到但，使他们都来，在耶路撒冷向耶和华以色列的神守逾越节；因为照所写的例，守这节的不多了（或作：因为民许久没有照所写的例守节了）。
{2Ch 30:6}  So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying, "O people of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
{2Ch 30:6}  驿卒就把王和众首领的信，遵着王命传遍以色列和犹大。信内说：“以色列人哪，你们当转向耶和华亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列的神，好叫他转向你们这脱离亚述王手的余民。
{2Ch 30:7}  Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were faithless to the LORD God of their fathers, so that he made them a desolation, as you see.
{2Ch 30:7}  你们不要效法你们列祖和你们的弟兄；他们干犯耶和华他们列祖的神，以致耶和华丢弃他们，使他们败亡（或作：令人惊骇），正如你们所见的。
{2Ch 30:8}  Do not now be stiff-necked as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD and come to his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever, and serve the LORD your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
{2Ch 30:8}  现在不要像你们列祖硬着颈项，只要归顺耶和华，进入他的圣所，就是永远成圣的居所；又要事奉耶和华你们的神，好使他的烈怒转离你们。
{2Ch 30:9}  For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and your children will find compassion with their captors and return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him."
{2Ch 30:9}  你们若转向耶和华，你们的弟兄和儿女必在掳掠他们的人面前蒙怜恤，得以归回这地，因为耶和华你们的神有恩典、施怜悯。你们若转向他，他必不转脸不顾你们。”
{2Ch 30:10} So the couriers went from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them.
{2Ch 30:10} 驿卒就由这城跑到那城，传遍了以法莲、玛拿西，直到西布伦。那里的人却戏笑他们，讥诮他们。
{2Ch 30:11} However, some men of Asher, of Manasseh, and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
{2Ch 30:11} 然而亚设、玛拿西、西布伦中也有人自卑，来到耶路撒冷。
{2Ch 30:12} The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the LORD.
{2Ch 30:12} 神也感动犹大人，使他们一心遵行王与众首领凭耶和华之言所发的命令。
{2Ch 30:13} And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
{2Ch 30:13} 二月，有许多人在耶路撒冷聚集，成为大会，要守除酵节。
{2Ch 30:14} They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for burning incense they took away and threw into the brook Kidron.
{2Ch 30:14} 他们起来，把耶路撒冷的祭坛和烧香的坛尽都除去，抛在汲沦溪中。
{2Ch 30:15} And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed, so that they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 30:15} 二月十四日，宰了逾越节的羊羔。祭司与利未人觉得惭愧，就洁净自己，把燔祭奉到耶和华殿中，
{2Ch 30:16} They took their accustomed posts according to the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests threw the blood that they received from the hand of the Levites.
{2Ch 30:16} 遵着神人摩西的律法，照例站在自己的地方；祭司从利未人手里接过血来，洒在坛上。
{2Ch 30:17} For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves. Therefore the Levites had to slaughter the Passover lamb for everyone who was not clean, to consecrate it to the LORD.
{2Ch 30:17} 会中有许多人尚未自洁，所以利未人为一切不洁之人宰逾越节的羊羔，使他们在耶和华面前成为圣洁。
{2Ch 30:18} For a majority of the people, many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than as prescribed. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, "May the good LORD pardon everyone
{2Ch 30:18} (SEE 30:19)
{2Ch 30:19} who sets his heart to seek God, the LORD, the God of his fathers, even though not according to the sanctuary's rules of cleanness."
{2Ch 30:19} 以法莲、玛拿西、以萨迦、西布伦有许多人尚未自洁，他们却也吃逾越节的羊羔，不合所记录的定例。希西家为他们祷告说：“凡专心寻求神，就是耶和华他列祖之神的，虽不照着圣所洁净之礼自洁，求至善的耶和华也饶恕他。”
{2Ch 30:20} And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
{2Ch 30:20} 耶和华垂听希西家的祷告，就饶恕（原文作医治）百姓。
{2Ch 30:21} And the people of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness, and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with all their might to the LORD.
{2Ch 30:21} 在耶路撒冷的以色列人大大喜乐，守除酵节七日。利未人和祭司用响亮的乐器，日日颂赞耶和华。
{2Ch 30:22} And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of the LORD. So they ate the food of the festival for seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
{2Ch 30:22} 希西家慰劳一切善于事奉耶和华的利未人。于是众人吃节筵七日，又献平安祭，且向耶和华他们列祖的神认罪。
{2Ch 30:23} Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the feast for another seven days. So they kept it for another seven days with gladness.
{2Ch 30:23} 全会众商议，要再守节七日；于是欢欢喜喜地又守节七日。
{2Ch 30:24} For Hezekiah king of Judah gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for offerings, and the princes gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep. And the priests consecrated themselves in great numbers.
{2Ch 30:24} 犹大王希西家赐给会众公牛一千只，羊七千只为祭物；众首领也赐给会众公牛一千只，羊一万只，并有许多的祭司洁净自己。
{2Ch 30:25} The whole assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites, and the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and the sojourners who lived in Judah, rejoiced.
{2Ch 30:25} 犹大全会众、祭司、利未人，并那从以色列地来的会众和寄居的人，以及犹大寄居的人，尽都喜乐。
{2Ch 30:26} So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 30:26} 这样，在耶路撒冷大有喜乐，自从以色列王大卫儿子所罗门的时候，在耶路撒冷没有这样的喜乐。
{2Ch 30:27} Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy habitation in heaven.
{2Ch 30:27} 那时，祭司、利未人起来，为民祝福。他们的声音蒙神垂听，他们的祷告达到天上的圣所。
{2Ch 31:1}  Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke in pieces the pillars and cut down the Asherim and broke down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the people of Israel returned to their cities, every man to his possession.
{2Ch 31:1}  这事既都完毕，在那里的以色列众人就到犹大的城邑，打碎柱像，砍断木偶，又在犹大、便雅悯、以法莲、玛拿西遍地将邱坛和祭坛拆毁净尽。于是以色列众人各回各城，各归各地。
{2Ch 31:2}  And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, division by division, each according to his service, the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister in the gates of the camp of the LORD and to give thanks and praise.
{2Ch 31:2}  希西家派定祭司利未人的班次，各按各职献燔祭和平安祭，又在耶和华殿（原文作营）门内事奉，称谢颂赞耶和华。
{2Ch 31:3}  The contribution of the king from his own possessions was for the burnt offerings: the burnt offerings of morning and evening, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed feasts, as it is written in the Law of the LORD.
{2Ch 31:3}  王又从自己的产业中定出分来为燔祭，就是早晚的燔祭和安息日、月朔，并节期的燔祭，都是按耶和华律法上所载的；
{2Ch 31:4}  And he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the Law of the LORD.
{2Ch 31:4}  又吩咐住耶路撒冷的百姓将祭司、利未人所应得的分给他们，使他们专心遵守耶和华的律法。
{2Ch 31:5}  As soon as the command was spread abroad, the people of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field. And they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.
{2Ch 31:5}  谕旨一出，以色列人就把初熟的五谷、新酒、油、蜜，和田地的出产多多送来，又把各物的十分之一送来的极多。
{2Ch 31:6}  And the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of the dedicated things that had been dedicated to the LORD their God, and laid them in heaps.
{2Ch 31:6}  住犹大各城的以色列人和犹大人也将牛羊的十分之一，并分别为圣归耶和华他们神之物，就是十分取一之物，尽都送来，积成堆垒；
{2Ch 31:7}  In the third month they began to pile up the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
{2Ch 31:7}  从三月积起，到七月才完。
{2Ch 31:8}  When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and his people Israel.
{2Ch 31:8}  希西家和众首领来，看见堆垒，就称颂耶和华，又为耶和华的民以色列人祝福。
{2Ch 31:9}  And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps.
{2Ch 31:9}  希西家向祭司、利未人查问这堆垒。
{2Ch 31:10} Azariah the chief priest, who was of the house of Zadok, answered him, "Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the LORD, we have eaten and had enough and have plenty left, for the LORD has blessed his people, so that we have this large amount left."
{2Ch 31:10} 撒督家的大祭司亚撒利雅回答说：“自从民将供物送到耶和华殿以来，我们不但吃饱，且剩下的甚多；因为耶和华赐福给他的民，所剩下的才这样丰盛。”
{2Ch 31:11} Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD, and they prepared them.
{2Ch 31:11} 希西家吩咐在耶和华殿里预备仓房，他们就预备了。
{2Ch 31:12} And they faithfully brought in the contributions, the tithes, and the dedicated things. The chief officer in charge of them was Conaniah the Levite, with Shimei his brother as second,
{2Ch 31:12} 他们诚心将供物和十分取一之物，并分别为圣之物，都搬入仓内。利未人歌楠雅掌管这事，他兄弟示每为副管。
{2Ch 31:13} while Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers assisting Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the chief officer of the house of God.
{2Ch 31:13} 耶歇、亚撒细雅、拿哈、亚撒黑、耶利末、约撒拔、以列、伊斯玛基雅、玛哈、比拿雅都是督理，在歌楠雅和他兄弟示每的手下，是希西家王和管理神殿的亚撒利雅所派的。
{2Ch 31:14} And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the east gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to apportion the contribution reserved for the LORD and the most holy offerings.
{2Ch 31:14} 守东门的利未人音拿的儿子可利，掌管乐意献与神的礼物，发放献与耶和华的供物和至圣的物。
{2Ch 31:15} Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah were faithfully assisting him in the cities of the priests, to distribute the portions to their brothers, old and young alike, by divisions,
{2Ch 31:15} 在他手下有伊甸、泯雅泯、耶书亚、示玛雅、亚玛利雅、示迦尼雅，在祭司的各城里供紧要的职任，无论弟兄大小，都按着班次分给他们。
{2Ch 31:16} except those enrolled by genealogy, males from three years old and upward--all who entered the house of the LORD as the duty of each day required--for their service according to their offices, by their divisions.
{2Ch 31:16} 按家谱，三岁以外的男丁，凡每日进耶和华殿、按班次供职的，也分给他；
{2Ch 31:17} The enrollment of the priests was according to their fathers' houses; that of the Levites from twenty years old and upward was according to their offices, by their divisions.
{2Ch 31:17} 又按宗族家谱分给祭司，按班次职任分给二十岁以外的利未人，
{2Ch 31:18} They were enrolled with all their little children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, the whole assembly, for they were faithful in keeping themselves holy.
{2Ch 31:18} 又按家谱计算，分给他们会中的妻子、儿女；因他们身供要职，自洁成圣。
{2Ch 31:19} And for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields of common land belonging to their cities, there were men in the several cities who were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone among the Levites who was enrolled.
{2Ch 31:19} 按名派定的人要把应得的分给亚伦子孙，住在各城郊野、祭司所有的男丁和一切载入家谱的利未人。
{2Ch 31:20} Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God.
{2Ch 31:20} 希西家在犹大遍地这样办理，行耶和华他神眼中看为善为正为忠的事。
{2Ch 31:21} And every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God and in accordance with the law and the commandments, seeking his God, he did with all his heart, and prospered.
{2Ch 31:21} 凡他所行的，无论是办神殿的事，是遵律法守诫命，是寻求他的神，都是尽心去行，无不亨通。
{2Ch 32:1}  After these things and these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah and encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to win them for himself.
{2Ch 32:1}  这虔诚的事以后，亚述王西拿基立来侵入犹大，围困一切坚固城，想要攻破占据。
{2Ch 32:2}  And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to fight against Jerusalem,
{2Ch 32:2}  希西家见西拿基立来，定意要攻打耶路撒冷，
{2Ch 32:3}  he planned with his officers and his mighty men to stop the water of the springs that were outside the city; and they helped him.
{2Ch 32:3}  就与首领和勇士商议，塞住城外的泉源；他们就都帮助他。
{2Ch 32:4}  A great many people were gathered, and they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land, saying, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?"
{2Ch 32:4}  于是有许多人聚集，塞了一切泉源，并通流国中的小河，说：“亚述王来，为何让他得着许多水呢？”
{2Ch 32:5}  He set to work resolutely and built up all the wall that was broken down and raised towers upon it, and outside it he built another wall, and he strengthened the Millo in the city of David. He also made weapons and shields in abundance.
{2Ch 32:5}  希西家力图自强，就修筑所有拆毁的城墙，高与城楼相齐；在城外又筑一城，坚固大卫城的米罗，制造了许多军器、盾牌；
{2Ch 32:6}  And he set combat commanders over the people and gathered them together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,
{2Ch 32:6}  设立军长管理百姓，将他们招聚在城门的宽阔处，用话勉励他们，说：
{2Ch 32:7}  "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him, for there are more with us than with him.
{2Ch 32:7}  “你们当刚强壮胆，不要因亚述王和跟随他的大军恐惧、惊慌；因为与我们同在的，比与他们同在的更大。
{2Ch 32:8}  With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God, to help us and to fight our battles." And the people took confidence from the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
{2Ch 32:8}  与他们同在的是肉臂，与我们同在的是耶和华我们的神，他必帮助我们，为我们争战”。百姓就靠犹大王希西家的话，安然无惧了。
{2Ch 32:9}  After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria, who was besieging Lachish with all his forces, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,
{2Ch 32:9}  此后，亚述王西拿基立和他的全军攻打拉吉，就差遣臣仆到耶路撒冷见犹大王希西家和一切在耶路撒冷的犹大人，说：
{2Ch 32:10} "Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, 'On what are you trusting, that you endure the siege in Jerusalem?
{2Ch 32:10} “亚述王西拿基立如此说：‘你们倚靠什么，还在耶路撒冷受困呢？
{2Ch 32:11} Is not Hezekiah misleading you, that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, "The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria"?
{2Ch 32:11} 希西家对你们说“耶和华我们的神必救我们脱离亚述王的手”，这不是诱惑你们，使你们受饥渴而死吗？
{2Ch 32:12} Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, "Before one altar you shall worship, and on it you shall burn your sacrifices"?
{2Ch 32:12} 这希西家岂不是废去耶和华的邱坛和祭坛，吩咐犹大与耶路撒冷的人说“你们当在一个坛前敬拜，在其上烧香”吗？
{2Ch 32:13} Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
{2Ch 32:13} 我与我列祖向列邦所行的，你们岂不知道吗？列邦的神何尝能救自己的国脱离我手呢？
{2Ch 32:14} Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers devoted to destruction was able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand?
{2Ch 32:14} 我列祖所灭的国，那些神中谁能救自己的民脱离我手呢？难道你们的神能救你们脱离我手吗？
{2Ch 32:15} Now, therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!'"
{2Ch 32:15} 所以你们不要叫希西家这样欺哄诱惑你们，也不要信他；因为没有一国一邦的神能救自己的民脱离我手和我列祖的手，何况你们的神更不能救你们脱离我的手。’”
{2Ch 32:16} And his servants said still more against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.
{2Ch 32:16} 西拿基立的臣仆还有别的话毁谤耶和华神和他仆人希西家。
{2Ch 32:17} And he wrote letters to cast contempt on the LORD, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, "Like the gods of the nations of the lands who have not delivered their people from my hands, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver his people from my hand."
{2Ch 32:17} 西拿基立也写信毁谤耶和华以色列的神说：“列邦的神既不能救他的民脱离我手，希西家的神也不能救他的民脱离我手了。”
{2Ch 32:18} And they shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, in order that they might take the city.
{2Ch 32:18} 亚述王的臣仆用犹大言语向耶路撒冷城上的民大声呼叫，要惊吓他们，扰乱他们，以便取城。
{2Ch 32:19} And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.
{2Ch 32:19} 他们论耶路撒冷的神，如同论世上人手所造的神一样。
{2Ch 32:20} Then Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this and cried to heaven.
{2Ch 32:20} 希西家王和亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚因此祷告，向天呼求。
{2Ch 32:21} And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he came into the house of his god, some of his own sons struck him down there with the sword.
{2Ch 32:21} 耶和华就差遣一个使者进入亚述王营中，把所有大能的勇士和官长、将帅尽都灭了。亚述王满面含羞地回到本国，进了他神的庙中，有他亲生的儿子在那里用刀杀了他。
{2Ch 32:22} So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies, and he provided for them on every side.
{2Ch 32:22} 这样，耶和华救希西家和耶路撒冷的居民脱离亚述王西拿基立的手，也脱离一切仇敌的手，又赐他们四境平安。
{2Ch 32:23} And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from that time onward.
{2Ch 32:23} 有许多人到耶路撒冷，将供物献与耶和华，又将宝物送给犹大王希西家。此后，希西家在列邦人的眼中看为尊大。
{2Ch 32:24} In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death, and he prayed to the LORD, and he answered him and gave him a sign.
{2Ch 32:24} 那时希西家病得要死，就祷告耶和华，耶和华应允他，赐他一个兆头。
{2Ch 32:25} But Hezekiah did not make return according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was proud. Therefore wrath came upon him and Judah and Jerusalem.
{2Ch 32:25} 希西家却没有照他所蒙的恩报答耶和华；因他心里骄傲，所以忿怒要临到他和犹大并耶路撒冷。
{2Ch 32:26} But Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
{2Ch 32:26} 但希西家和耶路撒冷的居民觉得心里骄傲，就一同自卑，以致耶和华的忿怒在希西家的日子没有临到他们。
{2Ch 32:27} And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made for himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of costly vessels;
{2Ch 32:27} 希西家大有尊荣资财，建造府库，收藏金银、宝石、香料、盾牌，和各样的宝器，
{2Ch 32:28} storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds.
{2Ch 32:28} 又建造仓房，收藏五谷、新酒，和油，又为各类牲畜盖棚立圈；
{2Ch 32:29} He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very great possessions.
{2Ch 32:29} 并且建立城邑，还有许多的羊群牛群，因为神赐他极多的财产。
{2Ch 32:30} This same Hezekiah closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
{2Ch 32:30} 这希西家也塞住基训的上源，引水直下，流在大卫城的西边。希西家所行的事尽都亨通。
{2Ch 32:31} And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the sign that had been done in the land, God left him to himself, in order to test him and to know all that was in his heart.
{2Ch 32:31} 惟有一件事，就是巴比伦王差遣使者来见希西家，访问国中所现的奇事；这件事神离开他，要试验他，好知道他心内如何。
{2Ch 32:32} Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
{2Ch 32:32} 希西家其余的事和他的善行都写在亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚的默示书上和犹大、以色列的诸王记上。
{2Ch 32:33} And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper part of the tombs of the sons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
{2Ch 32:33} 希西家与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫子孙的高陵上。他死的时候，犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民都尊敬他。他儿子玛拿西接续他作王。
{2Ch 33:1}  Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 33:1}  玛拿西登基的时候年十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王五十五年。
{2Ch 33:2}  And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
{2Ch 33:2}  他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法耶和华在以色列人面前赶出的外邦人那可憎的事，
{2Ch 33:3}  For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had broken down, and he erected altars to the Baals, and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
{2Ch 33:3}  重新建筑他父希西家所拆毁的邱坛，又为巴力筑坛，做木偶，且敬拜事奉天上的万象，
{2Ch 33:4}  And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem shall my name be forever."
{2Ch 33:4}  在耶和华的殿宇中筑坛，耶和华曾指着这殿说：“我的名必永远在耶路撒冷。”
{2Ch 33:5}  And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 33:5}  他在耶和华殿的两院中为天上的万象筑坛，
{2Ch 33:6}  And he burned his sons as an offering in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and used fortune-telling and omens and sorcery, and dealt with mediums and with necromancers. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
{2Ch 33:6}  并在欣嫩子谷使他的儿女经火，又观兆，用法术，行邪术，立交鬼的和行巫术的，多行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，惹动他的怒气，
{2Ch 33:7}  And the carved image of the idol that he had made he set in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever,
{2Ch 33:7}  又在神殿内立雕刻的偶像。神曾对大卫和他儿子所罗门说：“我在以色列各支派中所选择的耶路撒冷和这殿，必立我的名直到永远。
{2Ch 33:8}  and I will no more remove the foot of Israel from the land that I appointed for your fathers, if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them, all the law, the statutes, and the rules given through Moses."
{2Ch 33:8}  以色列人若谨守遵行我藉摩西所吩咐他们的一切法度、律例、典章，我就不再使他们挪移离开我所赐给他们列祖之地。”
{2Ch 33:9}  Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the people of Israel.
{2Ch 33:9}  玛拿西引诱犹大和耶路撒冷的居民，以致他们行恶比耶和华在以色列人面前所灭的列国更甚。
{2Ch 33:10} The LORD spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they paid no attention.
{2Ch 33:10} 耶和华警戒玛拿西和他的百姓，他们却是不听。
{2Ch 33:11} Therefore the LORD brought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh with hooks and bound him with chains of bronze and brought him to Babylon.
{2Ch 33:11} 所以耶和华使亚述王的将帅来攻击他们，用铙钩钩住玛拿西，用铜链锁住他，带到巴比伦去。
{2Ch 33:12} And when he was in distress, he entreated the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
{2Ch 33:12} 他在急难的时候，就恳求耶和华他的神，且在他列祖的神面前极其自卑。
{2Ch 33:13} He prayed to him, and God was moved by his entreaty and heard his plea and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God.
{2Ch 33:13} 他祈祷耶和华，耶和华就允准他的祈求，垂听他的祷告，使他归回耶路撒冷，仍坐国位。玛拿西这才知道惟独耶和华是神。
{2Ch 33:14} Afterward he built an outer wall for the city of David west of Gihon, in the valley, and for the entrance into the Fish Gate, and carried it around Ophel, and raised it to a very great height. He also put commanders of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah.
{2Ch 33:14} 此后，玛拿西在大卫城外，从谷内基训西边直到鱼门口，建筑城墙，环绕俄斐勒，这墙筑得甚高；又在犹大各坚固城内设立勇敢的军长；
{2Ch 33:15} And he took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built on the mountain of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside of the city.
{2Ch 33:15} 并除掉外邦人的神像与耶和华殿中的偶像，又将他在耶和华殿的山上和耶路撒冷所筑的各坛都拆毁抛在城外；
{2Ch 33:16} He also restored the altar of the LORD and offered on it sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving, and he commanded Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.
{2Ch 33:16} 重修耶和华的祭坛，在坛上献平安祭、感谢祭，吩咐犹大人事奉耶和华以色列的神。
{2Ch 33:17} Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.
{2Ch 33:17} 百姓却仍在邱坛上献祭，只献给耶和华他们的神。
{2Ch 33:18} Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, behold, they are in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
{2Ch 33:18} 玛拿西其余的事和祷告他神的话，并先见奉耶和华以色列神的名警戒他的言语，都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ch 33:19} And his prayer, and how God was moved by his entreaty, and all his sin and his faithlessness, and the sites on which he built high places and set up the Asherim and the images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the Chronicles of the Seers.
{2Ch 33:19} 他的祷告，与神怎样应允他，他未自卑以前的罪愆过犯，并在何处建筑邱坛，设立亚舍拉和雕刻的偶像，都写在何赛的书上。
{2Ch 33:20} So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his house, and Amon his son reigned in his place.
{2Ch 33:20} 玛拿西与他列祖同睡，葬在自己的宫院里。他儿子亚们接续他作王。
{2Ch 33:21} Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 33:21} 亚们登基的时候年二十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王二年。
{2Ch 33:22} And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done. Amon sacrificed to all the images that Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
{2Ch 33:22} 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法他父玛拿西所行的，祭祀事奉他父玛拿西所雕刻的偶像，
{2Ch 33:23} And he did not humble himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself, but this Amon incurred guilt more and more.
{2Ch 33:23} 不在耶和华面前像他父玛拿西自卑。这亚们所犯的罪越犯越大。
{2Ch 33:24} And his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his house.
{2Ch 33:24} 他的臣仆背叛，在宫里杀了他。
{2Ch 33:25} But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon. And the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
{2Ch 33:25} 但国民杀了那些背叛亚们王的人，立他儿子约西亚接续他作王。
{2Ch 34:1}  Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 34:1}  约西亚登基的时候年八岁，在耶路撒冷作王三十一年。
{2Ch 34:2}  And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father; and he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
{2Ch 34:2}  他行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他祖大卫所行的，不偏左右。
{2Ch 34:3}  For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet a boy, he began to seek the God of David his father, and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherim, and the carved and the metal images.
{2Ch 34:3}  他作王第八年，尚且年幼，就寻求他祖大卫的神。到了十二年才洁净犹大和耶路撒冷，除掉邱坛、木偶、雕刻的像，和铸造的像。
{2Ch 34:4}  And they chopped down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and he cut down the incense altars that stood above them. And he broke in pieces the Asherim and the carved and the metal images, and he made dust of them and scattered it over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
{2Ch 34:4}  众人在他面前拆毁巴力的坛，砍断坛上高高的日像，又把木偶和雕刻的像，并铸造的像打碎成灰，撒在祭偶像人的坟上，
{2Ch 34:5}  He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
{2Ch 34:5}  将他们祭司的骸骨烧在坛上，洁净了犹大和耶路撒冷；
{2Ch 34:6}  And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, in their ruins all around,
{2Ch 34:6}  又在玛拿西、以法莲、西缅、拿弗他利各城，和四围破坏之处，都这样行；
{2Ch 34:7}  he broke down the altars and beat the Asherim and the images into powder and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
{2Ch 34:7}  又拆毁祭坛，把木偶和雕刻的像打碎成灰，砍断以色列遍地所有的日像，就回耶路撒冷去了。
{2Ch 34:8}  Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had cleansed the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
{2Ch 34:8}  约西亚王十八年，净地净殿之后，就差遣亚萨利雅的儿子沙番、邑宰玛西雅、约哈斯的儿子史官约亚去修理耶和华他神的殿。
{2Ch 34:9}  They came to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim and from all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{2Ch 34:9}  他们就去见大祭司希勒家，将奉到神殿的银子交给他；这银子是看守殿门的利未人从玛拿西、以法莲，和一切以色列剩下的人，以及犹大、便雅悯众人，并耶路撒冷的居民收来的。
{2Ch 34:10} And they gave it to the workmen who were working in the house of the LORD. And the workmen who were working in the house of the LORD gave it for repairing and restoring the house.
{2Ch 34:10} 又将这银子交给耶和华殿里督工的，转交修理耶和华殿的工匠，
{2Ch 34:11} They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone, and timber for binders and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had let go to ruin.
{2Ch 34:11} 就是交给木匠、石匠，买凿成的石头和架木与栋梁，修犹大王所毁坏的殿。
{2Ch 34:12} And the men did the work faithfully. Over them were set Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to have oversight. The Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music,
{2Ch 34:12} 这些人办事诚实，督工的是利未人米拉利的子孙雅哈、俄巴底；督催的是哥辖的子孙撒迦利亚、米书兰；还有善于作乐的利未人。
{2Ch 34:13} were over the burden-bearers and directed all who did work in every kind of service, and some of the Levites were scribes and officials and gatekeepers.
{2Ch 34:13} 他们又监管扛抬的人，督催一切做工的。利未人中也有作书记、作司事、作守门的。
{2Ch 34:14} While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD given through Moses.
{2Ch 34:14} 他们将奉到耶和华殿的银子运出来的时候，祭司希勒家偶然得了摩西所传耶和华的律法书。
{2Ch 34:15} Then Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD." And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.
{2Ch 34:15} 希勒家对书记沙番说：“我在耶和华殿里得了律法书。”遂将书递给沙番。
{2Ch 34:16} Shaphan brought the book to the king, and further reported to the king, "All that was committed to your servants they are doing.
{2Ch 34:16} 沙番把书拿到王那里，回覆王说：“凡交给仆人们办的都办理了。
{2Ch 34:17} They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have given it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen."
{2Ch 34:17} 耶和华殿里的银子倒出来，交给督工的和匠人的手里了。”
{2Ch 34:18} Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read from it before the king.
{2Ch 34:18} 书记沙番又对王说：“祭司希勒家递给我一卷书。”沙番就在王面前读那书。
{2Ch 34:19} And when the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his clothes.
{2Ch 34:19} 王听见律法上的话，就撕裂衣服，
{2Ch 34:20} And the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,
{2Ch 34:20} 吩咐希勒家与沙番的儿子亚希甘、米迦的儿子亚比顿、书记沙番，和王的臣仆亚撒雅说：
{2Ch 34:21} "Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book."
{2Ch 34:21} “你们去为我、为以色列和犹大剩下的人，以这书上的话求问耶和华；因我们列祖没有遵守耶和华的言语，没有照这书上所记的去行，耶和华的烈怒就倒在我们身上。”
{2Ch 34:22} So Hilkiah and those whom the king had sent went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter) and spoke to her to that effect.
{2Ch 34:22} 于是，希勒家和王所派的众人都去见女先知户勒大。户勒大是掌管礼服沙龙的妻，沙龙是哈斯拉的孙子、特瓦的儿子。户勒大住在耶路撒冷第二区；他们请问于他。
{2Ch 34:23} And she said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: 'Tell the man who sent you to me,
{2Ch 34:23} 他对他们说：“耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘你们可以回覆那差遣你们来见我的人说，
{2Ch 34:24} Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book that was read before the king of Judah.
{2Ch 34:24} 耶和华如此说：我必照着在犹大王面前所读那书上的一切咒诅，降祸与这地和其上的居民；
{2Ch 34:25} Because they have forsaken me and have made offerings to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.
{2Ch 34:25} 因为他们离弃我，向别神烧香，用他们手所做的惹我发怒，所以我的忿怒如火倒在这地上，总不息灭。’
{2Ch 34:26} But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding the words that you have heard,
{2Ch 34:26} 然而差遣你们来求问耶和华的犹大王，你们要这样回覆他说：‘耶和华以色列的神如此说：至于你所听见的话，
{2Ch 34:27} because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and you have humbled yourself before me and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the LORD.
{2Ch 34:27} 就是听见我指着这地和其上居民所说的话，你便心里敬服，在我面前自卑，撕裂衣服，向我哭泣，因此我应允了你。这是我耶和华说的。
{2Ch 34:28} Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants.'" And they brought back word to the king.
{2Ch 34:28} 我必使你平平安安的归到坟墓，到你列祖那里，我要降与这地和其上居民的一切灾祸，你也不至亲眼看见。’”他们就回覆王去了。
{2Ch 34:29} Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
{2Ch 34:29} 王差遣人招聚犹大和耶路撒冷的众长老来。
{2Ch 34:30} And the king went up to the house of the LORD, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites, all the people both great and small. And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 34:30} 王和犹大众人，与耶路撒冷的居民，并祭司利未人，以及所有的百姓，无论大小，都一同上到耶和华的殿；王就把殿里所得的约书念给他们听。
{2Ch 34:31} And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
{2Ch 34:31} 王站在他的地位上，在耶和华面前立约，要尽心尽性地顺从耶和华，遵守他的诫命、法度、律例，成就这书上所记的约言；
{2Ch 34:32} Then he made all who were present in Jerusalem and in Benjamin join in it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
{2Ch 34:32} 又使住耶路撒冷和便雅悯的人都服从这约。于是耶路撒冷的居民都遵行他们列祖之神的约。
{2Ch 34:33} And Josiah took away all the abominations from all the territory that belonged to the people of Israel and made all who were present in Israel serve the LORD their God. All his days they did not turn away from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
{2Ch 34:33} 约西亚从以色列各处将一切可憎之物尽都除掉，使以色列境内的人都事奉耶和华他们的神。约西亚在世的日子，就跟从耶和华他们列祖的神，总不离开。
{2Ch 35:1}  Josiah kept a Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem. And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.
{2Ch 35:1}  约西亚在耶路撒冷向耶和华守逾越节。正月十四日，就宰了逾越节的羊羔。
{2Ch 35:2}  He appointed the priests to their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD.
{2Ch 35:2}  王分派祭司各尽其职，又勉励他们办耶和华殿中的事；
{2Ch 35:3}  And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy to the LORD, "Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. You need not carry it on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.
{2Ch 35:3}  又对那归耶和华为圣、教训以色列人的利未人说：“你们将圣约柜安放在以色列王大卫儿子所罗门建造的殿里，不必再用肩扛抬。现在要事奉耶和华你们的神，服事他的民以色列。
{2Ch 35:4}  Prepare yourselves according to your fathers' houses by your divisions, as prescribed in the writing of David king of Israel and the document of Solomon his son.
{2Ch 35:4}  你们应当按着宗族，照着班次，遵以色列王大卫和他儿子所罗门所写的，自己预备。
{2Ch 35:5}  And stand in the Holy Place according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of your brothers the lay people, and according to the division of the Levites by fathers' household.
{2Ch 35:5}  要按着你们的弟兄，这民宗族的班次，站在圣所，每班中要利未宗族的几个人。
{2Ch 35:6}  And slaughter the Passover lamb, and consecrate yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of the LORD by Moses."
{2Ch 35:6}  要宰逾越节的羊羔，洁净自己，为你们的弟兄预备了，好遵守耶和华藉摩西所吩咐的话。”
{2Ch 35:7}  Then Josiah contributed to the lay people, as Passover offerings for all who were present, lambs and young goats from the flock to the number of 30,000, and 3,000 bulls; these were from the king's possessions.
{2Ch 35:7}  约西亚从群畜中赐给在那里所有的人民，绵羊羔和山羊羔三万只，牛三千只，作逾越节的祭物；这都是出自王的产业中。
{2Ch 35:8}  And his officials contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chief officers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings 2,600 Passover lambs and 300 bulls.
{2Ch 35:8}  约西亚的众首领也乐意将牺牲给百姓和祭司利未人；又有管理神殿的希勒家、撒迦利亚、耶歇将羊羔二千六百只，牛三百只，给祭司作逾越节的祭物。
{2Ch 35:9}  Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings 5,000 lambs and young goats and 500 bulls.
{2Ch 35:9}  利未人的族长歌楠雅和他两个兄弟示玛雅、拿坦业，与哈沙比雅、耶利、约撒拔将羊羔五千只，牛五百只，给利未人作逾越节的祭物。
{2Ch 35:10} When the service had been prepared for, the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions according to the king's command.
{2Ch 35:10} 这样，供献的事齐备了。祭司站在自己的地方，利未人按着班次站立，都是照王所吩咐的。
{2Ch 35:11} And they slaughtered the Passover lamb, and the priests threw the blood that they received from them while the Levites flayed the sacrifices.
{2Ch 35:11} 利未人宰了逾越节的羊羔，祭司从他们手里接过血来洒在坛上；利未人剥皮，
{2Ch 35:12} And they set aside the burnt offerings that they might distribute them according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of the lay people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the Book of Moses. And so they did with the bulls.
{2Ch 35:12} 将燔祭搬来，按着宗族的班次分给众民，好照摩西书上所写的，献给耶和华；献牛也是这样。
{2Ch 35:13} And they roasted the Passover lamb with fire according to the rule; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the lay people.
{2Ch 35:13} 他们按着常例，用火烤逾越节的羊羔。别的圣物用锅，用釜，用罐煮了，速速地送给众民。
{2Ch 35:14} And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were offering the burnt offerings and the fat parts until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
{2Ch 35:14} 然后为自己和祭司预备祭物；因为祭司亚伦的子孙献燔祭和脂油，直到晚上。所以利未人为自己和祭司亚伦的子孙，预备祭物。
{2Ch 35:15} The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the gatekeepers were at each gate. They did not need to depart from their service, for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.
{2Ch 35:15} 歌唱的亚萨之子孙，照着大卫、亚萨、希幔，和王的先见耶杜顿所吩咐的，站在自己的地位上。守门的看守各门，不用离开他们的职事，因为他们的弟兄利未人给他们预备祭物。
{2Ch 35:16} So all the service of the LORD was prepared that day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josiah.
{2Ch 35:16} 当日，供奉耶和华的事齐备了，就照约西亚王的吩咐守逾越节，献燔祭在耶和华的坛上。
{2Ch 35:17} And the people of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days.
{2Ch 35:17} 当时在耶路撒冷的以色列人守逾越节，又守除酵节七日。
{2Ch 35:18} No Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as was kept by Josiah, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{2Ch 35:18} 自从先知撒母耳以来，在以色列中没有守过这样的逾越节，以色列诸王也没有守过，像约西亚、祭司、利未人、在那里的犹大人，和以色列人，以及耶路撒冷居民所守的逾越节。
{2Ch 35:19} In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.
{2Ch 35:19} 这逾越节是约西亚作王十八年守的。
{2Ch 35:20} After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to meet him.
{2Ch 35:20} 这事以后，约西亚修完了殿，有埃及王尼哥上来，要攻击靠近伯拉河的迦基米施；约西亚出去抵挡他。
{2Ch 35:21} But he sent envoys to him, saying, "What have we to do with each other, king of Judah? I am not coming against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war. And God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, lest he destroy you."
{2Ch 35:21} 他差遣使者来见约西亚，说：“犹大王啊，我与你何干？我今日来不是要攻击你，乃是要攻击与我争战之家，并且神吩咐我速行，你不要干预神的事，免得他毁灭你，因为神是与我同在。”
{2Ch 35:22} Nevertheless, Josiah did not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to fight in the plain of Megiddo.
{2Ch 35:22} 约西亚却不肯转去离开他，改装要与他打仗，不听从神藉尼哥之口所说的话，便来到米吉多平原争战。
{2Ch 35:23} And the archers shot King Josiah. And the king said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am badly wounded."
{2Ch 35:23} 弓箭手射中约西亚王。王对他的臣仆说：“我受了重伤，你拉我出阵吧！”
{2Ch 35:24} So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
{2Ch 35:24} 他的臣仆扶他下了战车，上了次车，送他到耶路撒冷，他就死了，葬在他列祖的坟墓里。犹大人和耶路撒冷人都为他悲哀。
{2Ch 35:25} Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiah; and all the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josiah in their laments to this day. They made these a rule in Israel; behold, they are written in the Laments.
{2Ch 35:25} 耶利米为约西亚作哀歌。所有歌唱的男女也唱哀歌，追悼约西亚，直到今日；而且在以色列中成了定例。这歌载在哀歌书上。
{2Ch 35:26} Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds according to what is written in the Law of the LORD,
{2Ch 35:26} 约西亚其余的事和他遵着耶和华律法上所记而行的善事，
{2Ch 35:27} and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
{2Ch 35:27} 并他自始至终所行的，都写在以色列和犹大列王记上。
{2Ch 36:1}  The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and made him king in his father's place in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 36:1}  国民立约西亚的儿子约哈斯在耶路撒冷接续他父作王。
{2Ch 36:2}  Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 36:2}  约哈斯登基的时候年二十三岁，在耶路撒冷作王三个月。
{2Ch 36:3}  Then the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and laid on the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
{2Ch 36:3}  埃及王在耶路撒冷废了他，又罚犹大国银子一百他连得，金子一他连得。
{2Ch 36:4}  And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz his brother and carried him to Egypt.
{2Ch 36:4}  埃及王尼哥立约哈斯的哥哥以利雅敬作犹大和耶路撒冷的王，改名叫约雅敬，又将约哈斯带到埃及去了。
{2Ch 36:5}  Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
{2Ch 36:5}  约雅敬登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王十一年，行耶和华他神眼中看为恶的事。
{2Ch 36:6}  Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon.
{2Ch 36:6}  巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒上来攻击他，用铜链锁着他，要将他带到巴比伦去。
{2Ch 36:7}  Nebuchadnezzar also carried part of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon and put them in his palace in Babylon.
{2Ch 36:7}  尼布甲尼撒又将耶和华殿里的器皿带到巴比伦，放在他神的庙里（或作：自己的宫里）。
{2Ch 36:8}  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and the abominations that he did, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
{2Ch 36:8}  约雅敬其余的事和他所行可憎的事，并他一切的行为，都写在以色列和犹大列王记上。他儿子约雅斤接续他作王。
{2Ch 36:9}  Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
{2Ch 36:9}  约雅斤登基的时候年八岁（在列王下二十四章八节是十八岁），在耶路撒冷作王三个月零十天，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。
{2Ch 36:10} In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the LORD, and made his brother Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.
{2Ch 36:10} 过了一年，尼布甲尼撒差遣人将约雅斤和耶和华殿里各样宝贵的器皿带到巴比伦，就立约雅斤的叔叔（原文作兄）西底家作犹大和耶路撒冷的王。
{2Ch 36:11} Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 36:11} 西底家登基的时候年二十一岁，在耶路撒冷作王十一年，
{2Ch 36:12} He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the LORD.
{2Ch 36:12} 行耶和华他神眼中看为恶的事。先知耶利米以耶和华的话劝他，他仍不在耶利米面前自卑。
{2Ch 36:13} He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD, the God of Israel.
{2Ch 36:13} 尼布甲尼撒曾使他指着神起誓，他却背叛，强项硬心，不归服耶和华以色列的神。
{2Ch 36:14} All the officers of the priests and the people likewise were exceedingly unfaithful, following all the abominations of the nations. And they polluted the house of the LORD that he had made holy in Jerusalem.
{2Ch 36:14} 众祭司长和百姓也大大犯罪，效法外邦人一切可憎的事，污秽耶和华在耶路撒冷分别为圣的殿。
{2Ch 36:15} The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent persistently to them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place.
{2Ch 36:15} 耶和华他们列祖的神因为爱惜自己的民和他的居所，从早起来差遣使者去警戒他们。
{2Ch 36:16} But they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words and scoffing at his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD rose against his people, until there was no remedy.
{2Ch 36:16} 他们却嘻笑神的使者，藐视他的言语，讥诮他的先知，以致耶和华的忿怒向他的百姓发作，无法可救。
{2Ch 36:17} Therefore he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or aged. He gave them all into his hand.
{2Ch 36:17} 所以，耶和华使迦勒底人的王来攻击他们，在他们圣殿里用刀杀了他们的壮丁，不怜恤他们的少男处女、老人白叟。耶和华将他们都交在迦勒底王手里。
{2Ch 36:18} And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.
{2Ch 36:18} 迦勒底王将神殿里的大小器皿与耶和华殿里的财宝，并王和众首领的财宝，都带到巴比伦去了。
{2Ch 36:19} And they burned the house of God and broke down the wall of Jerusalem and burned all its palaces with fire and destroyed all its precious vessels.
{2Ch 36:19} 迦勒底人焚烧神的殿，拆毁耶路撒冷的城墙，用火烧了城里的宫殿，毁坏了城里宝贵的器皿。
{2Ch 36:20} He took into exile in Babylon those who had escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and to his sons until the establishment of the kingdom of Persia,
{2Ch 36:20} 凡脱离刀剑的，迦勒底王都掳到巴比伦去，作他和他子孙的仆婢，直到波斯国兴起来。
{2Ch 36:21} to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days that it lay desolate it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
{2Ch 36:21} 这就应验耶和华藉耶利米口所说的话：地享受安息；因为地土荒凉便守安息，直满了七十年。
{2Ch 36:22} Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:
{2Ch 36:22} 波斯王古列元年，耶和华为要应验藉耶利米口所说的话，就激动波斯王古列的心，使他下诏通告全国，说：
{2Ch 36:23} "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, 'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may the LORD his God be with him. Let him go up.'"
{2Ch 36:23} “波斯王古列如此说：耶和华天上的神已将天下万国赐给我，又嘱咐我在犹大的耶路撒冷为他建造殿宇。你们中间凡作他子民的，可以上去，愿耶和华他的神与他同在。”
