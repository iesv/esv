{Jdg 1:1}   After the death of Joshua, the people of Israel inquired of the LORD, "Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?"
{Jdg 1:1}   约书亚死后，以色列人求问耶和华说：“我们中间谁当首先上去攻击迦南人，与他们争战？”
{Jdg 1:2}   The LORD said, "Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand."
{Jdg 1:2}   耶和华说：“犹大当先上去，我已将那地交在他手中。”
{Jdg 1:3}   And Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites. And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you." So Simeon went with him.
{Jdg 1:3}   犹大对他哥哥西缅说：“请你同我到拈阄所得之地去，好与迦南人争战；以后我也同你到你拈阄所得之地去。”于是西缅与他同去。
{Jdg 1:4}   Then Judah went up and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated 10,000 of them at Bezek.
{Jdg 1:4}   犹大就上去；耶和华将迦南人和比利洗人交在他们手中。他们在比色击杀了一万人，
{Jdg 1:5}   They found Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
{Jdg 1:5}   又在那里遇见亚多尼比色，与他争战，杀败迦南人和比利洗人。
{Jdg 1:6}   Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.
{Jdg 1:6}   亚多尼比色逃跑；他们追赶，拿住他，砍断他手脚的大姆指。
{Jdg 1:7}   And Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me." And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
{Jdg 1:7}   亚多尼比色说：“从前有七十个王，手脚的大姆指都被我砍断，在我桌子底下拾取零碎食物。现在神按着我所行的报应我了。”于是他们将亚多尼比色带到耶路撒冷，他就死在那里。
{Jdg 1:8}   And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
{Jdg 1:8}   犹大人攻打耶路撒冷，将城攻取，用刀杀了城内的人，并且放火烧城。
{Jdg 1:9}   And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland.
{Jdg 1:9}   后来犹大人下去，与住山地、南地，和高原的迦南人争战。
{Jdg 1:10}  And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
{Jdg 1:10}  犹大人去攻击住希伯仑的迦南人，杀了示筛、亚希幔、挞买。希伯仑从前名叫基列亚巴。
{Jdg 1:11}  From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher.
{Jdg 1:11}  他们从那里去攻击底壁的居民；底壁从前名叫基列西弗。
{Jdg 1:12}  And Caleb said, "He who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter for a wife."
{Jdg 1:12}  迦勒说：“谁能攻打基列西弗，将城夺取，我就把我女儿押撒给他为妻。”
{Jdg 1:13}  And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
{Jdg 1:13}  迦勒兄弟基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂夺取了那城，迦勒就把女儿押撒给他为妻。
{Jdg 1:14}  When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"
{Jdg 1:14}  押撒过门的时候，劝丈夫向他父亲求一块田。押撒一下驴，迦勒问他说：“你要什么？”
{Jdg 1:15}  She said to him, "Give me a blessing. Since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water." And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
{Jdg 1:15}  他说：“求你赐福给我，你既将我安置在南地，求你也给我水泉。”迦勒就把上泉下泉赐给他。
{Jdg 1:16}  And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad, and they went and settled with the people.
{Jdg 1:16}  摩西的内兄（或作：岳父）是基尼人，他的子孙与犹大人一同离了棕树城，往亚拉得以南的犹大旷野去，就住在民中。
{Jdg 1:17}  And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction. So the name of the city was called Hormah.
{Jdg 1:17}  犹大和他哥哥西缅同去，击杀了住洗法的迦南人，将城尽行毁灭，那城的名便叫何珥玛。
{Jdg 1:18}  Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.
{Jdg 1:18}  犹大又取了迦萨和迦萨的四境，亚实基伦和亚实基伦的四境，以革伦和以革伦的四境。
{Jdg 1:19}  And the LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had chariots of iron.
{Jdg 1:19}  耶和华与犹大同在，犹大就赶出山地的居民，只是不能赶出平原的居民，因为他们有铁车。
{Jdg 1:20}  And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said. And he drove out from it the three sons of Anak.
{Jdg 1:20}  以色列人照摩西所说的，将希伯仑给了迦勒；迦勒就从那里赶出亚衲族的三个族长。
{Jdg 1:21}  But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
{Jdg 1:21}  便雅悯人没有赶出住耶路撒冷的耶布斯人。耶布斯人仍在耶路撒冷与便雅悯人同住，直到今日。
{Jdg 1:22}  The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
{Jdg 1:22}  约瑟家也上去攻打伯特利；耶和华与他们同在。
{Jdg 1:23}  And the house of Joseph scouted out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.)
{Jdg 1:23}  约瑟家打发人去窥探伯特利（那城起先名叫路斯）。
{Jdg 1:24}  And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, "Please show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you."
{Jdg 1:24}  窥探的人看见一个人从城里出来，就对他说：“求你将进城的路指示我们，我们必恩待你。”
{Jdg 1:25}  And he showed them the way into the city. And they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go.
{Jdg 1:25}  那人将进城的路指示他们，他们就用刀击杀了城中的居民，但将那人和他全家放去。
{Jdg 1:26}  And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and called its name Luz. That is its name to this day.
{Jdg 1:26}  那人往赫人之地去，筑了一座城，起名叫路斯。那城到如今还叫这名。
{Jdg 1:27}  Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages, for the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.
{Jdg 1:27}  玛拿西没有赶出伯善和属伯善乡村的居民，他纳和属他纳乡村的居民，多珥和属多珥乡村的居民，以伯莲和属以伯莲乡村的居民，米吉多和属米吉多乡村的居民；迦南人却执意住在那些地方。
{Jdg 1:28}  When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not drive them out completely.
{Jdg 1:28}  及至以色列强盛了，就使迦南人做苦工，没有把他们全然赶出。
{Jdg 1:29}  And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
{Jdg 1:29}  以法莲没有赶出住基色的迦南人。于是迦南人仍住在基色，在以法莲中间。
{Jdg 1:30}  Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them, but became subject to forced labor.
{Jdg 1:30}  西布伦没有赶出基伦的居民和拿哈拉的居民。于是迦南人仍住在西布伦中间，成了服苦的人。
{Jdg 1:31}  Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob,
{Jdg 1:31}  亚设没有赶出亚柯和西顿的居民，亚黑拉和亚革悉的居民，黑巴、亚弗革与利合的居民。
{Jdg 1:32}  so the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.
{Jdg 1:32}  于是，亚设因为没有赶出那地的迦南人，就住在他们中间。
{Jdg 1:33}  Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, so they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.
{Jdg 1:33}  拿弗他利没有赶出伯示麦和伯亚纳的居民，于是拿弗他利就住在那地的迦南人中间；然而伯示麦和伯亚纳的居民成了服苦的人。
{Jdg 1:34}  The Amorites pressed the people of Dan back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain.
{Jdg 1:34}  亚摩利人强逼但人住在山地，不容他们下到平原；
{Jdg 1:35}  The Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor.
{Jdg 1:35}  亚摩利人却执意住在希烈山和亚雅伦并沙宾。然而约瑟家胜了他们，使他们成了服苦的人。
{Jdg 1:36}  And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.
{Jdg 1:36}  亚摩利人的境界，是从亚克拉滨坡，从西拉而上。
{Jdg 2:1}   Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, "I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you,
{Jdg 2:1}   耶和华的使者从吉甲上到波金，对以色列人说：“我使你们从埃及上来，领你们到我向你们列祖起誓应许之地。我又说：‘我永不废弃与你们所立的约。
{Jdg 2:2}   and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.' But you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done?
{Jdg 2:2}   你们也不可与这地的居民立约，要拆毁他们的祭坛。你们竟没有听从我的话！为何这样行呢？’
{Jdg 2:3}   So now I say, I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you."
{Jdg 2:3}   因此我又说：‘我必不将他们从你们面前赶出；他们必作你们肋下的荆棘。他们的神必作你们的网罗。’”
{Jdg 2:4}   As soon as the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.
{Jdg 2:4}   耶和华的使者向以色列众人说这话的时候，百姓就放声而哭；
{Jdg 2:5}   And they called the name of that place Bochim. And they sacrificed there to the LORD.
{Jdg 2:5}   于是给那地方起名叫波金（就是哭的意思）。众人在那里向耶和华献祭。
{Jdg 2:6}   When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land.
{Jdg 2:6}   从前约书亚打发以色列百姓去的时候，他们各归自己的地业，占据地土。
{Jdg 2:7}   And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the LORD had done for Israel.
{Jdg 2:7}   约书亚在世和约书亚死后，那些见耶和华为以色列人所行大事的长老还在的时候，百姓都事奉耶和华。
{Jdg 2:8}   And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110 years.
{Jdg 2:8}   耶和华的仆人、嫩的儿子约书亚，正一百一十岁就死了。
{Jdg 2:9}   And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash.
{Jdg 2:9}   以色列人将他葬在他地业的境内，就是在以法莲山地的亭拿希烈，在迦实山的北边。
{Jdg 2:10}  And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD or the work that he had done for Israel.
{Jdg 2:10}  那世代的人也都归了自己的列祖。后来有别的世代兴起，不知道耶和华，也不知道耶和华为以色列人所行的事。
{Jdg 2:11}  And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals.
{Jdg 2:11}  以色列人行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，去事奉诸巴力，
{Jdg 2:12}  And they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. And they provoked the LORD to anger.
{Jdg 2:12}  离弃了领他们出埃及地的耶和华他们列祖的神，去叩拜别神，就是四围列国的神，惹耶和华发怒；
{Jdg 2:13}  They abandoned the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth.
{Jdg 2:13}  并离弃耶和华，去事奉巴力和亚斯他录。
{Jdg 2:14}  So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them. And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies.
{Jdg 2:14}  耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作，就把他们交在抢夺他们的人手中，又将他们付与四围仇敌的手中，甚至他们在仇敌面前再不能站立得住。
{Jdg 2:15}  Whenever they marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them for harm, as the LORD had warned, and as the LORD had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress.
{Jdg 2:15}  他们无论往何处去，耶和华都以灾祸攻击他们，正如耶和华所说的话，又如耶和华向他们所起的誓；他们便极其困苦。
{Jdg 2:16}  Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them.
{Jdg 2:16}  耶和华兴起士师，士师就拯救他们脱离抢夺他们人的手。
{Jdg 2:17}  Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the LORD, and they did not do so.
{Jdg 2:17}  他们却不听从士师，竟随从叩拜别神，行了邪淫，速速地偏离他们列祖所行的道，不如他们列祖顺从耶和华的命令。
{Jdg 2:18}  Whenever the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them.
{Jdg 2:18}  耶和华为他们兴起士师，就与那士师同在。士师在世的一切日子，耶和华拯救他们脱离仇敌的手。他们因受欺压扰害，就哀声叹气，所以耶和华后悔了。
{Jdg 2:19}  But whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways.
{Jdg 2:19}  及至士师死后，他们就转去行恶，比他们列祖更甚，去事奉叩拜别神，总不断绝顽梗的恶行。
{Jdg 2:20}  So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he said, "Because this people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice,
{Jdg 2:20}  于是耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作。他说：“因这民违背我吩咐他们列祖所守的约，不听从我的话，
{Jdg 2:21}  I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died,
{Jdg 2:21}  所以约书亚死的时候所剩下的各族，我必不再从他们面前赶出，
{Jdg 2:22}  in order to test Israel by them, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the LORD as their fathers did, or not."
{Jdg 2:22}  为要藉此试验以色列人，看他们肯照他们列祖谨守遵行我的道不肯。”
{Jdg 2:23}  So the LORD left those nations, not driving them out quickly, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua.
{Jdg 2:23}  这样耶和华留下各族，不将他们速速赶出，也没有交付约书亚的手。
{Jdg 3:1}   Now these are the nations that the LORD left, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had not experienced all the wars in Canaan.
{Jdg 3:1}   耶和华留下这几族，为要试验那不曾知道与迦南争战之事的以色列人，
{Jdg 3:2}   It was only in order that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, to teach war to those who had not known it before.
{Jdg 3:2}   好叫以色列的后代又知道又学习未曾晓得的战事。
{Jdg 3:3}   These are the nations: the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.
{Jdg 3:3}   所留下的就是非利士的五个首领和一切迦南人、西顿人，并住利巴嫩山的希未人，从巴力黑们山直到哈马口。
{Jdg 3:4}   They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
{Jdg 3:4}   留下这几族，为要试验以色列人，知道他们肯听从耶和华藉摩西吩咐他们列祖的诫命不肯。
{Jdg 3:5}   So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
{Jdg 3:5}   以色列人竟住在迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人中间，
{Jdg 3:6}   And their daughters they took to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they served their gods.
{Jdg 3:6}   娶他们的女儿为妻，将自己的女儿嫁给他们的儿子，并事奉他们的神。
{Jdg 3:7}   And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth.
{Jdg 3:7}   以色列人行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，忘记耶和华他们的神，去事奉诸巴力和亚舍拉，
{Jdg 3:8}   Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia. And the people of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
{Jdg 3:8}   所以耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作，就把他们交在美索不达米亚王古珊利萨田的手中。以色列人服事古珊利萨田八年。
{Jdg 3:9}   But when the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
{Jdg 3:9}   以色列人呼求耶和华的时候，耶和华就为他们兴起一位拯救者救他们，就是迦勒兄弟基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂。
{Jdg 3:10}  The Spirit of the LORD was upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. And his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.
{Jdg 3:10}  耶和华的灵降在他身上，他就作了以色列的士师，出去争战。耶和华将美索不达米亚王古珊利萨田交在他手中，他便胜了古珊利萨田。
{Jdg 3:11}  So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
{Jdg 3:11}  于是国中太平四十年。基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂死了。
{Jdg 3:12}  And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
{Jdg 3:12}  以色列人又行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，耶和华就使摩押王伊矶伦强盛，攻击以色列人。
{Jdg 3:13}  He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel. And they took possession of the city of palms.
{Jdg 3:13}  伊矶伦招聚亚扪人和亚玛力人，去攻打以色列人，占据棕树城。
{Jdg 3:14}  And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
{Jdg 3:14}  于是以色列人服事摩押王伊矶伦十八年。
{Jdg 3:15}  Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, and the LORD raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.
{Jdg 3:15}  以色列人呼求耶和华的时候，耶和华就为他们兴起一位拯救者，就是便雅悯人基拉的儿子以笏；他是左手便利的。以色列人托他送礼物给摩押王伊矶伦。
{Jdg 3:16}  And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes.
{Jdg 3:16}  以笏打了一把两刃的剑，长一肘，带在右腿上衣服里面。
{Jdg 3:17}  And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
{Jdg 3:17}  他将礼物献给摩押王伊矶伦（原来伊矶伦极其肥胖）；
{Jdg 3:18}  And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.
{Jdg 3:18}  以笏献完礼物，便将抬礼物的人打发走了，
{Jdg 3:19}  But he himself turned back at the idols near Gilgal and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he commanded, "Silence." And all his attendants went out from his presence.
{Jdg 3:19}  自己却从靠近吉甲凿石之地回来，说：“王啊，我有一件机密事奏告你。”王说：“回避吧！”于是左右侍立的人都退去了。
{Jdg 3:20}  And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." And he arose from his seat.
{Jdg 3:20}  以笏来到王面前；王独自一人坐在凉楼上。以笏说：“我奉神的命报告你一件事。”王就从座位上站起来。
{Jdg 3:21}  And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.
{Jdg 3:21}  以笏便伸左手，从右腿上拔出剑来，刺入王的肚腹，
{Jdg 3:22}  And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and the dung came out.
{Jdg 3:22}  连剑把都刺进去了。剑被肥肉夹住，他没有从王的肚腹拔出来，且穿通了后身。
{Jdg 3:23}  Then Ehud went out into the porch and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locked them.
{Jdg 3:23}  以笏就出到游廊，将楼门尽都关锁。
{Jdg 3:24}  When he had gone, the servants came, and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, "Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber."
{Jdg 3:24}  以笏出来之后，王的仆人到了，看见楼门关锁，就说：“他必是在楼上大解。”
{Jdg 3:25}  And they waited till they were embarrassed. But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor.
{Jdg 3:25}  他们等烦了，见仍不开楼门，就拿钥匙开了，不料，他们的主人已死，倒在地上。
{Jdg 3:26}  Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah.
{Jdg 3:26}  他们耽延的时候，以笏就逃跑了，经过凿石之地，逃到西伊拉；
{Jdg 3:27}  When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader.
{Jdg 3:27}  到了，就在以法莲山地吹角。以色列人随着他下了山地，他在前头引路，
{Jdg 3:28}  And he said to them, "Follow after me, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand." So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over.
{Jdg 3:28}  对他们说：“你们随我来，因为耶和华已经把你们的仇敌摩押人交在你们手中。”于是他们跟着他下去，把守约但河的渡口，不容摩押一人过去。
{Jdg 3:29}  And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped.
{Jdg 3:29}  那时击杀了摩押人约有一万，都是强壮的勇士，没有一人逃脱。
{Jdg 3:30}  So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.
{Jdg 3:30}  这样，摩押就被以色列人制伏了。国中太平八十年。
{Jdg 3:31}  After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines with an oxgoad, and he also saved Israel.
{Jdg 3:31}  以笏之后，有亚拿的儿子珊迦，他用赶牛的棍子打死六百非利士人。他也救了以色列人。
{Jdg 4:1}   And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD after Ehud died.
{Jdg 4:1}   以笏死后，以色列人又行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，
{Jdg 4:2}   And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim.
{Jdg 4:2}   耶和华就把他们付与在夏琐作王的迦南王耶宾手中；他的将军是西西拉，住在外邦人的夏罗设。
{Jdg 4:3}   Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help, for he had 900 chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years.
{Jdg 4:3}   耶宾王有铁车九百辆。他大大欺压以色列人二十年，以色列人就呼求耶和华。
{Jdg 4:4}   Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
{Jdg 4:4}   有一位女先知名叫底波拉，是拉比多的妻，当时作以色列的士师。
{Jdg 4:5}   She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment.
{Jdg 4:5}   他住在以法莲山地拉玛和伯特利中间，在底波拉的棕树下。以色列人都上他那里去听判断。
{Jdg 4:6}   She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali and said to him, "Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you, 'Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun.
{Jdg 4:6}   他打发人从拿弗他利的基低斯将亚比挪庵的儿子巴拉召了来，对他说：“耶和华以色列的神吩咐你说：‘你率领一万拿弗他利和西布伦人上他泊山去。
{Jdg 4:7}   And I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand'?"
{Jdg 4:7}   我必使耶宾的将军西西拉率领他的车辆和全军往基顺河，到你那里去；我必将他交在你手中。’”
{Jdg 4:8}   Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go."
{Jdg 4:8}   巴拉说：“你若同我去，我就去；你若不同我去，我就不去。”
{Jdg 4:9}   And she said, "I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
{Jdg 4:9}   底波拉说：“我必与你同去，只是你在所行的路上得不着荣耀，因为耶和华要将西西拉交在一个妇人手里。”于是底波拉起来，与巴拉一同往基低斯去了。
{Jdg 4:10}  And Barak called out Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.
{Jdg 4:10}  巴拉就招聚西布伦人和拿弗他利人到基低斯，跟他上去的有一万人。底波拉也同他上去。
{Jdg 4:11}  Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.
{Jdg 4:11}  摩西岳父（或作：内兄）何巴的后裔，基尼人希百曾离开基尼族，到靠近基低斯撒拿音的橡树旁支搭帐棚。
{Jdg 4:12}  When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,
{Jdg 4:12}  有人告诉西西拉说：“亚比挪庵的儿子巴拉已经上他泊山了。”
{Jdg 4:13}  Sisera called out all his chariots, 900 chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon.
{Jdg 4:13}  西西拉就聚集所有的铁车九百辆和跟随他的全军，从外邦人的夏罗设出来，到了基顺河。
{Jdg 4:14}  And Deborah said to Barak, "Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Does not the LORD go out before you?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him.
{Jdg 4:14}  底波拉对巴拉说：“你起来，今日就是耶和华将西西拉交在你手的日子。耶和华岂不在你前头行吗？”于是巴拉下了他泊山，跟随他有一万人。
{Jdg 4:15}  And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot.
{Jdg 4:15}  耶和华使西西拉和他一切车辆全军溃乱，在巴拉面前被刀杀败；西西拉下车步行逃跑。
{Jdg 4:16}  And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.
{Jdg 4:16}  巴拉追赶车辆、军队，直到外邦人的夏罗设。西西拉的全军都倒在刀下，没有留下一人。
{Jdg 4:17}  But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
{Jdg 4:17}  只有西西拉步行逃跑，到了基尼人希百之妻雅亿的帐棚，因为夏琐王耶宾与基尼人希百家和好。
{Jdg 4:18}  And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me; do not be afraid." So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
{Jdg 4:18}  雅亿出来迎接西西拉，对他说：“请我主进来，不要惧怕”；西西拉就进了他的帐棚。雅忆用被将他遮盖。
{Jdg 4:19}  And he said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.
{Jdg 4:19}  西西拉对雅亿说：“我渴了，求你给我一点水喝。”雅亿就打开皮袋，给他奶子喝，仍旧把他遮盖。
{Jdg 4:20}  And he said to her, "Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say, 'No.'"
{Jdg 4:20}  西西拉又对雅亿说：“请你站在帐棚门口，若有人来问你说：‘有人在这里没有？’你就说：‘没有。’”
{Jdg 4:21}  But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died.
{Jdg 4:21}  西西拉疲乏沉睡。希百的妻雅亿取了帐棚的橛子，手里拿着锤子，轻悄悄地到他旁边，将橛子从他鬓边钉进去，钉入地里。西西拉就死了。
{Jdg 4:22}  And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.
{Jdg 4:22}  巴拉追赶西西拉的时候，雅亿出来迎接他说：“来吧，我将你所寻找的人给你看。”他就进入帐棚，看见西西拉已经死了，倒在地上，橛子还在他鬓中。
{Jdg 4:23}  So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel.
{Jdg 4:23}  这样，神使迦南王耶宾被以色列人制伏了。
{Jdg 4:24}  And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
{Jdg 4:24}  从此以色列人的手越发有力，胜了迦南王耶宾，直到将他灭绝了。
{Jdg 5:1}   Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day:
{Jdg 5:1}   那时，底波拉和亚比挪庵的儿子巴拉作歌，说：
{Jdg 5:2}   "That the leaders took the lead in Israel, that the people offered themselves willingly, bless the LORD!
{Jdg 5:2}   因为以色列中有军长率领，百姓也甘心牺牲自己，你们应当颂赞耶和华！
{Jdg 5:3}   "Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes; to the LORD I will sing; I will make melody to the LORD, the God of Israel.
{Jdg 5:3}   君王啊，要听！王子啊，要侧耳而听！我要向耶和华歌唱；我要歌颂耶和华以色列的神。
{Jdg 5:4}   "LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the region of Edom, the earth trembled and the heavens dropped, yes, the clouds dropped water.
{Jdg 5:4}   耶和华啊，你从西珥出来，由以东地行走。那时地震天漏，云也落雨。
{Jdg 5:5}   The mountains quaked before the LORD, even Sinai before the LORD, the God of Israel.
{Jdg 5:5}   山见耶和华的面就震动，西乃山见耶和华以色列神的面也是如此。
{Jdg 5:6}   "In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned, and travelers kept to the byways.
{Jdg 5:6}   在亚拿之子珊迦的时候，又在雅亿的日子，大道无人行走，都是绕道而行。
{Jdg 5:7}   The villagers ceased in Israel; they ceased to be until I arose; I, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel.
{Jdg 5:7}   以色列中的官长停职，直到我底波拉兴起，等我兴起作以色列的母。
{Jdg 5:8}   When new gods were chosen, then war was in the gates. Was shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel?
{Jdg 5:8}   以色列人选择新神，争战的事就临到城门。那时，以色列四万人中岂能见盾牌枪矛呢？
{Jdg 5:9}   My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless the LORD.
{Jdg 5:9}   我心倾向以色列的首领，他们在民中甘心牺牲自己。你们应当颂赞耶和华！
{Jdg 5:10}  "Tell of it, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets and you who walk by the way.
{Jdg 5:10}  骑白驴的、坐绣花毯子的、行路的，你们都当传扬！
{Jdg 5:11}  To the sound of musicians at the watering places, there they repeat the righteous triumphs of the LORD, the righteous triumphs of his villagers in Israel. "Then down to the gates marched the people of the LORD.
{Jdg 5:11}  在远离弓箭响声打水之处，人必述说耶和华公义的作为，就是他治理以色列公义的作为。那时耶和华的民下到城门。
{Jdg 5:12}  "Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, break out in a song! Arise, Barak, lead away your captives, O son of Abinoam.
{Jdg 5:12}  底波拉啊，兴起！兴起！你当兴起，兴起，唱歌。亚比挪庵的儿子巴拉啊，你当奋兴，掳掠你的敌人。
{Jdg 5:13}  Then down marched the remnant of the noble; the people of the LORD marched down for me against the mighty.
{Jdg 5:13}  那时有余剩的贵胄和百姓一同下来；耶和华降临，为我攻击勇士。
{Jdg 5:14}  From Ephraim their root they marched down into the valley, following you, Benjamin, with your kinsmen; from Machir marched down the commanders, and from Zebulun those who bear the lieutenant's staff;
{Jdg 5:14}  有根本在亚玛力人的地，从以法莲下来的；便雅悯在民中跟随你。有掌权的从玛吉下来；有持杖检点民数的从西布伦下来；
{Jdg 5:15}  the princes of Issachar came with Deborah, and Issachar faithful to Barak; into the valley they rushed at his heels. Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
{Jdg 5:15}  以萨迦的首领与底波拉同来；以萨迦怎样，巴拉也怎样。众人都跟随巴拉冲下平原；在流便的溪水旁有心中定大志的。
{Jdg 5:16}  Why did you sit still among the sheepfolds, to hear the whistling for the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
{Jdg 5:16}  你为何坐在羊圈内听群中吹笛的声音呢？在流便的溪水旁有心中设大谋的。
{Jdg 5:17}  Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan; and Dan, why did he stay with the ships? Asher sat still at the coast of the sea, staying by his landings.
{Jdg 5:17}  基列人安居在约但河外。但人为何等在船上？亚设人在海口静坐，在港口安居。
{Jdg 5:18}  Zebulun is a people who risked their lives to the death; Naphtali, too, on the heights of the field.
{Jdg 5:18}  西布伦人是拚命敢死的；拿弗他利人在田野的高处也是如此。
{Jdg 5:19}  "The kings came, they fought; then fought the kings of Canaan, at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; they got no spoils of silver.
{Jdg 5:19}  君王都来争战。那时迦南诸王在米吉多水旁的他纳争战，却未得掳掠银钱。
{Jdg 5:20}  From heaven the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera.
{Jdg 5:20}  星宿从天上争战，从其轨道攻击西西拉。
{Jdg 5:21}  The torrent Kishon swept them away, the ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. March on, my soul, with might!
{Jdg 5:21}  基顺古河把敌人冲没；我的灵啊，应当努力前行。
{Jdg 5:22}  "Then loud beat the horses' hoofs with the galloping, galloping of his steeds.
{Jdg 5:22}  那时壮马驰驱，踢跳，奔腾。
{Jdg 5:23}  "Curse Meroz, says the angel of the LORD, curse its inhabitants thoroughly, because they did not come to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
{Jdg 5:23}  耶和华的使者说：应当咒诅米罗斯，大大咒诅其中的居民；因为他们不来帮助耶和华，不来帮助耶和华攻击勇士。
{Jdg 5:24}  "Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, of tent-dwelling women most blessed.
{Jdg 5:24}  愿基尼人希百的妻雅亿比众妇人多得福气，比住帐棚的妇人更蒙福祉。
{Jdg 5:25}  He asked for water and she gave him milk; she brought him curds in a noble's bowl.
{Jdg 5:25}  西西拉求水，雅亿给他奶子，用宝贵的盘子给他奶油。
{Jdg 5:26}  She sent her hand to the tent peg and her right hand to the workmen's mallet; she struck Sisera; she crushed his head; she shattered and pierced his temple.
{Jdg 5:26}  雅亿左手拿着帐棚的橛子，右手拿着匠人的锤子，击打西西拉，打伤他的头，把他的鬓角打破穿通。
{Jdg 5:27}  Between her feet he sank, he fell, he lay still; between her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell--dead.
{Jdg 5:27}  西西拉在他脚前曲身仆倒，在他脚前曲身倒卧；在那里曲身，就在那里死亡。
{Jdg 5:28}  "Out of the window she peered, the mother of Sisera wailed through the lattice: 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the hoofbeats of his chariots?'
{Jdg 5:28}  西西拉的母亲从窗户里往外观看，从窗棂中呼叫说：他的战车为何耽延不来呢？他的车轮为何行得慢呢？
{Jdg 5:29}  Her wisest princesses answer, indeed, she answers herself,
{Jdg 5:29}  聪明的宫女安慰他（原文作回答他），他也自言自语地说：
{Jdg 5:30}  'Have they not found and divided the spoil?-- A womb or two for every man; spoil of dyed materials for Sisera, spoil of dyed materials embroidered, two pieces of dyed work embroidered for the neck as spoil?'
{Jdg 5:30}  他们莫非得财而分？每人得了一两个女子？西西拉得了彩衣为掳物，得绣花的彩衣为掠物。这彩衣两面绣花，乃是披在被掳之人颈项上的。
{Jdg 5:31}  "So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But your friends be like the sun as he rises in his might." And the land had rest for forty years.
{Jdg 5:31}  耶和华啊，愿你的仇敌都这样灭亡！愿爱你的人如日头出现，光辉烈烈！这样，国中太平四十年。
{Jdg 6:1}   The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of Midian seven years.
{Jdg 6:1}   以色列人又行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，耶和华就把他们交在米甸人手里七年。
{Jdg 6:2}   And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel, and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.
{Jdg 6:2}   米甸人压制以色列人；以色列人因为米甸人，就在山中挖穴、挖洞、建造营寨。
{Jdg 6:3}   For whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them.
{Jdg 6:3}   以色列人每逢撒种之后，米甸人、亚玛力人，和东方人都上来攻打他们，
{Jdg 6:4}   They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land, as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey.
{Jdg 6:4}   对着他们安营，毁坏土产，直到迦萨，没有给以色列人留下食物，牛、羊、驴也没有留下；
{Jdg 6:5}   For they would come up with their livestock and their tents; they would come like locusts in number--both they and their camels could not be counted--so that they laid waste the land as they came in.
{Jdg 6:5}   因为那些人带着牲畜帐棚来，像蝗虫那样多，人和骆驼无数，都进入国内，毁坏全地。
{Jdg 6:6}   And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. And the people of Israel cried out for help to the LORD.
{Jdg 6:6}   以色列人因米甸人的缘故，极其穷乏，就呼求耶和华。
{Jdg 6:7}   When the people of Israel cried out to the LORD on account of the Midianites,
{Jdg 6:7}   以色列人因米甸人的缘故，呼求耶和华，
{Jdg 6:8}   the LORD sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery.
{Jdg 6:8}   耶和华就差遣先知到以色列人那里，对他们说：“耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘我曾领你们从埃及上来，出了为奴之家，
{Jdg 6:9}   And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land.
{Jdg 6:9}   救你们脱离埃及人的手，并脱离一切欺压你们之人的手，把他们从你们面前赶出，将他们的地赐给你们’；
{Jdg 6:10}  And I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.' But you have not obeyed my voice."
{Jdg 6:10}  又对你们说：‘我是耶和华你们的神。你们住在亚摩利人的地，不可敬畏他们的神。你们竟不听从我的话。’”
{Jdg 6:11}  Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites.
{Jdg 6:11}  耶和华的使者到了俄弗拉，坐在亚比以谢族人约阿施的橡树下。约阿施的儿子基甸正在酒榨那里打麦子，为要防备米甸人。
{Jdg 6:12}  And the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, "The LORD is with you, O mighty man of valor."
{Jdg 6:12}  耶和华的使者向基甸显现，对他说：“大能的勇士啊，耶和华与你同在！”
{Jdg 6:13}  And Gideon said to him, "Please, my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian."
{Jdg 6:13}  基甸说：“主啊，耶和华若与我们同在，我们何至遭遇这一切事呢？我们的列祖不是向我们说‘耶和华领我们从埃及上来’吗？他那样奇妙的作为在那里呢？现在他却丢弃我们，将我们交在米甸人手里。”
{Jdg 6:14}  And the LORD turned to him and said, "Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?"
{Jdg 6:14}  耶和华观看基甸，说：“你靠着你这能力去从米甸人手里拯救以色列人，不是我差遣你去的吗？”
{Jdg 6:15}  And he said to him, "Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house."
{Jdg 6:15}  基甸说：“主啊，我有何能拯救以色列人呢？我家在玛拿西支派中是至贫穷的。我在我父家是至微小的。”
{Jdg 6:16}  And the LORD said to him, "But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man."
{Jdg 6:16}  耶和华对他说：“我与你同在，你就必击打米甸人，如击打一人一样。”
{Jdg 6:17}  And he said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me.
{Jdg 6:17}  基甸说：“我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你给我一个证据，使我知道与我说话的就是主。
{Jdg 6:18}  Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you." And he said, "I will stay till you return."
{Jdg 6:18}  求你不要离开这里，等我归回将礼物带来供在你面前。”主说：“我必等你回来。”
{Jdg 6:19}  So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them.
{Jdg 6:19}  基甸去预备了一只山羊羔，用一伊法细面做了无酵饼，将肉放在筐内，把汤盛在壶中，带到橡树下，献在使者面前。
{Jdg 6:20}  And the angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them." And he did so.
{Jdg 6:20}  神的使者吩咐基甸说：“将肉和无酵饼放在这磐石上，把汤倒出来。”他就这样行了。
{Jdg 6:21}  Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.
{Jdg 6:21}  耶和华的使者伸出手内的杖，杖头挨了肉和无酵饼，就有火从磐石中出来，烧尽了肉和无酵饼。耶和华的使者也就不见了。
{Jdg 6:22}  Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD. And Gideon said, "Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face."
{Jdg 6:22}  基甸见他是耶和华的使者，就说：“哀哉！主耶和华啊，我不好了，因为我觌面看见耶和华的使者。”
{Jdg 6:23}  But the LORD said to him, "Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die."
{Jdg 6:23}  耶和华对他说：“你放心，不要惧怕，你必不至死。”
{Jdg 6:24}  Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it, The LORD Is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.
{Jdg 6:24}  于是基甸在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛，起名叫“耶和华沙龙”（就是耶和华赐平安的意思）。（这坛在亚比以谢族的俄弗拉直到如今。）
{Jdg 6:25}  That night the LORD said to him, "Take your father's bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it
{Jdg 6:25}  当那夜，耶和华吩咐基甸说：“你取你父亲的牛来，就是（或作：和）那七岁的第二只牛，并拆毁你父亲为巴力所筑的坛，砍下坛旁的木偶，
{Jdg 6:26}  and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down."
{Jdg 6:26}  在这磐石（原文作保障）上整整齐齐地为耶和华你的神筑一座坛，将第二只牛献为燔祭，用你所砍下的木偶作柴。”
{Jdg 6:27}  So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night.
{Jdg 6:27}  基甸就从他仆人中挑了十个人，照着耶和华吩咐他的行了。他因怕父家和本城的人，不敢在白昼行这事，就在夜间行了。
{Jdg 6:28}  When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built.
{Jdg 6:28}  城里的人清早起来，见巴力的坛拆毁，坛旁的木偶砍下，第二只牛献在新筑的坛上，
{Jdg 6:29}  And they said to one another, "Who has done this thing?" And after they had searched and inquired, they said, "Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing."
{Jdg 6:29}  就彼此说：“这事是谁做的呢？”他们访查之后，就说：“这是约阿施的儿子基甸做的。”
{Jdg 6:30}  Then the men of the town said to Joash, "Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it."
{Jdg 6:30}  城里的人对约阿施说：“将你儿子交出来，好治死他；因为他拆毁了巴力的坛，砍下坛旁的木偶。”
{Jdg 6:31}  But Joash said to all who stood against him, "Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down."
{Jdg 6:31}  约阿施回答站着攻击他的众人说：“你们是为巴力争论吗？你们要救他吗？谁为他争论，趁早将谁治死！巴力若果是神，有人拆毁他的坛，让他为自己争论吧！”
{Jdg 6:32}  Therefore on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, "Let Baal contend against him," because he broke down his altar.
{Jdg 6:32}  所以当日人称基甸为耶路巴力，意思说：“他拆毁巴力的坛，让巴力与他争论。”
{Jdg 6:33}  Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.
{Jdg 6:33}  那时，米甸人、亚玛力人，和东方人都聚集过河，在耶斯列平原安营。
{Jdg 6:34}  But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him.
{Jdg 6:34}  耶和华的灵降在基甸身上，他就吹角；亚比以谢族都聚集跟随他。
{Jdg 6:35}  And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.
{Jdg 6:35}  他打发人走遍玛拿西地，玛拿西人也聚集跟随他；又打发人去见亚设人、西布伦人、拿弗他利人，他们也都出来与他们会合。
{Jdg 6:36}  Then Gideon said to God, "If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,
{Jdg 6:36}  基甸对神说：“你若果照着所说的话，藉我手拯救以色列人，
{Jdg 6:37}  behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said."
{Jdg 6:37}  我就把一团羊毛放在禾场上：若单是羊毛上有露水，别的地方都是干的，我就知道你必照着所说的话，藉我手拯救以色列人。”
{Jdg 6:38}  And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.
{Jdg 6:38}  次日早晨基甸起来，见果然是这样；将羊毛挤一挤，从羊毛中拧出满盆的露水来。
{Jdg 6:39}  Then Gideon said to God, "Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece. Please let it be dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground let there be dew."
{Jdg 6:39}  基甸又对神说：“求你不要向我发怒，我再说这一次：让我将羊毛再试一次。但愿羊毛是干的，别的地方都有露水。”
{Jdg 6:40}  And God did so that night; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.
{Jdg 6:40}  这夜神也如此行：独羊毛上是干的，别的地方都有露水。
{Jdg 7:1}   Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
{Jdg 7:1}   耶路巴力就是基甸，他和一切跟随的人早晨起来，在哈律泉旁安营。米甸营在他们北边的平原，靠近摩利冈。
{Jdg 7:2}   The LORD said to Gideon, "The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel boast over me, saying, 'My own hand has saved me.'
{Jdg 7:2}   耶和华对基甸说：“跟随你的人过多，我不能将米甸人交在他们手中，免得以色列人向我夸大，说：‘是我们自己的手救了我们。’
{Jdg 7:3}   Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home and hurry away from Mount Gilead.'" Then 22,000 of the people returned, and 10,000 remained.
{Jdg 7:3}   现在你要向这些人宣告说：‘凡惧怕胆怯的，可以离开基列山回去。’”于是有二万二千人回去，只剩下一万。
{Jdg 7:4}   And the LORD said to Gideon, "The people are still too many. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there, and anyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall go with you,' shall go with you, and anyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall not go with you,' shall not go."
{Jdg 7:4}   耶和华对基甸说：“人还是过多；你要带他们下到水旁，我好在那里为你试试他们。我指点谁说：‘这人可以同你去’，他就可以同你去；我指点谁说：‘这人不可同你去’，他就不可同你去。”
{Jdg 7:5}   So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, "Every one who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself. Likewise, every one who kneels down to drink."
{Jdg 7:5}   基甸就带他们下到水旁。耶和华对基甸说：“凡用舌头舔水，像狗舔的，要使他单站在一处；凡跪下喝水的，也要使他单站在一处。”
{Jdg 7:6}   And the number of those who lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.
{Jdg 7:6}   于是用手捧着舔水的有三百人，其余的都跪下喝水。
{Jdg 7:7}   And the LORD said to Gideon, "With the 300 men who lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hand, and let all the others go every man to his home."
{Jdg 7:7}   耶和华对基甸说：“我要用这舔水的三百人拯救你们，将米甸人交在你手中；其余的人都可以各归各处去。”
{Jdg 7:8}   So the people took provisions in their hands, and their trumpets. And he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the 300 men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
{Jdg 7:8}   这三百人就带着食物和角；其余的以色列人，基甸都打发他们各归各的帐棚，只留下这三百人。米甸营在他下边的平原里。
{Jdg 7:9}   That same night the LORD said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand.
{Jdg 7:9}   当那夜，耶和华吩咐基甸说：“起来，下到米甸营里去，因我已将他们交在你手中。
{Jdg 7:10}  But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant.
{Jdg 7:10}  倘若你怕下去，就带你的仆人普拉下到那营里去。
{Jdg 7:11}  And you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp." Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men who were in the camp.
{Jdg 7:11}  你必听见他们所说的，然后你就有胆量下去攻营。”于是基甸带着仆人普拉下到营旁。
{Jdg 7:12}  And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts in abundance, and their camels were without number, as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance.
{Jdg 7:12}  米甸人、亚玛力人，和一切东方人都布散在平原，如同蝗虫那样多。他们的骆驼无数，多如海边的沙。
{Jdg 7:13}  When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade. And he said, "Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat."
{Jdg 7:13}  基甸到了，就听见一人将梦告诉同伴说：“我做了一梦，梦见一个大麦饼滚入米甸营中，到了帐幕，将帐幕撞倒，帐幕就翻转倾覆了。”
{Jdg 7:14}  And his comrade answered, "This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given into his hand Midian and all the camp."
{Jdg 7:14}  那同伴说：“这不是别的，乃是以色列人约阿施的儿子基甸的刀；神已将米甸和全军都交在他的手中。”
{Jdg 7:15}  As soon as Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, "Arise, for the LORD has given the host of Midian into your hand."
{Jdg 7:15}  基甸听见这梦和梦的讲解，就敬拜神，回到以色列营中，说：“起来吧！耶和华已将米甸的军队交在你们手中了。”
{Jdg 7:16}  And he divided the 300 men into three companies and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars.
{Jdg 7:16}  于是基甸将三百人分作三队，把角和空瓶交在各人手里（瓶内都藏着火把），
{Jdg 7:17}  And he said to them, "Look at me, and do likewise. When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.
{Jdg 7:17}  吩咐他们说：“你们要看我行事：我到了营的旁边怎样行，你们也要怎样行。
{Jdg 7:18}  When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'"
{Jdg 7:18}  我和一切跟随我的人吹角的时候，你们也要在营的四围吹角，喊叫说：‘耶和华和基甸的刀！’”
{Jdg 7:19}  So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch. And they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands.
{Jdg 7:19}  基甸和跟随他的一百人，在三更之初才换更的时候，来到营旁，就吹角，打破手中的瓶。
{Jdg 7:20}  Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow. And they cried out, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"
{Jdg 7:20}  三队的人就都吹角，打破瓶子，左手拿着火把，右手拿着角，喊叫说：“耶和华和基甸的刀！”
{Jdg 7:21}  Every man stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran. They cried out and fled.
{Jdg 7:21}  他们在营的四围各站各的地方；全营的人都乱窜。三百人呐喊，使他们逃跑。
{Jdg 7:22}  When they blew the 300 trumpets, the LORD set every man's sword against his comrade and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
{Jdg 7:22}  三百人就吹角，耶和华使全营的人用刀互相击杀，逃到西利拉的伯哈示他，直逃到靠近他巴的亚伯米何拉。
{Jdg 7:23}  And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.
{Jdg 7:23}  以色列人就从拿弗他利、亚设，和玛拿西全地聚集来追赶米甸人。
{Jdg 7:24}  Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and capture the waters against them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan." So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.
{Jdg 7:24}  基甸打发人走遍以法莲山地，说：“你们下来攻击米甸人，争先把守约但河的渡口，直到伯巴拉。”于是以法莲的众人聚集，把守约但河的渡口，直到伯巴拉，
{Jdg 7:25}  And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. Then they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan.
{Jdg 7:25}  捉住了米甸人的两个首领：一名俄立，一名西伊伯；将俄立杀在俄立磐石上，将西伊伯杀在西伊伯酒榨那里；又追赶米甸人，将俄立和西伊伯的首级带过约但河，到基甸那里。
{Jdg 8:1}   Then the men of Ephraim said to him, "What is this that you have done to us, not to call us when you went to fight against Midian?" And they accused him fiercely.
{Jdg 8:1}   以法莲人对基甸说：“你去与米甸人争战，没有招我们同去，为什么这样待我们呢？”他们就与基甸大大的争吵。
{Jdg 8:2}   And he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?
{Jdg 8:2}   基甸对他们说：“我所行的岂能比你们所行的呢？以法莲拾取剩下的葡萄不强过亚比以谢所摘的葡萄吗？
{Jdg 8:3}   God has given into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger against him subsided when he said this.
{Jdg 8:3}   神已将米甸人的两个首领俄立和西伊伯交在你们手中；我所行的岂能比你们所行的呢？”基甸说了这话，以法莲人的怒气就消了。
{Jdg 8:4}   And Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over, he and the 300 men who were with him, exhausted yet pursuing.
{Jdg 8:4}   基甸和跟随他的三百人到约但河过渡，虽然疲乏，还是追赶。
{Jdg 8:5}   So he said to the men of Succoth, "Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
{Jdg 8:5}   基甸对疏割人说：“求你们拿饼来给跟随我的人吃，因为他们疲乏了；我们追赶米甸人的两个王西巴和撒慕拿。”
{Jdg 8:6}   And the officials of Succoth said, "Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?"
{Jdg 8:6}   疏割人的首领回答说：“西巴和撒慕拿已经在你手里，你使我们将饼给你的军兵吗？”
{Jdg 8:7}   So Gideon said, "Well then, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
{Jdg 8:7}   基甸说：“耶和华将西巴和撒慕拿交在我手之后，我就用野地的荆条和枳棘打伤你们。”
{Jdg 8:8}   And from there he went up to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
{Jdg 8:8}   基甸从那里上到毗努伊勒，对那里的人也是这样说；毗努伊勒人也与疏割人回答他的话一样。
{Jdg 8:9}   And he said to the men of Penuel, "When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."
{Jdg 8:9}   他向毗努伊勒人说：“我平平安安回来的时候，我必拆毁这楼。”
{Jdg 8:10}  Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East, for there had fallen 120,000 men who drew the sword.
{Jdg 8:10}  那时西巴和撒慕拿，并跟随他们的军队都在加各，约有一万五千人，就是东方人全军所剩下的；已经被杀约有十二万拿刀的。
{Jdg 8:11}  And Gideon went up by the way of the tent dwellers east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the army, for the army felt secure.
{Jdg 8:11}  基甸就由挪巴和约比哈东边，从住帐棚人的路上去，杀败了米甸人的军兵，因为他们坦然无惧。
{Jdg 8:12}  And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he threw all the army into a panic.
{Jdg 8:12}  西巴和撒慕拿逃跑；基甸追赶他们，捉住米甸的二王西巴和撒慕拿，惊散全军。
{Jdg 8:13}  Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.
{Jdg 8:13}  约阿施的儿子基甸由希列斯坡从阵上回来，
{Jdg 8:14}  And he captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him. And he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men.
{Jdg 8:14}  捉住疏割的一个少年人，问他：“疏割的首领长老是谁？”他就将首领长老七十七个人的名字写出来。
{Jdg 8:15}  And he came to the men of Succoth and said, "Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted?'"
{Jdg 8:15}  基甸到了疏割，对那里的人说：“你们从前讥诮我说：‘西巴和撒慕拿已经在你手里，你使我们将饼给跟随你的疲乏人吗？’现在西巴和撒慕拿在这里。”
{Jdg 8:16}  And he took the elders of the city, and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth a lesson.
{Jdg 8:16}  于是捉住那城内的长老，用野地的荆条和枳棘责打（原文作指教）疏割人；
{Jdg 8:17}  And he broke down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
{Jdg 8:17}  又拆了毗努伊勒的楼，杀了那城里的人。
{Jdg 8:18}  Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "Where are the men whom you killed at Tabor?" They answered, "As you are, so were they. Every one of them resembled the son of a king."
{Jdg 8:18}  基甸问西巴和撒慕拿说：“你们在他泊山所杀的人是什么样式？”回答说：“他们好像你，各人都有王子的样式。”
{Jdg 8:19}  And he said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you."
{Jdg 8:19}  基甸说：“他们是我同母的弟兄，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你们从前若存留他们的性命，我如今就不杀你们了。”
{Jdg 8:20}  So he said to Jether his firstborn, "Rise and kill them!" But the young man did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a young man.
{Jdg 8:20}  于是对他的长子益帖说：“你起来杀他们。”但益帖因为是童子，害怕，不敢拔刀。
{Jdg 8:21}  Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise yourself and fall upon us, for as the man is, so is his strength." And Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
{Jdg 8:21}  西巴和撒慕拿说：“你自己起来杀我们吧！因为人如何，力量也是如何。”基甸就起来，杀了西巴和撒慕拿，夺获他们骆驼项上戴的月牙圈。
{Jdg 8:22}  Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also, for you have saved us from the hand of Midian."
{Jdg 8:22}  以色列人对基甸说：“你既救我们脱离米甸人的手，愿你和你的儿孙管理我们。”
{Jdg 8:23}  Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD will rule over you."
{Jdg 8:23}  基甸说：“我不管理你们，我的儿子也不管理你们，惟有耶和华管理你们。”
{Jdg 8:24}  And Gideon said to them, "Let me make a request of you: every one of you give me the earrings from his spoil." (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
{Jdg 8:24}  基甸又对他们说：“我有一件事求你们：请你们各人将所夺的耳环给我。”（原来仇敌是以实玛利人，都是戴金耳环的。）
{Jdg 8:25}  And they answered, "We will willingly give them." And they spread a cloak, and every man threw in it the earrings of his spoil.
{Jdg 8:25}  他们说：“我们情愿给你。”就铺开一件外衣，各人将所夺的耳环丢在其上。
{Jdg 8:26}  And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars that were around the necks of their camels.
{Jdg 8:26}  基甸所要出来的金耳环重一千七百舍客勒金子。此外还有米甸王所戴的月环、耳坠，和所穿的紫色衣服，并骆驼项上的金链子。
{Jdg 8:27}  And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel whored after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family.
{Jdg 8:27}  基甸以此制造了一个以弗得，设立在本城俄弗拉。后来以色列人拜那以弗得行了邪淫；这就作了基甸和他全家的网罗。
{Jdg 8:28}  So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they raised their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
{Jdg 8:28}  这样，米甸人被以色列人制伏了，不敢再抬头。基甸还在的日子，国中太平四十年。
{Jdg 8:29}  Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
{Jdg 8:29}  约阿施的儿子耶路巴力回去，住在自己家里。
{Jdg 8:30}  Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives.
{Jdg 8:30}  基甸有七十个亲生的儿子，因为他有许多的妻。
{Jdg 8:31}  And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.
{Jdg 8:31}  他的妾住在示剑，也给他生了一个儿子。基甸与他起名叫亚比米勒。
{Jdg 8:32}  And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
{Jdg 8:32}  约阿施的儿子基甸，年纪老迈而死，葬在亚比以谢族的俄弗拉，在他父亲约阿施的坟墓里。
{Jdg 8:33}  As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel turned again and whored after the Baals and made Baal-berith their god.
{Jdg 8:33}  基甸死后，以色列人又去随从诸巴力行邪淫，以巴力比利土为他们的神。
{Jdg 8:34}  And the people of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies on every side,
{Jdg 8:34}  以色列人不记念耶和华他们的} 神，就是拯救他们脱离四围仇敌之手的，
{Jdg 8:35}  and they did not show steadfast love to the family of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in return for all the good that he had done to Israel.
{Jdg 8:35}  也不照着耶路巴力，就是基甸向他们所施的恩惠厚待他的家。
{Jdg 9:1}   Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's relatives and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother's family,
{Jdg 9:1}   耶路巴力的儿子亚比米勒到了示剑见他的众母舅，对他们和他外祖全家的人说：
{Jdg 9:2}   "Say in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem, 'Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one rule over you?' Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh."
{Jdg 9:2}   “请你们问示剑的众人说，是耶路巴力的众子七十人都管理你们好呢？还是一人管理你们好呢？你们又要记念我是你们的骨肉。”
{Jdg 9:3}   And his mother's relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem, and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our brother."
{Jdg 9:3}   他的众母舅便将这一切话为他说给示剑人听，示剑人的心就归向亚比米勒。他们说：“他原是我们的弟兄”；
{Jdg 9:4}   And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him.
{Jdg 9:4}   就从巴力比利土的庙中取了七十舍客勒银子给亚比米勒；亚比米勒用以雇了些匪徒跟随他。
{Jdg 9:5}   And he went to his father's house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself.
{Jdg 9:5}   他往俄弗拉到他父亲的家，将他弟兄、耶路巴力的众子七十人都杀在一块磐石上；只剩下耶路巴力的小儿子约坦，因为他躲藏了。
{Jdg 9:6}   And all the leaders of Shechem came together, and all Beth-millo, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.
{Jdg 9:6}   示剑人和米罗人都一同聚集，往示剑橡树旁的柱子那里，立亚比米勒为王。
{Jdg 9:7}   When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and cried aloud and said to them, "Listen to me, you leaders of Shechem, that God may listen to you.
{Jdg 9:7}   有人将这事告诉约坦，他就去站在基利心山顶上，向众人大声喊叫说：“示剑人哪，你们要听我的话，神也就听你们的话。
{Jdg 9:8}   The trees once went out to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.'
{Jdg 9:8}   有一时树木要膏一树为王，管理他们，就去对橄榄树说：‘请你作我们的王。’
{Jdg 9:9}   But the olive tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my abundance, by which gods and men are honored, and go hold sway over the trees?'
{Jdg 9:9}   橄榄树回答说：‘我岂肯止住供奉神和尊重人的油，飘摇在众树之上呢？’
{Jdg 9:10}  And the trees said to the fig tree, 'You come and reign over us.'
{Jdg 9:10}  树木对无花果树说：‘请你来作我们的王。’
{Jdg 9:11}  But the fig tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit and go hold sway over the trees?'
{Jdg 9:11}  无花果树回答说：‘我岂肯止住所结甜美的果子，飘摇在众树之上呢？’
{Jdg 9:12}  And the trees said to the vine, 'You come and reign over us.'
{Jdg 9:12}  树木对葡萄树说：‘请你来作我们的王。’
{Jdg 9:13}  But the vine said to them, 'Shall I leave my wine that cheers God and men and go hold sway over the trees?'
{Jdg 9:13}  葡萄树回答说：‘我岂肯止住使神和人喜乐的新酒，飘摇在众树之上呢。’
{Jdg 9:14}  Then all the trees said to the bramble, 'You come and reign over us.'
{Jdg 9:14}  众树对荆棘说：‘请你来作我们的王。’
{Jdg 9:15}  And the bramble said to the trees, 'If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade, but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.'
{Jdg 9:15}  荆棘回答说：‘你们若诚诚实实地膏我为王，就要投在我的荫下；不然，愿火从荆棘里出来，烧灭利巴嫩的香柏树。’
{Jdg 9:16}  "Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and integrity when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him as his deeds deserved--
{Jdg 9:16}  “现在你们立亚比米勒为王，若按诚实正直善待耶路巴力和他的全家，这就是酬他的劳。
{Jdg 9:17}  for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian,
{Jdg 9:17}  从前我父冒死为你们争战，救了你们脱离米甸人的手。
{Jdg 9:18}  and you have risen up against my father's house this day and have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the leaders of Shechem, because he is your relative--
{Jdg 9:18}  你们如今起来攻击我的父家，将他众子七十人杀在一块磐石上，又立他婢女所生的儿子亚比米勒为示剑人的王；他原是你们的弟兄。
{Jdg 9:19}  if you then have acted in good faith and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
{Jdg 9:19}  你们如今若按诚实正直待耶路巴力和他的家，就可因亚比米勒得欢乐，他也可因你们得欢乐；
{Jdg 9:20}  But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and from Beth-millo and devour Abimelech."
{Jdg 9:20}  不然，愿火从亚比米勒发出，烧灭示剑人和米罗众人，又愿火从示剑人和米罗人中出来，烧灭亚比米勒。”
{Jdg 9:21}  And Jotham ran away and fled and went to Beer and lived there, because of Abimelech his brother.
{Jdg 9:21}  约坦因怕他弟兄亚比米勒，就逃跑，来到比珥，住在那里。
{Jdg 9:22}  Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.
{Jdg 9:22}  亚比米勒管理以色列人三年。
{Jdg 9:23}  And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
{Jdg 9:23}  神使恶魔降在亚比米勒和示剑人中间，示剑人就以诡诈待亚比米勒。
{Jdg 9:24}  that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
{Jdg 9:24}  这是要叫耶路巴力七十个儿子所受的残害归与他们的哥哥亚比米勒，又叫那流他们血的罪归与帮助他杀弟兄的示剑人。
{Jdg 9:25}  And the leaders of Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way. And it was told to Abimelech.
{Jdg 9:25}  示剑人在山顶上设埋伏，等候亚比米勒。凡从他们那里经过的人，他们就抢夺。有人将这事告诉亚比米勒。
{Jdg 9:26}  And Gaal the son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his relatives, and the leaders of Shechem put confidence in him.
{Jdg 9:26}  以别的儿子迦勒和他的弟兄来到示剑，示剑人都信靠他。
{Jdg 9:27}  And they went out into the field and gathered the grapes from their vineyards and trod them and held a festival; and they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and reviled Abimelech.
{Jdg 9:27}  示剑人出城到田间去，摘下葡萄，踹酒，设摆筵宴，进他们神的庙中吃喝，咒诅亚比米勒。
{Jdg 9:28}  And Gaal the son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who are we of Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him?
{Jdg 9:28}  以别的儿子迦勒说：“亚比米勒是谁？示剑是谁？使我们服事他呢？他不是耶路巴力的儿子吗？他的帮手不是西布勒吗？你们可以服事示剑的父亲哈抹的后裔。我们为何服事亚比米勒呢？
{Jdg 9:29}  Would that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech. I would say to Abimelech, 'Increase your army, and come out.'"
{Jdg 9:29}  惟愿这民归我的手下，我就除掉亚比米勒。”迦勒又对亚比米勒说：“增添你的军兵出来吧。”
{Jdg 9:30}  When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
{Jdg 9:30}  邑宰西布勒听见以别的儿子迦勒的话，就发怒，
{Jdg 9:31}  And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, "Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you.
{Jdg 9:31}  悄悄地打发人去见亚比米勒，说：“以别的儿子迦勒和他的弟兄到了示剑，煽惑城中的民攻击你。
{Jdg 9:32}  Now therefore, go by night, you and the people who are with you, and set an ambush in the field.
{Jdg 9:32}  现在你和跟随你的人今夜起来，在田间埋伏。
{Jdg 9:33}  Then in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and rush upon the city. And when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may do to them as your hand finds to do."
{Jdg 9:33}  到早晨太阳一出，你就起来闯城。迦勒和跟随他的人出来攻击你的时候，你便向他们见机而做。”
{Jdg 9:34}  So Abimelech and all the men who were with him rose up by night and set an ambush against Shechem in four companies.
{Jdg 9:34}  于是，亚比米勒和跟随他的众人夜间起来，分作四队，埋伏等候示剑人。
{Jdg 9:35}  And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, and Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from the ambush.
{Jdg 9:35}  以别的儿子迦勒出去，站在城门口。亚比米勒和跟随他的人从埋伏之处起来。
{Jdg 9:36}  And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops!" And Zebul said to him, "You mistake the shadow of the mountains for men."
{Jdg 9:36}  迦勒看见那些人，就对西布勒说：“看哪，有人从山顶上下来了。”西布勒说：“你看见山的影子，以为是人。”
{Jdg 9:37}  Gaal spoke again and said, "Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners' Oak."
{Jdg 9:37}  迦勒又说：“看哪，有人从高处下来，又有一队从米恶尼尼橡树的路上而来。”
{Jdg 9:38}  Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your mouth now, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?' Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them."
{Jdg 9:38}  西布勒对他说：“你曾说，亚比米勒是谁，叫我们服事他？你所夸的口在那里呢？这不是你所藐视的民吗？你现在出去，与他们交战吧！”
{Jdg 9:39}  And Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.
{Jdg 9:39}  于是迦勒率领示剑人出去，与亚比米勒交战。
{Jdg 9:40}  And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him. And many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate.
{Jdg 9:40}  亚比米勒追赶迦勒；迦勒在他面前逃跑，有许多受伤仆倒的，直到城门。
{Jdg 9:41}  And Abimelech lived at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives, so that they could not dwell at Shechem.
{Jdg 9:41}  亚比米勒住在亚鲁玛。西布勒赶出迦勒和他弟兄，不准他们住在示剑。
{Jdg 9:42}  On the following day, the people went out into the field, and Abimelech was told.
{Jdg 9:42}  次日，民出到田间，有人告诉亚比米勒；
{Jdg 9:43}  He took his people and divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. And he looked and saw the people coming out of the city. So he rose against them and killed them.
{Jdg 9:43}  他就把他的人分作三队，埋伏在田间，看见示剑人从城里出来，就起来击杀他们。
{Jdg 9:44}  Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies rushed upon all who were in the field and killed them.
{Jdg 9:44}  亚比米勒和跟随他的一队向前闯去，站在城门口；那两队直闯到田间，击杀了众人。
{Jdg 9:45}  And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed the people who were in it, and he razed the city and sowed it with salt.
{Jdg 9:45}  亚比米勒整天攻打城，将城夺取，杀了其中的居民，将城拆毁，撒上了盐。
{Jdg 9:46}  When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the house of El-berith.
{Jdg 9:46}  示剑楼的人听见了，就躲入巴力比利土庙的卫所。
{Jdg 9:47}  Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together.
{Jdg 9:47}  有人告诉亚比米勒说：“示剑楼的人都聚在一处。”
{Jdg 9:48}  And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bundle of brushwood and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the men who were with him, "What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done."
{Jdg 9:48}  亚比米勒和跟随他的人就都上撒们山。亚比米勒手拿斧子，砍下一根树枝，扛在肩上，对跟随他的人说：“你们看我所行的，也当赶紧照样行。”
{Jdg 9:49}  So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following Abimelech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about 1,000 men and women.
{Jdg 9:49}  众人就各砍一枝，跟随亚比米勒，把树枝堆在卫所的四围，放火烧了卫所，以致示剑楼的人都死了，男女约有一千。
{Jdg 9:50}  Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez and captured it.
{Jdg 9:50}  亚比米勒到提备斯，向提备斯安营，就攻取了那城。
{Jdg 9:51}  But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women and all the leaders of the city fled to it and shut themselves in, and they went up to the roof of the tower.
{Jdg 9:51}  城中有一座坚固的楼；城里的众人，无论男女，都逃进楼去，关上门，上了楼顶。
{Jdg 9:52}  And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
{Jdg 9:52}  亚比米勒到了楼前攻打，挨近楼门，要用火焚烧。
{Jdg 9:53}  And a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech's head and crushed his skull.
{Jdg 9:53}  有一个妇人把一块上磨石抛在亚比米勒的头上，打破了他的脑骨。
{Jdg 9:54}  Then he called quickly to the young man his armor-bearer and said to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, 'A woman killed him.'" And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
{Jdg 9:54}  他就急忙喊叫拿他兵器的少年人，对他说：“拔出你的刀来，杀了我吧！免得人议论我说，他为一个妇人所杀。”于是少年人把他刺透，他就死了。
{Jdg 9:55}  And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, everyone departed to his home.
{Jdg 9:55}  以色列人见亚比米勒死了，便各回自己的地方去了。
{Jdg 9:56}  Thus God returned the evil of Abimelech, which he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers.
{Jdg 9:56}  这样，神报应亚比米勒向他父亲所行的恶，就是杀了弟兄七十个人的恶。
{Jdg 9:57}  And God also made all the evil of the men of Shechem return on their heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
{Jdg 9:57}  示剑人的一切恶，神也都报应在他们头上；耶路巴力的儿子约坦的咒诅归到他们身上了。
{Jdg 10:1}  After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
{Jdg 10:1}  亚比米勒以后，有以萨迦人朵多的孙子、普瓦的儿子陀拉兴起，拯救以色列人。他住在以法莲山地的沙密。
{Jdg 10:2}  And he judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried at Shamir.
{Jdg 10:2}  陀拉作以色列的士师二十三年，就死了，葬在沙密。
{Jdg 10:3}  After him arose Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years.
{Jdg 10:3}  在他以后有基列人睚珥兴起，作以色列的士师二十二年。
{Jdg 10:4}  And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities, called Havvoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
{Jdg 10:4}  他有三十个儿子，骑着三十匹驴驹。他们有三十座城邑，叫作哈倭特睚珥，直到如今，都是在基列地。
{Jdg 10:5}  And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
{Jdg 10:5}  睚珥死了，就葬在加们。
{Jdg 10:6}  The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. And they forsook the LORD and did not serve him.
{Jdg 10:6}  以色列人又行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，去事奉诸巴力和亚斯他录，并亚兰的神、西顿的神、摩押的神、亚扪人的神、非利士人的神，离弃耶和华，不事奉他。
{Jdg 10:7}  So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites,
{Jdg 10:7}  耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作，就把他们交在非利士人和亚扪人的手中。
{Jdg 10:8}  and they crushed and oppressed the people of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
{Jdg 10:8}  从那年起，他们扰害欺压约但河那边、住亚摩利人之基列地的以色列人，共有十八年。
{Jdg 10:9}  And the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed.
{Jdg 10:9}  亚扪人又渡过约但河去攻打犹大和便雅悯，并以法莲族。以色列人就甚觉窘迫。
{Jdg 10:10} And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, "We have sinned against you, because we have forsaken our God and have served the Baals."
{Jdg 10:10} 以色列人哀求耶和华说：“我们得罪了你；因为离弃了我们神，去事奉诸巴力。”
{Jdg 10:11} And the LORD said to the people of Israel, "Did I not save you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites, from the Ammonites and from the Philistines?
{Jdg 10:11} 耶和华对以色列人说：“我岂没有救过你们脱离埃及人、亚摩利人、亚扪人，和非利士人吗？
{Jdg 10:12} The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, and you cried out to me, and I saved you out of their hand.
{Jdg 10:12} 西顿人、亚玛力人、马云人也都欺压你们；你们哀求我，我也拯救你们脱离他们的手。
{Jdg 10:13} Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods; therefore I will save you no more.
{Jdg 10:13} 你们竟离弃我，事奉别神！所以我不再救你们了。
{Jdg 10:14} Go and cry out to the gods whom you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress."
{Jdg 10:14} 你们去哀求所选择的神；你们遭遇急难的时候，让他救你们吧！”
{Jdg 10:15} And the people of Israel said to the LORD, "We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you. Only please deliver us this day."
{Jdg 10:15} 以色列人对耶和华说：“我们犯罪了，任凭你随意待我们吧！只求你今日拯救我们。”
{Jdg 10:16} So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD, and he became impatient over the misery of Israel.
{Jdg 10:16} 以色列人就除掉他们中间的外邦神，事奉耶和华。耶和华因以色列人受的苦难，就心中担忧。
{Jdg 10:17} Then the Ammonites were called to arms, and they encamped in Gilead. And the people of Israel came together, and they encamped at Mizpah.
{Jdg 10:17} 当时亚扪人聚集，安营在基列。以色列人也聚集，安营在米斯巴。
{Jdg 10:18} And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said one to another, "Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
{Jdg 10:18} 基列的民和众首领彼此商议说：“谁能先去攻打亚扪人，谁必作基列一切居民的领袖。”
{Jdg 11:1}  Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior, but he was the son of a prostitute. Gilead was the father of Jephthah.
{Jdg 11:1}  基列人耶弗他是个大能的勇士，是妓女的儿子。耶弗他是基列所生的。
{Jdg 11:2}  And Gilead's wife also bore him sons. And when his wife's sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, "You shall not have an inheritance in our father's house, for you are the son of another woman."
{Jdg 11:2}  基列的妻也生了几个儿子：他妻所生的儿子长大了，就赶逐耶弗他，说：“你不可在我们父家承受产业，因为你是妓女的儿子。”
{Jdg 11:3}  Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob, and worthless fellows collected around Jephthah and went out with him.
{Jdg 11:3}  耶弗他就逃避他的弟兄，去住在陀伯地，有些匪徒到他那里聚集，与他一同出入。
{Jdg 11:4}  After a time the Ammonites made war against Israel.
{Jdg 11:4}  过了些日子，亚扪人攻打以色列。
{Jdg 11:5}  And when the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob.
{Jdg 11:5}  亚扪人攻打以色列的时候，基列的长老到陀伯地去，要叫耶弗他回来；
{Jdg 11:6}  And they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our leader, that we may fight against the Ammonites."
{Jdg 11:6}  对耶弗他说：“请你来作我们的元帅，我们好与亚扪人争战。”
{Jdg 11:7}  But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me and drive me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?"
{Jdg 11:7}  耶弗他回答基列的长老说：“从前你们不是恨我、赶逐我出离父家吗？现在你们遭遇急难为何到我这里来呢？”
{Jdg 11:8}  And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "That is why we have turned to you now, that you may go with us and fight against the Ammonites and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
{Jdg 11:8}  基列的长老回答耶弗他说：“现在我们到你这里来，是要你同我们去，与亚扪人争战；你可以作基列一切居民的领袖。”
{Jdg 11:9}  Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me home again to fight against the Ammonites, and the LORD gives them over to me, I will be your head."
{Jdg 11:9}  耶弗他对基列的长老说：“你们叫我回去，与亚扪人争战，耶和华把他交给我，我可以作你们的领袖吗？”
{Jdg 11:10} And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The LORD will be witness between us, if we do not do as you say."
{Jdg 11:10} 基列的长老回答耶弗他说：“有耶和华在你我中间作见证，我们必定照你的话行。”
{Jdg 11:11} So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and leader over them. And Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD at Mizpah.
{Jdg 11:11} 于是耶弗他同基列的长老回去，百姓就立耶弗他作领袖、作元帅。耶弗他在米斯巴将自己的一切话陈明在耶和华面前。
{Jdg 11:12} Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites and said, "What do you have against me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?"
{Jdg 11:12} 耶弗他打发使者去见亚扪人的王，说：“你与我有什么相干，竟来到我国中攻打我呢？”
{Jdg 11:13} And the king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel on coming up from Egypt took away my land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan; now therefore restore it peaceably."
{Jdg 11:13} 亚扪人的王回答耶弗他的使者说：“因为以色列人从埃及上来的时候占据我的地，从亚嫩河到雅博河，直到约但河。现在你要好好地将这地归还吧！”
{Jdg 11:14} Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites
{Jdg 11:14} 耶弗他又打发使者去见亚扪人的王，
{Jdg 11:15} and said to him, "Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites,
{Jdg 11:15} 对他说：“耶弗他如此说，以色列人并没有占据摩押地和亚扪人的地。
{Jdg 11:16} but when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.
{Jdg 11:16} 以色列人从埃及上来乃是经过旷野到红海，来到加低斯，
{Jdg 11:17} Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let us pass through your land,' but the king of Edom would not listen. And they sent also to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh.
{Jdg 11:17} 就打发使者去见以东王，说：‘求你容我从你的地经过。’以东王却不应允。又照样打发使者去见摩押王，他也不允准。以色列人就住在加低斯。
{Jdg 11:18} "Then they journeyed through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab and arrived on the east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab.
{Jdg 11:18} 他们又经过旷野，绕着以东和摩押地，从摩押地的东边过来，在亚嫩河边安营，并没有入摩押的境内，因为亚嫩河是摩押的边界。
{Jdg 11:19} Israel then sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, 'Please let us pass through your land to our country,'
{Jdg 11:19} 以色列人打发使者去见亚摩利王西宏，就是希实本的王，对他说：‘求你容我们从你的地经过，往我们自己的地方去。’
{Jdg 11:20} but Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory, so Sihon gathered all his people together and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel.
{Jdg 11:20} 西宏却不信服以色列人，不容他们经过他的境界，乃招聚他的众民在雅杂安营，与以色列人争战。
{Jdg 11:21} And the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country.
{Jdg 11:21} 耶和华以色列的} 神将西宏和他的众民都交在以色列人手中，以色列人就击杀他们，得了亚摩利人的全地：
{Jdg 11:22} And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
{Jdg 11:22} 从亚嫩河到雅博河，从旷野直到约但河。
{Jdg 11:23} So then the LORD, the God of Israel, dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel; and are you to take possession of them?
{Jdg 11:23} 耶和华以色列的神在他百姓以色列面前赶出亚摩利人，你竟要得他们的地吗？
{Jdg 11:24} Will you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? And all that the LORD our God has dispossessed before us, we will possess.
{Jdg 11:24} 你的神基抹所赐你的地你不是得为业吗？耶和华我们的神在我们面前所赶出的人，我们就得他的地。
{Jdg 11:25} Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend against Israel, or did he ever go to war with them?
{Jdg 11:25} 难道你比摩押王西拨的儿子巴勒还强吗？他曾与以色列人争竞，或是与他们争战吗？
{Jdg 11:26} While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, 300 years, why did you not deliver them within that time?
{Jdg 11:26} 以色列人住希实本和属希实本的乡村，亚罗珥和属亚罗珥的乡村，并沿亚嫩河的一切城邑，已经有三百年了；在这三百年之内，你们为什么没有取回这些地方呢？
{Jdg 11:27} I therefore have not sinned against you, and you do me wrong by making war on me. The LORD, the Judge, decide this day between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon."
{Jdg 11:27} 原来我没有得罪你，你却攻打我，恶待我。愿审判人的耶和华今日在以色列人和亚扪人中间判断是非。”
{Jdg 11:28} But the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the words of Jephthah that he sent to him.
{Jdg 11:28} 但亚扪人的王不肯听耶弗他打发人说的话。
{Jdg 11:29} Then the Spirit of the LORD was upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites.
{Jdg 11:29} 耶和华的灵降在耶弗他身上，他就经过基列和玛拿西，来到基列的米斯巴，又从米斯巴来到亚扪人那里。
{Jdg 11:30} And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, "If you will give the Ammonites into my hand,
{Jdg 11:30} 耶弗他就向耶和华许愿，说：“你若将亚扪人交在我手中，
{Jdg 11:31} then whatever comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites shall be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering."
{Jdg 11:31} 我从亚扪人那里平平安安回来的时候，无论什么人，先从我家门出来迎接我，就必归你，我也必将他献上为燔祭。”
{Jdg 11:32} So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the LORD gave them into his hand.
{Jdg 11:32} 于是耶弗他往亚扪人那里去，与他们争战；耶和华将他们交在他手中，
{Jdg 11:33} And he struck them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim, with a great blow. So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel.
{Jdg 11:33} 他就大大杀败他们，从亚罗珥到米匿，直到亚备勒基拉明，攻取了二十座城。这样亚扪人就被以色列人制伏了。
{Jdg 11:34} Then Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah. And behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. She was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
{Jdg 11:34} 耶弗他回米斯巴到了自己的家，不料，他女儿拿着鼓跳舞出来迎接他，是他独生的，此外无儿无女。
{Jdg 11:35} And as soon as he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you have become the cause of great trouble to me. For I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot take back my vow."
{Jdg 11:35} 耶弗他看见他，就撕裂衣服，说：“哀哉！我的女儿啊，你使我甚是愁苦，叫我作难了；因为我已经向耶和华开口许愿，不能挽回。”
{Jdg 11:36} And she said to him, "My father, you have opened your mouth to the LORD; do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, now that the LORD has avenged you on your enemies, on the Ammonites."
{Jdg 11:36} 他女儿回答说：“父啊，你既向耶和华开口，就当照你口中所说的向我行，因耶和华已经在仇敌亚扪人身上为你报仇”；
{Jdg 11:37} So she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains and weep for my virginity, I and my companions."
{Jdg 11:37} 又对父亲说：“有一件事求你允准：容我去两个月，与同伴在山上，好哀哭我终为处女。”
{Jdg 11:38} So he said, "Go." Then he sent her away for two months, and she departed, she and her companions, and wept for her virginity on the mountains.
{Jdg 11:38} 耶弗他说：“你去吧！”就容他去两个月。他便和同伴去了，在山上为他终为处女哀哭。
{Jdg 11:39} And at the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow that he had made. She had never known a man, and it became a custom in Israel
{Jdg 11:39} 两月已满，他回到父亲那里，父亲就照所许的愿向他行了。女儿终身没有亲近男子。
{Jdg 11:40} that the daughters of Israel went year by year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
{Jdg 11:40} 此后以色列中有个规矩，每年以色列的女子去为基列人耶弗他的女儿哀哭四天。
{Jdg 12:1}  The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross over to fight against the Ammonites and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire."
{Jdg 12:1}  以法莲人聚集，到了北方，对耶弗他说：“你去与亚扪人争战，为什么没有招我们同去呢？我们必用火烧你和你的房屋。”
{Jdg 12:2}  And Jephthah said to them, "I and my people had a great dispute with the Ammonites, and when I called you, you did not save me from their hand.
{Jdg 12:2}  耶弗他对他们说：“我和我的民与亚扪人大大争战；我招你们来，你们竟没有来救我脱离他们的手。
{Jdg 12:3}  And when I saw that you would not save me, I took my life in my hand and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the LORD gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?"
{Jdg 12:3}  我见你们不来救我，我就拚命前去攻击亚扪人，耶和华将他们交在我手中。你们今日为什么上我这里来攻打我呢？”
{Jdg 12:4}  Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, "You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh."
{Jdg 12:4}  于是耶弗他招聚基列人，与以法莲人争战。基列人击杀以法莲人，是因他们说：“你们基列人在以法莲、玛拿西中间，不过是以法莲逃亡的人。”
{Jdg 12:5}  And the Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, "Let me go over," the men of Gilead said to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" When he said, "No,"
{Jdg 12:5}  基列人把守约但河的渡口，不容以法莲人过去。以法莲逃走的人若说：“容我过去。”基列人就问他说：“你是以法莲人不是？”他若说：“不是”，
{Jdg 12:6}  they said to him, "Then say Shibboleth," and he said, "Sibboleth," for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slaughtered him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time 42,000 of the Ephraimites fell.
{Jdg 12:6}  就对他说：“你说‘示播列’。”；以法莲人因为咬不真字音，便说“西播列”。基列人就将他拿住，杀在约但河的渡口。那时以法莲人被杀的有四万二千人。
{Jdg 12:7}  Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in his city in Gilead.
{Jdg 12:7}  耶弗他作以色列的士师六年。基列人耶弗他死了，葬在基列的一座城里。
{Jdg 12:8}  After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
{Jdg 12:8}  耶弗他以后，有伯利恒人以比赞作以色列的士师。
{Jdg 12:9}  He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he gave in marriage outside his clan, and thirty daughters he brought in from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
{Jdg 12:9}  他有三十个儿子，三十个女儿；女儿都嫁出去了。他给众子从外乡娶了三十个媳妇。他作以色列的士师七年。
{Jdg 12:10} Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
{Jdg 12:10} 以比赞死了，葬在伯利恒。
{Jdg 12:11} After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.
{Jdg 12:11} 以比赞之后，有西布伦人以伦，作以色列的士师十年。
{Jdg 12:12} Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
{Jdg 12:12} 西布伦人以伦死了，葬在西布伦地的亚雅仑。
{Jdg 12:13} After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
{Jdg 12:13} 以伦之后，有比拉顿人希列的儿子押顿作以色列的士师。
{Jdg 12:14} He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys, and he judged Israel eight years.
{Jdg 12:14} 他有四十个儿子，三十个孙子，骑着七十匹驴驹。押顿作以色列的士师八年。
{Jdg 12:15} Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
{Jdg 12:15} 比拉顿人希列的儿子押顿死了，葬在以法莲地的比拉顿，在亚玛力人的山地。
{Jdg 13:1}  And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, so the LORD gave them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.
{Jdg 13:1}  以色列人又行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，耶和华将他们交在非利士人手中四十年。
{Jdg 13:2}  There was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. And his wife was barren and had no children.
{Jdg 13:2}  那时，有一个琐拉人，是属但族的，名叫玛挪亚。他的妻不怀孕，不生育。
{Jdg 13:3}  And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, "Behold, you are barren and have not borne children, but you shall conceive and bear a son.
{Jdg 13:3}  耶和华的使者向那妇人显现，对他说：“向来你不怀孕，不生育，如今你必怀孕生一个儿子。
{Jdg 13:4}  Therefore be careful and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean,
{Jdg 13:4}  所以你当谨慎，清酒浓酒都不可喝，一切不洁之物也不可吃。
{Jdg 13:5}  for behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines."
{Jdg 13:5}  你必怀孕生一个儿子，不可用剃头刀剃他的头，因为这孩子一出胎就归神作拿细耳人。他必起首拯救以色列人脱离非利士人的手。”
{Jdg 13:6}  Then the woman came and told her husband, "A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him where he was from, and he did not tell me his name,
{Jdg 13:6}  妇人就回去对丈夫说：“有一个神人到我面前来，他的相貌如神使者的相貌，甚是可畏。我没有问他从那里来，他也没有将他的名告诉我，
{Jdg 13:7}  but he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.'"
{Jdg 13:7}  却对我说：‘你要怀孕生一个儿子，所以清酒浓酒都不可喝，一切不洁之物也不可吃；因为这孩子从出胎一直到死，必归} 神作拿细耳人。’”
{Jdg 13:8}  Then Manoah prayed to the LORD and said, "O Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us and teach us what we are to do with the child who will be born."
{Jdg 13:8}  玛挪亚就祈求耶和华说：“主啊，求你再差遣那神人到我们这里来，好指教我们怎样待这将要生的孩子。”
{Jdg 13:9}  And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field. But Manoah her husband was not with her.
{Jdg 13:9}  神应允玛挪亚的话；妇人正坐在田间的时候，神的使者又到他那里，他丈夫玛挪亚却没有同他在一处。
{Jdg 13:10} So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, "Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me."
{Jdg 13:10} 妇人急忙跑去告诉丈夫说：“那日到我面前来的人，又向我显现。”
{Jdg 13:11} And Manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to this woman?" And he said, "I am."
{Jdg 13:11} 玛挪亚起来跟随他的妻来到那人面前，对他说：“与这妇人说话的就是你吗？”他说：“是我。”
{Jdg 13:12} And Manoah said, "Now when your words come true, what is to be the child's manner of life, and what is his mission?"
{Jdg 13:12} 玛挪亚说：“愿你的话应验！我们当怎样待这孩子，他后来当怎样呢？”
{Jdg 13:13} And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful.
{Jdg 13:13} 耶和华的使者对玛挪亚说：“我告诉妇人的一切事，他都当谨慎。
{Jdg 13:14} She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe."
{Jdg 13:14} 葡萄树所结的都不可吃，清酒浓酒都不可喝，一切不洁之物也不可吃。凡我所吩咐的，他都当遵守。”
{Jdg 13:15} Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "Please let us detain you and prepare a young goat for you."
{Jdg 13:15} 玛挪亚对耶和华的使者说：“求你容我们款留你，好为你预备一只山羊羔。”
{Jdg 13:16} And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "If you detain me, I will not eat of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the LORD." (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD.)
{Jdg 13:16} 耶和华的使者对玛挪亚说：“你虽然款留我，我却不吃你的食物，你若预备燔祭就当献与耶和华。”原来玛挪亚不知道他是耶和华的使者。
{Jdg 13:17} And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "What is your name, so that, when your words come true, we may honor you?"
{Jdg 13:17} 玛挪亚对耶和华的使者说：“请将你的名告诉我，到你话应验的时候，我们好尊敬你。”
{Jdg 13:18} And the angel of the LORD said to him, "Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?"
{Jdg 13:18} 耶和华的使者对他说：“你何必问我的名，我名是奇妙的。”
{Jdg 13:19} So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the LORD, to the one who works wonders, and Manoah and his wife were watching.
{Jdg 13:19} 玛挪亚将一只山羊羔和素祭在磐石上献与耶和华，使者行奇妙的事；玛挪亚和他的妻观看，
{Jdg 13:20} And when the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the angel of the LORD went up in the flame of the altar. Now Manoah and his wife were watching, and they fell on their faces to the ground.
{Jdg 13:20} 见火焰从坛上往上升，耶和华的使者在坛上的火焰中也升上去了。玛挪亚和他的妻看见，就俯伏于地。
{Jdg 13:21} The angel of the LORD appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD.
{Jdg 13:21} 耶和华的使者不再向玛挪亚和他的妻显现，玛挪亚才知道他是耶和华的使者。
{Jdg 13:22} And Manoah said to his wife, "We shall surely die, for we have seen God."
{Jdg 13:22} 玛挪亚对他的妻说：“我们必要死，因为看见了神。”
{Jdg 13:23} But his wife said to him, "If the LORD had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us such things as these."
{Jdg 13:23} 他的妻却对他说：“耶和华若要杀我们，必不从我们手里收纳燔祭和素祭，并不将这一切事指示我们，今日也不将这些话告诉我们。”
{Jdg 13:24} And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson. And the young man grew, and the LORD blessed him.
{Jdg 13:24} 后来妇人生了一个儿子，给他起名叫参孙。孩子长大，耶和华赐福与他。
{Jdg 13:25} And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
{Jdg 13:25} 在玛哈尼但，就是琐拉和以实陶中间，耶和华的灵才感动他。
{Jdg 14:1}  Samson went down to Timnah, and at Timnah he saw one of the daughters of the Philistines.
{Jdg 14:1}  参孙下到亭拿，在那里看见一个女子，是非利士人的女儿。
{Jdg 14:2}  Then he came up and told his father and mother, "I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah. Now get her for me as my wife."
{Jdg 14:2}  参孙上来禀告他父母说：“我在亭拿看见一个女子，是非利士人的女儿，愿你们给我娶来为妻。”
{Jdg 14:3}  But his father and mother said to him, "Is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" But Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes."
{Jdg 14:3}  他父母说：“在你弟兄的女儿中，或在本国的民中，岂没有一个女子，何至你去在未受割礼的非利士人中娶妻呢？”参孙对他父亲说：“愿你给我娶那女子，因我喜悦他。”
{Jdg 14:4}  His father and mother did not know that it was from the LORD, for he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines ruled over Israel.
{Jdg 14:4}  他的父母却不知道这事是出于耶和华，因为他找机会攻击非利士人。那时，非利士人辖制以色列人。
{Jdg 14:5}  Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion came toward him roaring.
{Jdg 14:5}  参孙跟他父母下亭拿去，到了亭拿的葡萄园，见有一只少壮狮子向他吼叫。
{Jdg 14:6}  Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
{Jdg 14:6}  耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他虽然手无器械，却将狮子撕裂，如同撕裂山羊羔一样。他行这事并没有告诉父母。
{Jdg 14:7}  Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she was right in Samson's eyes.
{Jdg 14:7}  参孙下去与女子说话，就喜悦他；
{Jdg 14:8}  After some days he returned to take her. And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
{Jdg 14:8}  过了些日子，再下去要娶那女子，转向道旁要看死狮，见有一群蜂子和蜜在死狮之内，
{Jdg 14:9}  He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion.
{Jdg 14:9}  就用手取蜜，且吃且走；到了父母那里，给他父母，他们也吃了；只是没有告诉这蜜是从死狮之内取来的。
{Jdg 14:10} His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, for so the young men used to do.
{Jdg 14:10} 他父亲下去见女子。参孙在那里设摆筵宴，因为向来少年人都有这个规矩。
{Jdg 14:11} As soon as the people saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.
{Jdg 14:11} 众人看见参孙，就请了三十个人陪伴他。
{Jdg 14:12} And Samson said to them, "Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can tell me what it is, within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes,
{Jdg 14:12} 参孙对他们说：“我给你们出一个谜语，你们在七日筵宴之内，若能猜出意思告诉我，我就给你们三十件里衣，三十套衣裳；
{Jdg 14:13} but if you cannot tell me what it is, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes." And they said to him, "Put your riddle, that we may hear it."
{Jdg 14:13} 你们若不能猜出意思告诉我，你们就给我三十件里衣，三十套衣裳。”他们说：“请将谜语说给我们听。”
{Jdg 14:14} And he said to them, "Out of the eater came something to eat. Out of the strong came something sweet." And in three days they could not solve the riddle.
{Jdg 14:14} 参孙对他们说：吃的从吃者出来；甜的从强者出来。他们三日不能猜出谜语的意思。
{Jdg 14:15} On the fourth day they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle is, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us here to impoverish us?"
{Jdg 14:15} 到第七天，他们对参孙的妻说：“你诓哄你丈夫，探出谜语的意思告诉我们，免得我们用火烧你和你父家。你们请了我们来，是要夺我们所有的吗？”
{Jdg 14:16} And Samson's wife wept over him and said, "You only hate me; you do not love me. You have put a riddle to my people, and you have not told me what it is." And he said to her, "Behold, I have not told my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?"
{Jdg 14:16} 参孙的妻在丈夫面前啼哭说：“你是恨我，不是爱我，你给我本国的人出谜语，却没有将意思告诉我。”参孙回答说：“连我父母我都没有告诉，岂可告诉你呢？”
{Jdg 14:17} She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told the riddle to her people.
{Jdg 14:17} 七日筵宴之内，他在丈夫面前啼哭，到第七天逼着他，他才将谜语的意思告诉他妻，他妻就告诉本国的人。
{Jdg 14:18} And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" And he said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle."
{Jdg 14:18} 到第七天，日头未落以前，那城里的人对参孙说：有什么比蜜还甜呢？有什么比狮子还强呢？参孙对他们说：你们若非用我的母牛犊耕地，就猜不出我谜语的意思来。
{Jdg 14:19} And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down thirty men of the town and took their spoil and gave the garments to those who had told the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father's house.
{Jdg 14:19} 耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他就下到亚实基伦，击杀了三十个人，夺了他们的衣裳，将衣裳给了猜出谜语的人。参孙发怒，就上父家去了。
{Jdg 14:20} And Samson's wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.
{Jdg 14:20} 参孙的妻便归了参孙的陪伴，就是作过他朋友的。
{Jdg 15:1}  After some days, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat. And he said, "I will go in to my wife in the chamber." But her father would not allow him to go in.
{Jdg 15:1}  过了些日子，到割麦子的时候，参孙带着一只山羊羔去看他的妻，说：“我要进内室见我的妻。”他岳父不容他进去，
{Jdg 15:2}  And her father said, "I really thought that you utterly hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead."
{Jdg 15:2}  说：“我估定你是极其恨他，因此我将他给了你的陪伴。他的妹子不是比他还美丽吗？你可以娶来代替他吧！”
{Jdg 15:3}  And Samson said to them, "This time I shall be innocent in regard to the Philistines, when I do them harm."
{Jdg 15:3}  参孙说：“这回我加害于非利士人不算有罪。”
{Jdg 15:4}  So Samson went and caught 300 foxes and took torches. And he turned them tail to tail and put a torch between each pair of tails.
{Jdg 15:4}  于是参孙去捉了三百只狐狸（或作：野狗），将狐狸尾巴一对一对地捆上，将火把捆在两条尾巴中间，
{Jdg 15:5}  And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and set fire to the stacked grain and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards.
{Jdg 15:5}  点着火把，就放狐狸进入非利士人站着的禾稼，将堆集的禾捆和未割的禾稼，并橄榄园尽都烧了。
{Jdg 15:6}  Then the Philistines said, "Who has done this?" And they said, "Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion." And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.
{Jdg 15:6}  非利士人说：“这事是谁做的呢？”有人说：“是亭拿人的女婿参孙，因为他岳父将他的妻给了他的陪伴。”于是非利士人上去，用火烧了妇人和他的父亲。
{Jdg 15:7}  And Samson said to them, "If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged on you, and after that I will quit."
{Jdg 15:7}  参孙对非利士人说：“你们既然这样行，我必向你们报仇才肯罢休。”
{Jdg 15:8}  And he struck them hip and thigh with a great blow, and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
{Jdg 15:8}  参孙就大大击杀他们，连腿带腰都砍断了。他便下去，住在以坦磐的穴内。
{Jdg 15:9}  Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi.
{Jdg 15:9}  非利士人上去安营在犹大，布散在利希。
{Jdg 15:10} And the men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" They said, "We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us."
{Jdg 15:10} 犹大人说：“你们为何上来攻击我们呢？”他们说：“我们上来是要捆绑参孙；他向我们怎样行，我们也要向他怎样行。”
{Jdg 15:11} Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?" And he said to them, "As they did to me, so have I done to them."
{Jdg 15:11} 于是有三千犹大人下到以坦磐的穴内，对参孙说：“非利士人辖制我们，你不知道吗？你向我们行的是什么事呢？”他回答说：“他们向我怎样行，我也要向他们怎样行。”
{Jdg 15:12} And they said to him, "We have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines." And Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves."
{Jdg 15:12} 犹大人对他说：“我们下来是要捆绑你，将你交在非利士人手中。”参孙说：“你们要向我起誓，应承你们自己不害死我。”
{Jdg 15:13} They said to him, "No; we will only bind you and give you into their hands. We will surely not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
{Jdg 15:13} 他们说：“我们断不杀你，只要将你捆绑交在非利士人手中。”于是用两条新绳捆绑参孙，将他从以坦磐带上去。
{Jdg 15:14} When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands.
{Jdg 15:14} 参孙到了利希，非利士人都迎着喧嚷。耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他臂上的绳就像火烧的麻一样，他的绑绳都从他手上脱落下来。
{Jdg 15:15} And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put out his hand and took it, and with it he struck 1,000 men.
{Jdg 15:15} 他见一块未干的驴腮骨，就伸手拾起来，用以击杀一千人。
{Jdg 15:16} And Samson said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey have I struck down a thousand men."
{Jdg 15:16} 参孙说：我用驴腮骨杀人成堆，用驴腮骨杀了一千人。
{Jdg 15:17} As soon as he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand. And that place was called Ramath-lehi.
{Jdg 15:17} 说完这话，就把那腮骨从手里抛出去了。那地便叫拉末利希。
{Jdg 15:18} And he was very thirsty, and he called upon the LORD and said, "You have granted this great salvation by the hand of your servant, and shall I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
{Jdg 15:18} 参孙甚觉口渴，就求告耶和华说：“你既藉仆人的手施行这么大的拯救，岂可任我渴死、落在未受割礼的人手中呢？”
{Jdg 15:19} And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out from it. And when he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore; it is at Lehi to this day.
{Jdg 15:19} 神就使利希的洼处裂开，有水从其中涌出来。参孙喝了，精神复原；因此那泉名叫隐哈歌利，那泉直到今日还在利希。
{Jdg 15:20} And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
{Jdg 15:20} 当非利士人辖制以色列人的时候，参孙作以色列的士师二十年。
{Jdg 16:1}  Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a prostitute, and he went in to her.
{Jdg 16:1}  参孙到了迦萨，在那里看见一个妓女，就与他亲近。
{Jdg 16:2}  The Gazites were told, "Samson has come here." And they surrounded the place and set an ambush for him all night at the gate of the city. They kept quiet all night, saying, "Let us wait till the light of the morning; then we will kill him."
{Jdg 16:2}  有人告诉迦萨人说：“参孙到这里来了！”他们就把他团团围住，终夜在城门悄悄埋伏，说：“等到天亮我们便杀他。”
{Jdg 16:3}  But Samson lay till midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts, and pulled them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that is in front of Hebron.
{Jdg 16:3}  参孙睡到半夜，起来，将城门的门扇、门框、门闩，一齐拆下来，扛在肩上，扛到希伯仑前的山顶上。
{Jdg 16:4}  After this he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
{Jdg 16:4}  后来，参孙在梭烈谷喜爱一个妇人，名叫大利拉。
{Jdg 16:5}  And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, "Seduce him, and see where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to humble him. And we will each give you 1,100 pieces of silver."
{Jdg 16:5}  非利士人的首领上去见那妇人，对他说：“求你诓哄参孙，探探他因何有这么大的力气，我们用何法能胜他，捆绑克制他。我们就每人给你一千一百舍客勒银子。”
{Jdg 16:6}  So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me where your great strength lies, and how you might be bound, that one could subdue you."
{Jdg 16:6}  大利拉对参孙说：“求你告诉我，你因何有这么大的力气，当用何法捆绑克制你。”
{Jdg 16:7}  Samson said to her, "If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, then I shall become weak and be like any other man."
{Jdg 16:7}  参孙回答说：“人若用七条未干的青绳子捆绑我，我就软弱像别人一样。”
{Jdg 16:8}  Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
{Jdg 16:8}  于是非利士人的首领拿了七条未干的青绳子来，交给妇人，他就用绳子捆绑参孙。
{Jdg 16:9}  Now she had men lying in ambush in an inner chamber. And she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he snapped the bowstrings, as a thread of flax snaps when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.
{Jdg 16:9}  有人预先埋伏在妇人的内室里。妇人说：“参孙哪，非利士人拿你来了！”参孙就挣断绳子，如挣断经火的麻线一般。这样，他力气的根由人还是不知道。
{Jdg 16:10} Then Delilah said to Samson, "Behold, you have mocked me and told me lies. Please tell me how you might be bound."
{Jdg 16:10} 大利拉对参孙说：“你欺哄我，向我说谎言。现在求你告诉我当用何法捆绑你。”
{Jdg 16:11} And he said to her, "If they bind me with new ropes that have not been used, then I shall become weak and be like any other man."
{Jdg 16:11} 参孙回答说：“人若用没有使过的新绳捆绑我，我就软弱像别人一样。”
{Jdg 16:12} So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And the men lying in ambush were in an inner chamber. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.
{Jdg 16:12} 大利拉就用新绳捆绑他，对他说：“参孙哪，非利士人拿你来了！”有人预先埋伏在内室里。参孙将臂上的绳挣断了，如挣断一条线一样。
{Jdg 16:13} Then Delilah said to Samson, "Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me how you might be bound." And he said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and fasten it tight with the pin, then I shall become weak and be like any other man."
{Jdg 16:13} 大利拉对参孙说：“你到如今还是欺哄我，向我说谎言。求你告诉我，当用何法捆绑你。”参孙回答说：“你若将我头上的七条发绺，与纬线同织就可以了。”
{Jdg 16:14} So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web. And she made them tight with the pin and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web.
{Jdg 16:14} 于是大利拉将他的发绺与纬线同织，用橛子钉住，对他说：“参孙哪，非利士人拿你来了！”参孙从睡中醒来，将机上的橛子和纬线一齐都拔出来了。
{Jdg 16:15} And she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and you have not told me where your great strength lies."
{Jdg 16:15} 大利拉对参孙说：“你既不与我同心，怎么说你爱我呢？你这三次欺哄我，没有告诉我，你因何有这么大的力气。”
{Jdg 16:16} And when she pressed him hard with her words day after day, and urged him, his soul was vexed to death.
{Jdg 16:16} 大利拉天天用话催逼他，甚至他心里烦闷要死。
{Jdg 16:17} And he told her all his heart, and said to her, "A razor has never come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If my head is shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak and be like any other man."
{Jdg 16:17} 参孙就把心中所藏的都告诉了他，对他说：“向来人没有用剃头刀剃我的头，因为我自出母胎就归} 神作拿细耳人；若剃了我的头发，我的力气就离开我，我便软弱像别人一样。”
{Jdg 16:18} When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up again, for he has told me all his heart." Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands.
{Jdg 16:18} 大利拉见他把心中所藏的都告诉了他，就打发人到非利士人的首领那里，对他们说：“他已经把心中所藏的都告诉了我，请你们再上来一次。”于是非利士人的首领手里拿着银子，上到妇人那里。
{Jdg 16:19} She made him sleep on her knees. And she called a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him.
{Jdg 16:19} 大利拉使参孙枕着他的膝睡觉，叫了一个人来剃除他头上的七条发绺。于是大利拉克制他，他的力气就离开他了。
{Jdg 16:20} And she said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And he awoke from his sleep and said, "I will go out as at other times and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had left him.
{Jdg 16:20} 大利拉说：“参孙哪，非利士人拿你来了！”参孙从睡中醒来，心里说：“我要像前几次出去活动身体”；他却不知道耶和华已经离开他了。
{Jdg 16:21} And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles. And he ground at the mill in the prison.
{Jdg 16:21} 非利士人将他拿住，剜了他的眼睛，带他下到迦萨，用铜链拘索他；他就在监里推磨。
{Jdg 16:22} But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
{Jdg 16:22} 然而他的头发被剃之后，又渐渐长起来了。
{Jdg 16:23} Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice, and they said, "Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand."
{Jdg 16:23} 非利士人的首领聚集，要给他们的神大衮献大祭，并且欢乐，因为他们说：“我们的神将我们的仇敌参孙交在我们手中了。”
{Jdg 16:24} And when the people saw him, they praised their god. For they said, "Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the ravager of our country, who has killed many of us."
{Jdg 16:24} 众人看见参孙，就赞美他们的神说：“我们的神将毁坏我们地、杀害我们许多人的仇敌交在我们手中了。”
{Jdg 16:25} And when their hearts were merry, they said, "Call Samson, that he may entertain us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars.
{Jdg 16:25} 他们正宴乐的时候，就说：“叫参孙来，在我们面前戏耍戏耍。”于是将参孙从监里提出来，他就在众人面前戏耍。他们使他站在两柱中间。
{Jdg 16:26} And Samson said to the young man who held him by the hand, "Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them."
{Jdg 16:26} 参孙向拉他手的童子说：“求你让我摸着托房的柱子，我要靠一靠。”
{Jdg 16:27} Now the house was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about 3,000 men and women, who looked on while Samson entertained.
{Jdg 16:27} 那时房内充满男女，非利士人的众首领也都在那里。房的平顶上约有三千男女观看参孙戏耍。
{Jdg 16:28} Then Samson called to the LORD and said, "O Lord GOD, please remember me and please strengthen me only this once, O God, that I may be avenged on the Philistines for my two eyes."
{Jdg 16:28} 参孙求告耶和华说：“主耶和华啊，求你眷念我。}   神啊，求你赐我这一次的力量，使我在非利士人身上报那剜我双眼的仇。”
{Jdg 16:29} And Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and he leaned his weight against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other.
{Jdg 16:29} 参孙就抱住托房的那两根柱子：左手抱一根，右手抱一根，
{Jdg 16:30} And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." Then he bowed with all his strength, and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he had killed during his life.
{Jdg 16:30} 说：“我情愿与非利士人同死！”就尽力屈身，房子倒塌，压住首领和房内的众人。这样，参孙死时所杀的人比活着所杀的还多。
{Jdg 16:31} Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel twenty years.
{Jdg 16:31} 参孙的弟兄和他父的全家都下去取他的尸首，抬上来葬在琐拉和以实陶中间，在他父玛挪亚的坟墓里。参孙作以色列的士师二十年。
{Jdg 17:1}  There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
{Jdg 17:1}  以法莲山地有一个人名叫米迦。
{Jdg 17:2}  And he said to his mother, "The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son by the LORD."
{Jdg 17:2}  他对母亲说：“你那一千一百舍客勒银子被人拿去，你因此咒诅，并且告诉了我。看哪，这银子在我这里，是我拿去了。”他母亲说：“我儿啊，愿耶和华赐福与你！”
{Jdg 17:3}  And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, "I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you."
{Jdg 17:3}  米迦就把这一千一百舍客勒银子还他母亲。他母亲说：“我分出这银子来为你献给耶和华，好雕刻一个像，铸成一个像。现在我还是交给你。”
{Jdg 17:4}  So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah.
{Jdg 17:4}  米迦将银子还他母亲，他母亲将二百舍客勒银子交给银匠，雕刻一个像，铸成一个像，安置在米迦的屋内。
{Jdg 17:5}  And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and ordained one of his sons, who became his priest.
{Jdg 17:5}  这米迦有了神堂，又制造以弗得和家中的神像，分派他一个儿子作祭司。
{Jdg 17:6}  In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
{Jdg 17:6}  那时以色列中没有王，各人任意而行。
{Jdg 17:7}  Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
{Jdg 17:7}  犹大的伯利恒有一个少年人，是犹大族的利未人，他在那里寄居。
{Jdg 17:8}  And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.
{Jdg 17:8}  这人离开犹大的伯利恒城，要找一个可住的地方。行路的时候，到了以法莲山地，走到米迦的家。
{Jdg 17:9}  And Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place."
{Jdg 17:9}  米迦问他说：“你从那里来？”他回答说：“从犹大的伯利恒来。我是利未人，要找一个可住的地方。”
{Jdg 17:10} And Micah said to him, "Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living." And the Levite went in.
{Jdg 17:10} 米迦说：“你可以住在我这里，我以你为父、为祭司。我每年给你十舍客勒银子，一套衣服和度日的食物。”利未人就进了他的家。
{Jdg 17:11} And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons.
{Jdg 17:11} 利未人情愿与那人同住；那人看这少年人如自己的儿子一样。
{Jdg 17:12} And Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
{Jdg 17:12} 米迦分派这少年的利未人作祭司，他就住在米迦的家里。
{Jdg 17:13} Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest."
{Jdg 17:13} 米迦说：“现在我知道耶和华必赐福与我，因我有一个利未人作祭司。”
{Jdg 18:1}  In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the people of Dan was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for until then no inheritance among the tribes of Israel had fallen to them.
{Jdg 18:1}  那时，以色列中没有王。但支派的人仍是寻地居住；因为到那日子，他们还没有在以色列支派中得地为业。
{Jdg 18:2}  So the people of Dan sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, "Go and explore the land." And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
{Jdg 18:2}  但人从琐拉和以实陶打发本族中的五个勇士，去仔细窥探那地，吩咐他们说：“你们去窥探那地。”他们来到以法莲山地，进了米迦的住宅，就在那里住宿。
{Jdg 18:3}  When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. And they turned aside and said to him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?"
{Jdg 18:3}  他们临近米迦的住宅，听出那少年利未人的口音来，就进去问他说：“谁领你到这里来？你在这里做什么？你在这里得什么？”
{Jdg 18:4}  And he said to them, "This is how Micah dealt with me: he has hired me, and I have become his priest."
{Jdg 18:4}  他回答说：“米迦待我如此如此，请我作祭司。”
{Jdg 18:5}  And they said to him, "Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed."
{Jdg 18:5}  他们对他说：“请你求问神，使我们知道所行的道路通达不通达。”
{Jdg 18:6}  And the priest said to them, "Go in peace. The journey on which you go is under the eye of the LORD."
{Jdg 18:6}  祭司对他们说：“你们可以平平安安的去，你们所行的道路是在耶和华面前的。”
{Jdg 18:7}  Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing that is in the earth and possessing wealth, and how they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.
{Jdg 18:7}  五人就走了，来到拉亿，见那里的民安居无虑，如同西顿人安居一样。在那地没有人掌权扰乱他们；他们离西顿人也远，与别人没有来往。
{Jdg 18:8}  And when they came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, "What do you report?"
{Jdg 18:8}  五人回到琐拉和以实陶，见他们的弟兄；弟兄问他们说：“你们有什么话？”
{Jdg 18:9}  They said, "Arise, and let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, to enter in and possess the land.
{Jdg 18:9}  他们回答说：“起来，我们上去攻击他们吧！我们已经窥探那地，见那地甚好。你们为何静坐不动呢？要急速前往得那地为业，不可迟延。
{Jdg 18:10} As soon as you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is spacious, for God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth."
{Jdg 18:10} 你们到了那里，必看见安居无虑的民，地也宽阔。}   神已将那地交在你们手中；那地百物俱全，一无所缺。”
{Jdg 18:11} So 600 men of the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol,
{Jdg 18:11} 于是但族中的六百人，各带兵器，从琐拉和以实陶前往，
{Jdg 18:12} and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim.
{Jdg 18:12} 上到犹大的基列耶琳，在基列耶琳后边安营。因此那地方名叫玛哈尼但，直到今日。
{Jdg 18:13} And they passed on from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
{Jdg 18:13} 他们从那里往以法莲山地去，来到米迦的住宅。
{Jdg 18:14} Then the five men who had gone to scout out the country of Laish said to their brothers, "Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household gods, a carved image, and a metal image? Now therefore consider what you will do."
{Jdg 18:14} 从前窥探拉亿地的五个人对他们的弟兄说：“这宅子里有以弗得和家中的神像，并雕刻的像与铸成的像，你们知道吗？现在你们要想一想当怎样行。”
{Jdg 18:15} And they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him about his welfare.
{Jdg 18:15} 五人就进入米迦的住宅，到了那少年利未人的房内问他好。
{Jdg 18:16} Now the 600 men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate.
{Jdg 18:16} 那六百但人各带兵器，站在门口。
{Jdg 18:17} And the five men who had gone to scout out the land went up and entered and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war.
{Jdg 18:17} 窥探地的五个人走进去，将雕刻的像、以弗得、家中的神像，并铸成的像，都拿了去。祭司和带兵器的六百人，一同站在门口。
{Jdg 18:18} And when these went into Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"
{Jdg 18:18} 那五个人进入米迦的住宅，拿出雕刻的像、以弗得、家中的神像，并铸成的像，祭司就问他们说：“你们做什么呢？”
{Jdg 18:19} And they said to him, "Keep quiet; put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?"
{Jdg 18:19} 他们回答说：“不要作声，用手捂口，跟我们去吧！我们必以你为父、为祭司。你作一家的祭司好呢？还是作以色列一族一支派的祭司好呢？”
{Jdg 18:20} And the priest's heart was glad. He took the ephod and the household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.
{Jdg 18:20} 祭司心里喜悦，便拿着以弗得和家中的神像，并雕刻的像，进入他们中间。
{Jdg 18:21} So they turned and departed, putting the little ones and the livestock and the goods in front of them.
{Jdg 18:21} 他们就转身离开那里，妻子、儿女、牲畜、财物都在前头。
{Jdg 18:22} When they had gone a distance from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah's house were called out, and they overtook the people of Dan.
{Jdg 18:22} 离米迦的住宅已远，米迦的近邻都聚集来，追赶但人，
{Jdg 18:23} And they shouted to the people of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, "What is the matter with you, that you come with such a company?"
{Jdg 18:23} 呼叫但人。但人回头问米迦说：“你聚集这许多人来做什么呢？”
{Jdg 18:24} And he said, "You take my gods that I made and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then do you ask me, 'What is the matter with you?'"
{Jdg 18:24} 米迦说：“你们将我所做的神像和祭司都带了去，我还有所剩的吗？怎么还问我说‘做什么’呢？”
{Jdg 18:25} And the people of Dan said to him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household."
{Jdg 18:25} 但人对米迦说：“你不要使我们听见你的声音，恐怕有性暴的人攻击你，以致你和你的全家尽都丧命。”
{Jdg 18:26} Then the people of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.
{Jdg 18:26} 但人还是走他们的路。米迦见他们的势力比自己强盛，就转身回家去了。
{Jdg 18:27} But the people of Dan took what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, and they came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.
{Jdg 18:27} 但人将米迦所做的神像和他的祭司都带到拉亿，见安居无虑的民，就用刀杀了那民，又放火烧了那城，
{Jdg 18:28} And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. Then they rebuilt the city and lived in it.
{Jdg 18:28} 并无人搭救；因为离西顿远，他们又与别人没有来往。城在平原，那平原靠近伯利合。但人又在那里修城居住，
{Jdg 18:29} And they named the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was Laish at the first.
{Jdg 18:29} 照着他们始祖以色列之子但的名字，给那城起名叫但；原先那城名叫拉亿。
{Jdg 18:30} And the people of Dan set up the carved image for themselves, and Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
{Jdg 18:30} 但人就为自己设立那雕刻的像。摩西的孙子、革舜的儿子约拿单，和他的子孙作但支派的祭司，直到那地遭掳掠的日子。
{Jdg 18:31} So they set up Micah's carved image that he made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.
{Jdg 18:31} 神的殿在示罗多少日子，但人为自己设立米迦所雕刻的像也在但多少日子。
{Jdg 19:1}  In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
{Jdg 19:1}  当以色列中没有王的时候，有住以法莲山地那边的一个利未人，娶了一个犹大伯利恒的女子为妾。
{Jdg 19:2}  And his concubine was unfaithful to him, and she went away from him to her father's house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four months.
{Jdg 19:2}  妾行淫离开丈夫，回犹大的伯利恒，到了父家，在那里住了四个月。
{Jdg 19:3}  Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father's house. And when the girl's father saw him, he came with joy to meet him.
{Jdg 19:3}  他丈夫起来，带着一个仆人、两匹驴去见他，用好话劝他回来。女子就引丈夫进入父家。他父见了那人，便欢欢喜喜地迎接。
{Jdg 19:4}  And his father-in-law, the girl's father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and spent the night there.
{Jdg 19:4}  那人的岳父，就是女子的父亲，将那人留下住了三天。于是二人一同吃喝、住宿。
{Jdg 19:5}  And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he prepared to go, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may go."
{Jdg 19:5}  到第四天，利未人清早起来要走，女子的父亲对女婿说：“请你吃点饭，加添心力，然后可以行路。”
{Jdg 19:6}  So the two of them sat and ate and drank together. And the girl's father said to the man, "Be pleased to spend the night, and let your heart be merry."
{Jdg 19:6}  于是二人坐下一同吃喝。女子的父亲对那人说：“请你再住一夜，畅快你的心。”
{Jdg 19:7}  And when the man rose up to go, his father-in-law pressed him, till he spent the night there again.
{Jdg 19:7}  那人起来要走，他岳父强留他，他又住了一宿。
{Jdg 19:8}  And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart. And the girl's father said, "Strengthen your heart and wait until the day declines." So they ate, both of them.
{Jdg 19:8}  到第五天，他清早起来要走，女子的父亲说：“请你吃点饭，加添心力，等到日头偏西再走。”于是二人一同吃饭。
{Jdg 19:9}  And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Behold, now the day has waned toward evening. Please, spend the night. Behold, the day draws to its close. Lodge here and let your heart be merry, and tomorrow you shall arise early in the morning for your journey, and go home."
{Jdg 19:9}  那人同他的妾和仆人起来要走，他岳父，就是女子的父亲，对他说：“看哪，日头偏西了，请你再住一夜；天快晚了，可以在这里住宿，畅快你的心。明天早早起行回家去。”
{Jdg 19:10} But the man would not spend the night. He rose up and departed and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was with him.
{Jdg 19:10} 那人不愿再住一夜，就备上那两匹驴，带着妾起身走了，来到耶布斯的对面（耶布斯就是耶路撒冷。）
{Jdg 19:11} When they were near Jebus, the day was nearly over, and the servant said to his master, "Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it."
{Jdg 19:11} 临近耶布斯的时候，日头快要落了，仆人对主人说：“我们不如进这耶布斯人的城里住宿。”
{Jdg 19:12} And his master said to him, "We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel, but we will pass on to Gibeah."
{Jdg 19:12} 主人回答说：“我们不可进不是以色列人住的外邦城，不如过到基比亚去”；
{Jdg 19:13} And he said to his young man, "Come and let us draw near to one of these places and spend the night at Gibeah or at Ramah."
{Jdg 19:13} 又对仆人说：“我们可以到一个地方，或住在基比亚，或住在拉玛。”
{Jdg 19:14} So they passed on and went their way. And the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin,
{Jdg 19:14} 他们就往前走。将到便雅悯的基比亚，日头已经落了；
{Jdg 19:15} and they turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at Gibeah. And he went in and sat down in the open square of the city, for no one took them into his house to spend the night.
{Jdg 19:15} 他们进入基比亚要在那里住宿，就坐在城里的街上，因为无人接他们进家住宿。
{Jdg 19:16} And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. The man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was sojourning in Gibeah. The men of the place were Benjaminites.
{Jdg 19:16} 晚上，有一个老年人从田间做工回来。他原是以法莲山地的人，住在基比亚；那地方的人却是便雅悯人。
{Jdg 19:17} And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city. And the old man said, "Where are you going? And where do you come from?"
{Jdg 19:17} 老年人举目看见客人坐在城里的街上，就问他说：“你从那里来？要往那里去？”
{Jdg 19:18} And he said to him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, from which I come. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to the house of the Lord, but no one has taken me into his house.
{Jdg 19:18} 他回答说：“我们从犹大的伯利恒来，要往以法莲山地那边去。我原是那里的人，到过犹大的伯利恒，现在我往耶和华的殿去，在这里无人接我进他的家。
{Jdg 19:19} We have straw and feed for our donkeys, with bread and wine for me and your female servant and the young man with your servants. There is no lack of anything."
{Jdg 19:19} 其实我有粮草可以喂驴，我与我的妾，并我的仆人，有饼有酒，并不缺少什么。”
{Jdg 19:20} And the old man said, "Peace be to you; I will care for all your wants. Only, do not spend the night in the square."
{Jdg 19:20} 老年人说：“愿你平安！你所需用的我都给你，只是不可在街上过夜。”
{Jdg 19:21} So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys feed. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
{Jdg 19:21} 于是领他们到家里，喂上驴，他们就洗脚吃喝。
{Jdg 19:22} As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, worthless fellows, surrounded the house, beating on the door. And they said to the old man, the master of the house, "Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him."
{Jdg 19:22} 他们心里正欢畅的时候，城中的匪徒围住房子，连连叩门，对房主老人说：“你把那进你家的人带出来，我们要与他交合。”
{Jdg 19:23} And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, "No, my brothers, do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not do this vile thing.
{Jdg 19:23} 那房主出来对他们说：“弟兄们哪，不要这样作恶；这人既然进了我的家，你们就不要行这丑事。
{Jdg 19:24} Behold, here are my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out now. Violate them and do with them what seems good to you, but against this man do not do this outrageous thing."
{Jdg 19:24} 我有个女儿，还是处女，并有这人的妾，我将他们领出来任凭你们玷辱他们，只是向这人不可行这样的丑事。”
{Jdg 19:25} But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and made her go out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go.
{Jdg 19:25} 那些人却不听从他的话。那人就把他的妾拉出去交给他们，他们便与他交合，终夜凌辱他，直到天色快亮才放他去。
{Jdg 19:26} And as morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man's house where her master was, until it was light.
{Jdg 19:26} 天快亮的时候，妇人回到他主人住宿的房门前，就仆倒在地，直到天亮。
{Jdg 19:27} And her master rose up in the morning, and when he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, behold, there was his concubine lying at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
{Jdg 19:27} 早晨，他的主人起来开了房门，出去要行路，不料那妇人仆倒在房门前，两手搭在门槛上；
{Jdg 19:28} He said to her, "Get up, let us be going." But there was no answer. Then he put her on the donkey, and the man rose up and went away to his home.
{Jdg 19:28} 就对妇人说：“起来，我们走吧！”妇人却不回答。那人便将他驮在驴上，起身回本处去了。
{Jdg 19:29} And when he entered his house, he took a knife, and taking hold of his concubine he divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.
{Jdg 19:29} 到了家里，用刀将妾的尸身切成十二块，使人拿着传送以色列的四境。
{Jdg 19:30} And all who saw it said, "Such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the people of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak."
{Jdg 19:30} 凡看见的人都说：“从以色列人出埃及地，直到今日，这样的事没有行过，也没有见过。现在应当思想，大家商议当怎样办理。”
{Jdg 20:1}  Then all the people of Israel came out, from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, and the congregation assembled as one man to the LORD at Mizpah.
{Jdg 20:1}  于是以色列从但到别是巴，以及住基列地的众人都出来，如同一人，聚集在米斯巴耶和华面前。
{Jdg 20:2}  And the chiefs of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, 400,000 men on foot that drew the sword.
{Jdg 20:2}  以色列民的首领，就是各支派的军长，都站在神百姓的会中；拿刀的步兵共有四十万。
{Jdg 20:3}  (Now the people of Benjamin heard that the people of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the people of Israel said, "Tell us, how did this evil happen?"
{Jdg 20:3}  以色列人上到米斯巴，便雅悯人都听见了。以色列人说：“请你将这件恶事的情由对我们说明。”
{Jdg 20:4}  And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, "I came to Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.
{Jdg 20:4}  那利未人，就是被害之妇人的丈夫，回答说：“我和我的妾到了便雅悯的基比亚住宿。
{Jdg 20:5}  And the leaders of Gibeah rose against me and surrounded the house against me by night. They meant to kill me, and they violated my concubine, and she is dead.
{Jdg 20:5}  基比亚人夜间起来，围了我住的房子，想要杀我，又将我的妾强奸致死。
{Jdg 20:6}  So I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel, for they have committed abomination and outrage in Israel.
{Jdg 20:6}  我就把我妾的尸身切成块子，使人拿着传送以色列得为业的全地，因为基比亚人在以色列中行了凶淫丑恶的事。
{Jdg 20:7}  Behold, you people of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here."
{Jdg 20:7}  你们以色列人都当筹划商议。”
{Jdg 20:8}  And all the people arose as one man, saying, "None of us will go to his tent, and none of us will return to his house.
{Jdg 20:8}  众民都起来如同一人，说：“我们连一人都不回自己帐棚、自己房屋去。
{Jdg 20:9}  But now this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot,
{Jdg 20:9}  我们向基比亚人必这样行，照所掣的签去攻击他们。
{Jdg 20:10} and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of ten thousand, to bring provisions for the people, that when they come they may repay Gibeah of Benjamin, for all the outrage that they have committed in Israel."
{Jdg 20:10} 我们要在以色列各支派中，一百人挑取十人，一千人挑取百人，一万人挑取千人，为民运粮，等大众到了便雅悯的基比亚，就照基比亚人在以色列中所行的丑事征伐他们。”
{Jdg 20:11} So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one man.
{Jdg 20:11} 于是以色列众人彼此连合如同一人，聚集攻击那城。
{Jdg 20:12} And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What evil is this that has taken place among you?
{Jdg 20:12} 以色列众支派打发人去，问便雅悯支派的各家说：“你们中间怎么做了这样的恶事呢？
{Jdg 20:13} Now therefore give up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and purge evil from Israel." But the Benjaminites would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the people of Israel.
{Jdg 20:13} 现在你们要将基比亚的那些匪徒交出来，我们好治死他们，从以色列中除掉这恶。”便雅悯人却不肯听从他们弟兄以色列人的话。
{Jdg 20:14} Then the people of Benjamin came together out of the cities to Gibeah to go out to battle against the people of Israel.
{Jdg 20:14} 便雅悯人从他们的各城里出来，聚集到了基比亚，要与以色列人打仗。
{Jdg 20:15} And the people of Benjamin mustered out of their cities on that day 26,000 men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who mustered 700 chosen men.
{Jdg 20:15} 那时便雅悯人从各城里点出拿刀的，共有二万六千；另外还有基比亚人点出七百精兵。
{Jdg 20:16} Among all these were 700 chosen men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
{Jdg 20:16} 在众军之中有拣选的七百精兵，都是左手便利的，能用机弦甩石打人，毫发不差。
{Jdg 20:17} And the men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered 400,000 men who drew the sword; all these were men of war.
{Jdg 20:17} 便雅悯人之外，点出以色列人拿刀的，共有四十万，都是战士。
{Jdg 20:18} The people of Israel arose and went up to Bethel and inquired of God, "Who shall go up first for us to fight against the people of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Judah shall go up first."
{Jdg 20:18} 以色列人就起来，到伯特利去求问} 神说：“我们中间谁当首先上去与便雅悯人争战呢？”耶和华说：“犹大当先上去。”
{Jdg 20:19} Then the people of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.
{Jdg 20:19} 以色列人早晨起来，对着基比亚安营。
{Jdg 20:20} And the men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin, and the men of Israel drew up the battle line against them at Gibeah.
{Jdg 20:20} 以色列人出来，要与便雅悯人打仗，就在基比亚前摆阵。
{Jdg 20:21} The people of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and destroyed on that day 22,000 men of the Israelites.
{Jdg 20:21} 便雅悯人就从基比亚出来，当日杀死以色列人二万二千。
{Jdg 20:22} But the people, the men of Israel, took courage, and again formed the battle line in the same place where they had formed it on the first day.
{Jdg 20:22} 以色列人彼此奋勇，仍在头一日摆阵的地方又摆阵。
{Jdg 20:23} And the people of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until the evening. And they inquired of the LORD, "Shall we again draw near to fight against our brothers, the people of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Go up against them."
{Jdg 20:23} 未摆阵之先，以色列人上去，在耶和华面前哭号，直到晚上，求问耶和华说：“我们再去与我们弟兄便雅悯人打仗可以不可以？”耶和华说：“可以上去攻击他们。”
{Jdg 20:24} So the people of Israel came near against the people of Benjamin the second day.
{Jdg 20:24} 第二日，以色列人就上前攻击便雅悯人。
{Jdg 20:25} And Benjamin went against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed 18,000 men of the people of Israel. All these were men who drew the sword.
{Jdg 20:25} 便雅悯人也在这日从基比亚出来，与以色列人接战，又杀死他们一万八千，都是拿刀的。
{Jdg 20:26} Then all the people of Israel, the whole army, went up and came to Bethel and wept. They sat there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
{Jdg 20:26} 以色列众人就上到伯特利，坐在耶和华面前哭号，当日禁食直到晚上；又在耶和华面前献燔祭和平安祭。
{Jdg 20:27} And the people of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
{Jdg 20:27} (SEE 20:28)
{Jdg 20:28} and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, ministered before it in those days), saying, "Shall we go out once more to battle against our brothers, the people of Benjamin, or shall we cease?" And the LORD said, "Go up, for tomorrow I will give them into your hand."
{Jdg 20:28} 那时，神的约柜在那里；亚伦的孙子、以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈侍立在约柜前。以色列人问耶和华说：“我们当再出去与我们弟兄便雅悯人打仗呢？还是罢兵呢？”耶和华说：“你们当上去，因为明日我必将他们交在你们手中。”
{Jdg 20:29} So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah.
{Jdg 20:29} 以色列人在基比亚的四围设下伏兵。
{Jdg 20:30} And the people of Israel went up against the people of Benjamin on the third day and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
{Jdg 20:30} 第三日，以色列人又上去攻击便雅悯人，在基比亚前摆阵，与前两次一样。
{Jdg 20:31} And the people of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city. And as at other times they began to strike and kill some of the people in the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the open country, about thirty men of Israel.
{Jdg 20:31} 便雅悯人也出来迎敌，就被引诱离城；在田间两条路上，一通伯特利，一通基比亚，像前两次，动手杀死以色列人约有三十个。
{Jdg 20:32} And the people of Benjamin said, "They are routed before us, as at the first." But the people of Israel said, "Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways."
{Jdg 20:32} 便雅悯人说：“他们仍旧败在我们面前。”但以色列人说：“我们不如逃跑，引诱他们离开城到路上来。”
{Jdg 20:33} And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar, and the men of Israel who were in ambush rushed out of their place from Maareh-geba.
{Jdg 20:33} 以色列众人都起来，在巴力他玛摆阵，以色列的伏兵从马利迦巴埋伏的地方冲上前去。
{Jdg 20:34} And there came against Gibeah 10,000 chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was hard, but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was close upon them.
{Jdg 20:34} 有以色列人中的一万精兵，来到基比亚前接战，势派甚是凶猛；便雅悯人却不知道灾祸临近了。
{Jdg 20:35} And the LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and the people of Israel destroyed 25,100 men of Benjamin that day. All these were men who drew the sword.
{Jdg 20:35} 耶和华使以色列人杀败便雅悯人。那日，以色列人杀死便雅悯人二万五千一百，都是拿刀的。
{Jdg 20:36} So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. The men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah.
{Jdg 20:36} 于是便雅悯人知道自己败了。先是以色列人；因为靠着在基比亚前所设的伏兵，就在便雅悯人面前诈败。
{Jdg 20:37} Then the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush moved out and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.
{Jdg 20:37} 伏兵急忙闯进基比亚，用刀杀死全城的人。
{Jdg 20:38} Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in the main ambush was that when they made a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city
{Jdg 20:38} 以色列人预先同伏兵约定在城内放火，以烟气上腾为号。
{Jdg 20:39} the men of Israel should turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel. They said, "Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle."
{Jdg 20:39} 以色列人临退阵的时候，便雅悯人动手杀死以色列人，约有三十个，就说：“他们仍像前次被我们杀败了。”
{Jdg 20:40} But when the signal began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven.
{Jdg 20:40} 当烟气如柱从城中上腾的时候，便雅悯人回头观看，见全城的烟气冲天。
{Jdg 20:41} Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that disaster was close upon them.
{Jdg 20:41} 以色列人又转身回来，便雅悯人就甚惊惶，因为看见灾祸临到自己了。
{Jdg 20:42} Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them. And those who came out of the cities were destroying them in their midst.
{Jdg 20:42} 他们在以色列人面前转身往旷野逃跑；以色列人在后面追杀。那从各城里出来的，也都夹攻杀灭他们。
{Jdg 20:43} Surrounding the Benjaminites, they pursued them and trod them down from Nohah as far as opposite Gibeah on the east.
{Jdg 20:43} 以色列人围绕便雅悯人，追赶他们，在他们歇脚之处、对着日出之地的基比亚践踏他们。
{Jdg 20:44} Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell, all of them men of valor.
{Jdg 20:44} 便雅悯人死了的有一万八千，都是勇士。
{Jdg 20:45} And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. Five thousand men of them were cut down in the highways. And they were pursued hard to Gidom, and 2,000 men of them were struck down.
{Jdg 20:45} 其余的人转身向旷野逃跑，往临门磐去。以色列人在道路上杀了他们五千人，如拾取遗穗一样，追到基顿又杀了他们二千人。
{Jdg 20:46} So all who fell that day of Benjamin were 25,000 men who drew the sword, all of them men of valor.
{Jdg 20:46} 那日便雅悯死了的共有二万五千人，都是拿刀的勇士。
{Jdg 20:47} But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and remained at the rock of Rimmon four months.
{Jdg 20:47} 只剩下六百人，转身向旷野逃跑，到了临门磐，就在那里住了四个月。
{Jdg 20:48} And the men of Israel turned back against the people of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, the city, men and beasts and all that they found. And all the towns that they found they set on fire.
{Jdg 20:48} 以色列人又转到便雅悯地，将各城的人和牲畜，并一切所遇见的，都用刀杀尽，又放火烧了一切城邑。
{Jdg 21:1}  Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, "No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin."
{Jdg 21:1}  以色列人在米斯巴曾起誓说：“我们都不将女儿给便雅悯人为妻。”
{Jdg 21:2}  And the people came to Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.
{Jdg 21:2}  以色列人来到伯特利，坐在神面前直到晚上，放声痛哭，
{Jdg 21:3}  And they said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel?"
{Jdg 21:3}  说：“耶和华以色列的神啊，为何以色列中有这样缺了一支派的事呢？”
{Jdg 21:4}  And the next day the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
{Jdg 21:4}  次日清早，百姓起来，在那里筑了一座坛，献燔祭和平安祭。
{Jdg 21:5}  And the people of Israel said, "Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?" For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD to Mizpah, saying, "He shall surely be put to death."
{Jdg 21:5}  以色列人彼此问说：“以色列各支派中，谁没有同会众上到耶和华面前来呢？”先是以色列人起过大誓说，凡不上米斯巴到耶和华面前来的，必将他治死。
{Jdg 21:6}  And the people of Israel had compassion for Benjamin their brother and said, "One tribe is cut off from Israel this day.
{Jdg 21:6}  以色列人为他们的弟兄便雅悯后悔，说：“如今以色列中绝了一个支派了。
{Jdg 21:7}  What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them any of our daughters for wives?"
{Jdg 21:7}  我们既在耶和华面前起誓说，必不将我们的女儿给便雅悯人为妻，现在我们当怎样办理、使他们剩下的人有妻呢？”
{Jdg 21:8}  And they said, "What one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to the LORD to Mizpah?" And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead, to the assembly.
{Jdg 21:8}  又彼此问说：“以色列支派中谁没有上米斯巴到耶和华面前来呢？”他们就查出基列雅比没有一人进营到会众那里；
{Jdg 21:9}  For when the people were mustered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there.
{Jdg 21:9}  因为百姓被数的时候，没有一个基列雅比人在那里。
{Jdg 21:10} So the congregation sent 12,000 of their bravest men there and commanded them, "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword; also the women and the little ones.
{Jdg 21:10} 会众就打发一万二千大勇士，吩咐他们说：“你们去用刀将基列雅比人连妇女带孩子都击杀了。
{Jdg 21:11} This is what you shall do: every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall devote to destruction."
{Jdg 21:11} 所当行的就是这样：要将一切男子和已嫁的女子尽行杀戮。”
{Jdg 21:12} And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
{Jdg 21:12} 他们在基列雅比人中，遇见了四百个未嫁的处女，就带到迦南地的示罗营里。
{Jdg 21:13} Then the whole congregation sent word to the people of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon and proclaimed peace to them.
{Jdg 21:13} 全会众打发人到临门磐的便雅悯人那里，向他们说和睦的话。
{Jdg 21:14} And Benjamin returned at that time. And they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead, but they were not enough for them.
{Jdg 21:14} 当时便雅悯人回来了，以色列人就把所存活基列雅比的女子给他们为妻，还是不够。
{Jdg 21:15} And the people had compassion on Benjamin because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
{Jdg 21:15} 百姓为便雅悯人后悔，因为耶和华使以色列人缺了一个支派（原文作使以色列中有了破口）。
{Jdg 21:16} Then the elders of the congregation said, "What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
{Jdg 21:16} 会中的长老说：“便雅悯中的女子既然除灭了，我们当怎样办理、使那余剩的人有妻呢？”
{Jdg 21:17} And they said, "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.
{Jdg 21:17} 又说：“便雅悯逃脱的人当有地业，免得以色列中涂抹了一个支派。
{Jdg 21:18} Yet we cannot give them wives from our daughters." For the people of Israel had sworn, "Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin."
{Jdg 21:18} 只是我们不能将自己的女儿给他们为妻；因为以色列人曾起誓说，有将女儿给便雅悯人为妻的，必受咒诅。”
{Jdg 21:19} So they said, "Behold, there is the yearly feast of the LORD at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah."
{Jdg 21:19} 他们又说：“在利波拿以南，伯特利以北，在示剑大路以东的示罗，年年有耶和华的节期”；
{Jdg 21:20} And they commanded the people of Benjamin, saying, "Go and lie in ambush in the vineyards
{Jdg 21:20} 就吩咐便雅悯人说：“你们去，在葡萄园中埋伏。
{Jdg 21:21} and watch. If the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards and snatch each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
{Jdg 21:21} 若看见示罗的女子出来跳舞，就从葡萄园出来，在示罗的女子中各抢一个为妻，回便雅悯地去。
{Jdg 21:22} And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, 'Grant them graciously to us, because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.'"
{Jdg 21:22} 他们的父亲或是弟兄若来与我们争竞，我们就说：‘求你们看我们的情面，施恩给这些人，因我们在争战的时候没有给他们留下女子为妻。这也不是你们将女子给他们的；若是你们给的，就算有罪。’”
{Jdg 21:23} And the people of Benjamin did so and took their wives, according to their number, from the dancers whom they carried off. Then they went and returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and lived in them.
{Jdg 21:23} 于是便雅悯人照样而行，按着他们的数目从跳舞的女子中抢去为妻，就回自己的地业去，又重修城邑居住。
{Jdg 21:24} And the people of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
{Jdg 21:24} 当时以色列人离开那里，各归本支派、本宗族、本地业去了。
{Jdg 21:25} In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
{Jdg 21:25} 那时，以色列中没有王，各人任意而行。
