{Exo 1:1}   These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:
{Exo 1:1}   以色列的众子，各带家眷，和雅各一同来到埃及。他们的名字记在下面。
{Exo 1:2}   Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
{Exo 1:2}   有流便、西缅、利未、犹大、
{Exo 1:3}   Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
{Exo 1:3}   以萨迦、西布伦、便雅悯、
{Exo 1:4}   Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
{Exo 1:4}   但、拿弗他利、迦得、亚设。
{Exo 1:5}   All the descendants of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.
{Exo 1:5}   凡从雅各而生的，共有七十人。约瑟已经在埃及。
{Exo 1:6}   Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.
{Exo 1:6}   约瑟和他的弟兄，并那一代的人，都死了。
{Exo 1:7}   But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.
{Exo 1:7}   以色列人生养众多，并且繁茂，极其强盛，满了那地。
{Exo 1:8}   Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
{Exo 1:8}   有不认识约瑟的新王起来，治理埃及，
{Exo 1:9}   And he said to his people, "Behold, the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us.
{Exo 1:9}   对他的百姓说：“看哪，这以色列民比我们还多，又比我们强盛。
{Exo 1:10}  Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land."
{Exo 1:10}  来吧，我们不如用巧计待他们，恐怕他们多起来，日后若遇什么争战的事，就连合我们的仇敌攻击我们，离开这地去了。”
{Exo 1:11}  Therefore they set taskmasters [任务主人] over them to afflict them with heavy burdens. They built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses.
{Exo 1:11}  于是埃及人派督工的辖制他们，加重担苦害他们。他们为法老建造两座积货城，就是比东和兰塞。
{Exo 1:12}  But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel.
{Exo 1:12}  只是越发苦害他们，他们越发多起来，越发蔓延；埃及人就因以色列人愁烦。
{Exo 1:13}  So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves
{Exo 1:13}  埃及人严严地使以色列人做工，
{Exo 1:14}  and made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field. In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves.
{Exo 1:14}  使他们因做苦工觉得命苦；无论是和泥，是做砖，是做田间各样的工，在一切的工上都严严地待他们。
{Exo 1:15}  Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,
{Exo 1:15}  有希伯来的两个收生婆，一名施弗拉，一名普阿；埃及王对他们说：
{Exo 1:16}  "When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live."
{Exo 1:16}  “你们为希伯来妇人收生，看他们临盆的时候，若是男孩，就把他杀了；若是女孩，就留他存活。”
{Exo 1:17}  But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live.
{Exo 1:17}  但是收生婆敬畏神，不照埃及王的吩咐行，竟存留男孩的性命。
{Exo 1:18}  So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this, and let the male children live?"
{Exo 1:18}  埃及王召了收生婆来，说：“你们为什么做这事，存留男孩的性命呢？”
{Exo 1:19}  The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them."
{Exo 1:19}  收生婆对法老说：“因为希伯来妇人与埃及妇人不同；希伯来妇人本是健壮的（原文作活泼的），收生婆还没有到，他们已经生产了。”
{Exo 1:20}  So God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong.
{Exo 1:20}  神厚待收生婆。以色列人多起来，极其强盛。
{Exo 1:21}  And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.
{Exo 1:21}  收生婆因为敬畏神，神便叫他们成立家室。
{Exo 1:22}  Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, "Every son that is born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live."
{Exo 1:22}  法老吩咐他的众民说：“以色列人所生的男孩，你们都要丢在河里；一切的女孩，你们要存留他的性命。”
{Exo 2:1}   Now a man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite woman.
{Exo 2:1}   有一个利未家的人娶了一个利未女子为妻。
{Exo 2:2}   The woman conceived and bore a son, and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.
{Exo 2:2}   那女人怀孕，生一个儿子，见他俊美，就藏了他三个月，
{Exo 2:3}   When she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank.
{Exo 2:3}   后来不能再藏，就取了一个蒲草箱，抹上石漆和石油，将孩子放在里头，把箱子搁在河边的芦荻中。
{Exo 2:4}   And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.
{Exo 2:4}   孩子的姊姊远远站着，要知道他究竟怎么样。
{Exo 2:5}   Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it.
{Exo 2:5}   法老的女儿来到河边洗澡，他的使女们在河边行走。他看见箱子在芦荻中，就打发一个婢女拿来。
{Exo 2:6}   When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."
{Exo 2:6}   他打开箱子，看见那孩子。孩子哭了，他就可怜他，说：“这是希伯来人的一个孩子。”
{Exo 2:7}   Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?"
{Exo 2:7}   孩子的姊姊对法老的女儿说：“我去在希伯来妇人中叫一个奶妈来，为你奶这孩子，可以不可以？”
{Exo 2:8}   And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go." So the girl went and called the child's mother.
{Exo 2:8}   法老的女儿说：“可以。”童女就去叫了孩子的母亲来。
{Exo 2:9}   And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.
{Exo 2:9}   法老的女儿对他说：“你把这孩子抱去，为我奶他，我必给你工价。”妇人就抱了孩子去奶他。
{Exo 2:10}  When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, "Because," she said, "I drew him out of the water."
{Exo 2:10}  孩子渐长，妇人把他带到法老的女儿那里，就作了他的儿子。他给孩子起名叫摩西，意思说：“因我把他从水里拉出来。”
{Exo 2:11}  One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.
{Exo 2:11}  后来，摩西长大，他出去到他弟兄那里，看他们的重担，见一个埃及人打希伯来人的一个弟兄。
{Exo 2:12}  He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
{Exo 2:12}  他左右观看，见没有人，就把埃及人打死了，藏在沙土里。
{Exo 2:13}  When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, "Why do you strike your companion?"
{Exo 2:13}  第二天他出去，见有两个希伯来人争斗，就对那欺负人的说：“你为什么打你同族的人呢？”
{Exo 2:14}  He answered, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid, and thought, "Surely the thing is known."
{Exo 2:14}  那人说：“谁立你作我们的首领和审判官呢？难道你要杀我，像杀那埃及人吗？”摩西便惧怕，说：“这事必是被人知道了。”
{Exo 2:15}  When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by a well.
{Exo 2:15}  法老听见这事，就想杀摩西，但摩西躲避法老，逃往米甸地居住。
{Exo 2:16}  Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
{Exo 2:16}  一日，他在井旁坐下。米甸的祭司有七个女儿；他们来打水，打满了槽，要饮父亲的群羊。
{Exo 2:17}  The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and watered their flock.
{Exo 2:17}  有牧羊的人来，把他们赶走了，摩西却起来帮助他们，又饮了他们的群羊。
{Exo 2:18}  When they came home to their father Reuel, he said, "How is it that you have come home so soon today?"
{Exo 2:18}  他们来到父亲流珥那里；他说：“今日你们为何来得这么快呢？”
{Exo 2:19}  They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock."
{Exo 2:19}  他们说：“有一个埃及人救我们脱离牧羊人的手，并且为我们打水饮了群羊。”
{Exo 2:20}  He said to his daughters, "Then where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."
{Exo 2:20}  他对女儿们说：“那个人在那里？你们为什么撇下他呢？你们去请他来吃饭。”
{Exo 2:21}  And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah.
{Exo 2:21}  摩西甘心和那人同住；那人把他的女儿西坡拉给摩西为妻。
{Exo 2:22}  She gave birth to a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
{Exo 2:22}  西坡拉生了一个儿子，摩西给他起名叫革舜，意思说：“因我在外邦作了寄居的。”
{Exo 2:23}  During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God.
{Exo 2:23}  过了多年，埃及王死了。以色列人因做苦工，就叹息哀求，他们的哀声达于神。
{Exo 2:24}  And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
{Exo 2:24}  神听见他们的哀声，就记念他与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所立的约。
{Exo 2:25}  God saw the people of Israel--and God knew.
{Exo 2:25}  神看顾以色列人，也知道他们的苦情。
{Exo 3:1}   Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
{Exo 3:1}   摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群；一日领羊群往野外去，到了神的山，就是何烈山。
{Exo 3:2}   And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed.
{Exo 3:2}   耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。摩西观看，不料，荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。
{Exo 3:3}   And Moses said, "I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the bush is not burned."
{Exo 3:3}   摩西说：“我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢？”
{Exo 3:4}   When the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, "Moses, Moses!" And he said, "Here I am."
{Exo 3:4}   耶和华神见他过去要看，就从荆棘里呼叫说：“摩西！摩西！”他说：“我在这里。”
{Exo 3:5}   Then he said, "Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground."
{Exo 3:5}   神说：“不要近前来。当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地”；
{Exo 3:6}   And he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
{Exo 3:6}   又说：“我是你父亲的神，是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。”摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看神。
{Exo 3:7}   Then the LORD said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings,
{Exo 3:7}   耶和华说：“我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了；他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声，我也听见了。我原知道他们的痛苦，
{Exo 3:8}   and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
{Exo 3:8}   我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们出了那地，到美好、宽阔、流奶与蜜之地，就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。
{Exo 3:9}   And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
{Exo 3:9}   现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中，我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。
{Exo 3:10}  Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt."
{Exo 3:10}  故此，我要打发你去见法老，使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。”
{Exo 3:11}  But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
{Exo 3:11}  摩西对神说：“我是什么人，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？”
{Exo 3:12}  He said, "But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
{Exo 3:12}  神说：“我必与你同在。你将百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们必在这山上事奉我；这就是我打发你去的证据。”
{Exo 3:13}  Then Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"
{Exo 3:13}  摩西对神说：“我到以色列人那里，对他们说：‘你们祖宗的神打发我到你们这里来。’他们若问我说：‘他叫什么名字？’我要对他们说什么呢？”
{Exo 3:14}  God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
{Exo 3:14}  神对摩西说：“我是自有永有的”；又说：“你要对以色列人这样说：‘那自有的打发我到你们这里来。’”
{Exo 3:15}  God also said to Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.
{Exo 3:15}  神又对摩西说：“你要对以色列人这样说：‘耶和华你们祖宗的神，就是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神，打发我到你们这里来。’耶和华是我的名，直到永远；这也是我的纪念，直到万代。
{Exo 3:16}  Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, "I have observed you and what has been done to you in Egypt,
{Exo 3:16}  你去招聚以色列的长老，对他们说：‘耶和华你们祖宗的神，就是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神，向我显现，说：我实在眷顾了你们，我也看见埃及人怎样待你们。
{Exo 3:17}  and I promise that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey."'
{Exo 3:17}  我也说：要将你们从埃及的困苦中领出来，往迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的地去，就是到流奶与蜜之地。’
{Exo 3:18}  And they will listen to your voice, and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now, please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.'
{Exo 3:18}  他们必听你的话。你和以色列的长老要去见埃及王，对他说：‘耶和华希伯来人的神遇见了我们，现在求你容我们往旷野去，走三天的路程，为要祭祀耶和华我们的神。’
{Exo 3:19}  But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.
{Exo 3:19}  我知道虽用大能的手，埃及王也不容你们去。
{Exo 3:20}  So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the wonders that I will do in it; after that he will let you go.
{Exo 3:20}  我必伸手在埃及中间施行我一切的奇事，攻击那地，然后他才容你们去。
{Exo 3:21}  And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and when you go, you shall not go empty,
{Exo 3:21}  我必叫你们在埃及人眼前蒙恩，你们去的时候就不至于空手而去。
{Exo 3:22}  but each woman shall ask of her neighbor, and any woman who lives in her house, for silver and gold jewelry, and for clothing. You shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians."
{Exo 3:22}  但各妇女必向他的邻舍，并居住在他家里的女人，要金器银器和衣裳，好给你们的儿女穿戴。这样你们就把埃及人的财物夺去了。”
{Exo 4:1}   Then Moses answered, "But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, 'The LORD did not appear to you.'"
{Exo 4:1}   摩西回答说：“他们必不信我，也不听我的话，必说：‘耶和华并没有向你显现。’”
{Exo 4:2}   The LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" He said, "A staff."
{Exo 4:2}   耶和华对摩西说：“你手里是什么？”他说：“是杖。”
{Exo 4:3}   And he said, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses ran from it.
{Exo 4:3}   耶和华说：“丢在地上。”他一丢下去，就变作蛇；摩西便跑开。
{Exo 4:4}   But the LORD said to Moses, "Put out your hand and catch it by the tail"--so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand--
{Exo 4:4}   耶和华对摩西说：“伸出手来，拿住他的尾巴，他必在你手中仍变为杖；
{Exo 4:5}   "that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."
{Exo 4:5}   如此好叫他们信耶和华他们祖宗的神，就是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神，是向你显现了。”
{Exo 4:6}   Again, the LORD said to him, "Put your hand inside your cloak." And he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow.
{Exo 4:6}   耶和华又对他说：“把手放在怀里。”他就把手放在怀里，及至抽出来，不料，手长了大麻疯，有雪那样白。
{Exo 4:7}   Then God said, "Put your hand back inside your cloak." So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.
{Exo 4:7}   耶和华说：“再把手放在怀里。”他就再把手放在怀里，及至从怀里抽出来，不料，手已经复原，与周身的肉一样；
{Exo 4:8}   "If they will not believe you," God said, "or listen to the first sign, they may believe the latter sign.
{Exo 4:8}   又说：“倘或他们不听你的话，也不信头一个神迹，他们必信第二个神迹。
{Exo 4:9}   If they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground, and the water that you shall take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground."
{Exo 4:9}   这两个神迹若都不信，也不听你的话，你就从河里取些水，倒在旱地上，你从河里取的水必在旱地上变作血。”
{Exo 4:10}  But Moses said to the LORD, "Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue."
{Exo 4:10}  摩西对耶和华说：“主啊，我素日不是能言的人，就是从你对仆人说话以后，也是这样。我本是拙口笨舌的。”
{Exo 4:11}  Then the LORD said to him, "Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
{Exo 4:11}  耶和华对他说：“谁造人的口呢？谁使人口哑、耳聋、目明、眼瞎呢？岂不是我耶和华吗？
{Exo 4:12}  Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak."
{Exo 4:12}  现在去吧，我必赐你口才，指教你所当说的话。”
{Exo 4:13}  But he said, "Oh, my Lord, please send someone else."
{Exo 4:13}  摩西说：“主啊，你愿意打发谁，就打发谁去吧！”
{Exo 4:14}  Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said, "Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
{Exo 4:14}  耶和华向摩西发怒说：“不是有你的哥哥利未人亚伦吗？我知道他是能言的；现在他出来迎接你，他一见你，心里就欢喜。
{Exo 4:15}  You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do.
{Exo 4:15}  你要将当说的话传给他；我也要赐你和他口才，又要指教你们所当行的事。
{Exo 4:16}  He shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as God to him.
{Exo 4:16}  他要替你对百姓说话；你要以他当作口，他要以你当作神。
{Exo 4:17}  And take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs."
{Exo 4:17}  你手里要拿这杖，好行神迹。”
{Exo 4:18}  Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
{Exo 4:18}  于是，摩西回到他岳父叶忒罗那里，对他说：“求你容我回去见我在埃及的弟兄，看他们还在不在。”叶忒罗对摩西说：“你可以平平安安的去吧！”
{Exo 4:19}  And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead."
{Exo 4:19}  耶和华在米甸对摩西说：“你要回埃及去，因为寻索你命的人都死了。”
{Exo 4:20}  So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.
{Exo 4:20}  摩西就带着妻子和两个儿子，叫他们骑上驴，回埃及地去。摩西手里拿着神的杖。
{Exo 4:21}  And the LORD said to Moses, "When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put in your power. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.
{Exo 4:21}  耶和华对摩西说：“你回到埃及的时候，要留意将我指示你的一切奇事行在法老面前。但我要使（或作：任凭；下同）他的心刚硬，他必不容百姓去。
{Exo 4:22}  Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD, Israel is my firstborn son,
{Exo 4:22}  你要对法老说：‘耶和华这样说：以色列是我的儿子，我的长子。
{Exo 4:23}  and I say to you, "Let my son go that he may serve me." If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.'"
{Exo 4:23}  我对你说过：容我的儿子去，好事奉我。你还是不肯容他去。看哪，我要杀你的长子。’”
{Exo 4:24}  At a lodging place on the way the LORD met him and sought to put him to death.
{Exo 4:24}  摩西在路上住宿的地方，耶和华遇见他，想要杀他。
{Exo 4:25}  Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses' feet with it and said, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!"
{Exo 4:25}  西坡拉就拿一块火石，割下他儿子的阳皮，丢在摩西脚前，说：“你真是我的血郎了。”
{Exo 4:26}  So he let him alone. It was then that she said, "A bridegroom of blood," because of the circumcision.
{Exo 4:26}  这样，耶和华才放了他。西坡拉说：“你因割礼就是血郎了。”
{Exo 4:27}  The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
{Exo 4:27}  耶和华对亚伦说：“你往旷野去迎接摩西。”他就去，在神的山遇见摩西，和他亲嘴。
{Exo 4:28}  And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him to speak, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do.
{Exo 4:28}  摩西将耶和华打发他所说的言语和嘱咐他所行的神迹都告诉了亚伦。
{Exo 4:29}  Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel.
{Exo 4:29}  摩西、亚伦就去招聚以色列的众长老。
{Exo 4:30}  Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people.
{Exo 4:30}  亚伦将耶和华对摩西所说的一切话述说了一遍，又在百姓眼前行了那些神迹，
{Exo 4:31}  And the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped.
{Exo 4:31}  百姓就信了。以色列人听见耶和华眷顾他们，鉴察他们的困苦，就低头下拜。
{Exo 5:1}   Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'"
{Exo 5:1}   后来摩西、亚伦去对法老说：“耶和华以色列的神这样说：‘容我的百姓去，在旷野向我守节。’”
{Exo 5:2}   But Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and moreover, I will not let Israel go."
{Exo 5:2}   法老说：“耶和华是谁，使我听他的话，容以色列人去呢？我不认识耶和华，也不容以色列人去！”
{Exo 5:3}   Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword."
{Exo 5:3}   他们说：“希伯来人的神遇见了我们。求你容我们往旷野去，走三天的路程，祭祀耶和华我们的神，免得他用瘟疫、刀兵攻击我们。”
{Exo 5:4}   But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens."
{Exo 5:4}   埃及王对他们说：“摩西、亚伦！你们为什么叫百姓旷工呢？你们去担你们的担子吧！”
{Exo 5:5}   And Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens!"
{Exo 5:5}   又说：“看哪，这地的以色列人如今众多，你们竟叫他们歇下担子！”
{Exo 5:6}   The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen,
{Exo 5:6}   当天，法老吩咐督工的和官长说：
{Exo 5:7}   "You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
{Exo 5:7}   “你们不可照常把草给百姓做砖，叫他们自己去捡草。
{Exo 5:8}   But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, 'Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.'
{Exo 5:8}   他们素常做砖的数目，你们仍旧向他们要，一点不可减少；因为他们是懒惰的，所以呼求说：‘容我们去祭祀我们的神。’
{Exo 5:9}   Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words."
{Exo 5:9}   你们要把更重的工夫加在这些人身上，叫他们劳碌，不听虚谎的言语。”
{Exo 5:10}  So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I will not give you straw.
{Exo 5:10}  督工的和官长出来对百姓说：“法老这样说：‘我不给你们草。
{Exo 5:11}  Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.'"
{Exo 5:11}  你们自己在那里能找草，就往那里去找吧！但你们的工一点不可减少。’”
{Exo 5:12}  So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
{Exo 5:12}  于是百姓散在埃及遍地，捡碎秸当作草。
{Exo 5:13}  The taskmasters were urgent, saying, "Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw."
{Exo 5:13}  督工的催着说：“你们一天当完一天的工，与先前有草一样。”
{Exo 5:14}  And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, "Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?"
{Exo 5:14}  法老督工的，责打他所派以色列人的官长，说：“你们昨天今天为什么没有照向来的数目做砖、完你们的工作呢？”
{Exo 5:15}  Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, "Why do you treat your servants like this?
{Exo 5:15}  以色列人的官长就来哀求法老说：“为什么这样待你的仆人？
{Exo 5:16}  No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."
{Exo 5:16}  督工的不把草给仆人，并且对我们说：‘做砖吧！’看哪，你仆人挨了打，其实是你百姓的错。”
{Exo 5:17}  But he said, "You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'
{Exo 5:17}  但法老说：“你们是懒惰的！你们是懒惰的！所以说：‘容我们去祭祀耶和华。’
{Exo 5:18}  Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks."
{Exo 5:18}  现在你们去做工吧！草是不给你们的，砖却要如数交纳。”
{Exo 5:19}  The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, "You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day."
{Exo 5:19}  以色列人的官长听说“你们每天做砖的工作一点不可减少”，就知道是遭遇祸患了。
{Exo 5:20}  They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh;
{Exo 5:20}  他们离了法老出来，正遇见摩西、亚伦站在对面，
{Exo 5:21}  and they said to them, "The LORD look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."
{Exo 5:21}  就向他们说：“愿耶和华鉴察你们，施行判断；因你们使我们在法老和他臣仆面前有了臭名，把刀递在他们手中杀我们。”
{Exo 5:22}  Then Moses turned to the LORD and said, "O Lord, why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me?
{Exo 5:22}  摩西回到耶和华那里，说：“主啊，你为什么苦待这百姓呢？为什么打发我去呢？
{Exo 5:23}  For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have not delivered your people at all."
{Exo 5:23}  自从我去见法老，奉你的名说话，他就苦待这百姓，你一点也没有拯救他们。”
{Exo 6:1}   But the LORD said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land."
{Exo 6:1}   耶和华对摩西说：“现在你必看见我向法老所行的事，使他因我大能的手容以色列人去，且把他们赶出他的地。”
{Exo 6:2}   God spoke to Moses and said to him, "I am the LORD.
{Exo 6:2}   神晓谕摩西说：“我是耶和华。
{Exo 6:3}   I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them.
{Exo 6:3}   我从前向亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各显现为全能的神；至于我名耶和华，他们未曾知道。
{Exo 6:4}   I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners.
{Exo 6:4}   我与他们坚定所立的约，要把他们寄居的迦南地赐给他们。
{Exo 6:5}   Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.
{Exo 6:5}   我也听见以色列人被埃及人苦待的哀声，我也记念我的约。
{Exo 6:6}   Say therefore to the people of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.
{Exo 6:6}   所以你要对以色列人说：‘我是耶和华；我要用伸出来的膀臂重重的刑罚埃及人，救赎你们脱离他们的重担，不做他们的苦工。
{Exo 6:7}   I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
{Exo 6:7}   我要以你们为我的百姓，我也要作你们的神。你们要知道我是耶和华你们的神，是救你们脱离埃及人之重担的。
{Exo 6:8}   I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it to you for a possession. I am the LORD.'"
{Exo 6:8}   我起誓应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的那地，我要把你们领进去，将那地赐给你们为业。我是耶和华。’”
{Exo 6:9}   Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery.
{Exo 6:9}   摩西将这话告诉以色列人，只是他们因苦工愁烦，不肯听他的话。
{Exo 6:10}  So the LORD said to Moses,
{Exo 6:10}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Exo 6:11}  "Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the people of Israel go out of his land."
{Exo 6:11}  “你进去对埃及王法老说，要容以色列人出他的地。”
{Exo 6:12}  But Moses said to the LORD, "Behold, the people of Israel have not listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, for I am of uncircumcised lips?"
{Exo 6:12}  摩西在耶和华面前说：“以色列人尚且不听我的话，法老怎肯听我这拙口笨舌的人呢？”
{Exo 6:13}  But the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge about the people of Israel and about Pharaoh king of Egypt: to bring the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
{Exo 6:13}  耶和华吩咐摩西、亚伦往以色列人和埃及王法老那里去，把以色列人从埃及地领出来。

{Exo 6:26}  These are the Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said: "Bring out the people of Israel from the land of Egypt by their hosts."
{Exo 6:26}  耶和华说：“将以色列人按着他们的军队从埃及地领出来。”这是对那亚伦、摩西说的。
{Exo 6:27}  It was they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the people of Israel from Egypt, this Moses and this Aaron.
{Exo 6:27}  对埃及王法老说要将以色列人从埃及领出来的，就是这摩西、亚伦。
{Exo 6:28}  On the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
{Exo 6:28}  当耶和华在埃及地对摩西说话的日子，
{Exo 6:29}  the LORD said to Moses, "I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you."
{Exo 6:29}  他向摩西说：“我是耶和华；我对你说的一切话，你都要告诉埃及王法老。”
{Exo 6:30}  But Moses said to the LORD, "Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips. How will Pharaoh listen to me?"
{Exo 6:30}  摩西在耶和华面前说：“看哪，我是拙口笨舌的人，法老怎肯听我呢？”
{Exo 7:1}   And the LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.
{Exo 7:1}   耶和华对摩西说：“我使你在法老面前代替神，你的哥哥亚伦是替你说话的。
{Exo 7:2}   You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land.
{Exo 7:2}   凡我所吩咐你的，你都要说。你的哥哥亚伦要对法老说，容以色列人出他的地。
{Exo 7:3}   But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
{Exo 7:3}   我要使法老的心刚硬，也要在埃及地多行神迹奇事。
{Exo 7:4}   Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
{Exo 7:4}   但法老必不听你们；我要伸手重重的刑罚埃及，将我的军队以色列民从埃及地领出来。
{Exo 7:5}   The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them."
{Exo 7:5}   我伸手攻击埃及，将以色列人从他们中间领出来的时候，埃及人就要知道我是耶和华。”
{Exo 7:6}   Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the LORD commanded them.
{Exo 7:6}   摩西、亚伦这样行；耶和华怎样吩咐他们，他们就照样行了。
{Exo 7:7}   Now Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
{Exo 7:7}   摩西、亚伦与法老说话的时候，摩西八十岁，亚伦八十三岁。
{Exo 7:8}   Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
{Exo 7:8}   耶和华晓谕摩西、亚伦说：
{Exo 7:9}   "When Pharaoh says to you, 'Prove yourselves by working a miracle,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.'"
{Exo 7:9}   “法老若对你们说：‘你们行件奇事吧！’你就吩咐亚伦说：‘把杖丢在法老面前，使杖变作蛇。’”
{Exo 7:10}  So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.
{Exo 7:10}  摩西、亚伦进去见法老，就照耶和华所吩咐的行。亚伦把杖丢在法老和臣仆面前，杖就变作蛇。
{Exo 7:11}  Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and they, the magicians of Egypt, also did the same by their secret arts.
{Exo 7:11}  于是法老召了博士和术士来；他们是埃及行法术的，也用邪术照样而行。
{Exo 7:12}  For each man cast down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
{Exo 7:12}  他们各人丢下自己的杖，杖就变作蛇；但亚伦的杖吞了他们的杖。
{Exo 7:13}  Still Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
{Exo 7:13}  法老心里刚硬，不肯听从摩西、亚伦，正如耶和华所说的。
{Exo 7:14}  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go.
{Exo 7:14}  耶和华对摩西说：“法老心里固执，不肯容百姓去。
{Exo 7:15}  Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water. Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that turned into a serpent.
{Exo 7:15}  明日早晨，他出来往水边去，你要往河边迎接他，手里要拿着那变过蛇的杖，
{Exo 7:16}  And you shall say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness." But so far, you have not obeyed.
{Exo 7:16}  对他说：‘耶和华希伯来人的神打发我来见你，说：容我的百姓去，好在旷野事奉我。到如今你还是不听。
{Exo 7:17}  Thus says the LORD, "By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall turn into blood.
{Exo 7:17}  耶和华这样说：我要用我手里的杖击打河中的水，水就变作血；因此，你必知道我是耶和华。
{Exo 7:18}  The fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will grow weary of drinking water from the Nile."'"
{Exo 7:18}  河里的鱼必死，河也要腥臭，埃及人就要厌恶吃这河里的水。’”
{Exo 7:19}  And the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, their canals, and their ponds, and all their pools of water, so that they may become blood, and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"
{Exo 7:19}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：“你对亚伦说：‘把你的杖伸在埃及所有的水以上，就是在他们的江、河、池、塘以上，叫水都变作血。在埃及遍地，无论在木器中，石器中，都必有血。’”
{Exo 7:20}  Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile, and all the water in the Nile turned into blood.
{Exo 7:20}  摩西、亚伦就照耶和华所吩咐的行。亚伦在法老和臣仆眼前举杖击打河里的水，河里的水都变作血了。
{Exo 7:21}  And the fish in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
{Exo 7:21}  河里的鱼死了，河也腥臭了，埃及人就不能吃这河里的水；埃及遍地都有了血。
{Exo 7:22}  But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts. So Pharaoh's heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
{Exo 7:22}  埃及行法术的，也用邪术照样而行。法老心里刚硬，不肯听摩西、亚伦，正如耶和华所说的。
{Exo 7:23}  Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart.
{Exo 7:23}  法老转身进宫，也不把这事放在心上。
{Exo 7:24}  And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile.
{Exo 7:24}  埃及人都在河的两边挖地，要得水喝，因为他们不能喝这河里的水。
{Exo 7:25}  Seven full days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.
{Exo 7:25}  耶和华击打河以后满了七天。
{Exo 8:1}   Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
{Exo 8:1}   耶和华吩咐摩西说：“你进去见法老，对他说：‘耶和华这样说：容我的百姓去，好事奉我。
{Exo 8:2}   But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your country with frogs.
{Exo 8:2}   你若不肯容他们去，我必使青蛙糟蹋你的四境。
{Exo 8:3}   The Nile shall swarm with frogs that shall come up into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed and into the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls.
{Exo 8:3}   河里要滋生青蛙；这青蛙要上来进你的宫殿和你的卧房，上你的床榻，进你臣仆的房屋，上你百姓的身上，进你的炉灶和你的抟面盆，
{Exo 8:4}   The frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your servants."'"
{Exo 8:4}   又要上你和你百姓并你众臣仆的身上。’”
{Exo 8:5}   And the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt!'"
{Exo 8:5}   耶和华晓谕摩西说：“你对亚伦说：‘把你的杖伸在江、河、池以上，使青蛙到埃及地上来。’”
{Exo 8:6}   So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
{Exo 8:6}   亚伦便伸杖在埃及的诸水以上，青蛙就上来，遮满了埃及地。
{Exo 8:7}   But the magicians did the same by their secret arts and made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
{Exo 8:7}   行法术的也用他们的邪术照样而行，叫青蛙上了埃及地。
{Exo 8:8}   Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, "Plead with the LORD to take away the frogs from me and from my people, and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
{Exo 8:8}   法老召了摩西、亚伦来，说：“请你们求耶和华使这青蛙离开我和我的民，我就容百姓去祭祀耶和华。”
{Exo 8:9}   Moses said to Pharaoh, "Be pleased to command me when I am to plead for you and for your servants and for your people, that the frogs be cut off from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile."
{Exo 8:9}   摩西对法老说：“任凭你吧，我要何时为你和你的臣仆并你的百姓祈求，除灭青蛙离开你和你的宫殿只留在河里呢？”
{Exo 8:10}  And he said, "Tomorrow." Moses said, "Be it as you say, so that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.
{Exo 8:10}  他说：“明天。”摩西说：“可以照你的话吧，好叫你知道没有像耶和华我们神的。
{Exo 8:11}  The frogs shall go away from you and your houses and your servants and your people. They shall be left only in the Nile."
{Exo 8:11}  青蛙要离开你和你的宫殿，并你的臣仆与你的百姓，只留在河里。”
{Exo 8:12}  So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD about the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh.
{Exo 8:12}  于是摩西、亚伦离开法老出去。摩西为扰害法老的青蛙呼求耶和华。
{Exo 8:13}  And the LORD did according to the word of Moses. The frogs died out in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.
{Exo 8:13}  耶和华就照摩西的话行。凡在房里、院中、田间的青蛙都死了。
{Exo 8:14}  And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
{Exo 8:14}  众人把青蛙聚拢成堆，遍地就都腥臭。
{Exo 8:15}  But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
{Exo 8:15}  但法老见灾祸松缓，就硬着心，不肯听他们，正如耶和华所说的。
{Exo 8:16}  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats in all the land of Egypt.'"
{Exo 8:16}  耶和华吩咐摩西说：“你对亚伦说：‘伸出你的杖击打地上的尘土，使尘土在埃及遍地变作虱子（或作：虼蚤；下同）。’”
{Exo 8:17}  And they did so. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt.
{Exo 8:17}  他们就这样行。亚伦伸杖击打地上的尘土，就在人身上和牲畜身上有了虱子；埃及遍地的尘土都变成虱子了。
{Exo 8:18}  The magicians tried by their secret arts to produce gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast.
{Exo 8:18}  行法术的也用邪术要生出虱子来，却是不能。于是在人身上和牲畜身上都有了虱子。
{Exo 8:19}  Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
{Exo 8:19}  行法术的就对法老说：“这是神的手段。”法老心里刚硬，不肯听摩西、亚伦，正如耶和华所说的。
{Exo 8:20}  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
{Exo 8:20}  耶和华对摩西说：“你清早起来，法老来到水边，你站在他面前，对他说：‘耶和华这样说：容我的百姓去，好事奉我。
{Exo 8:21}  Or else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants and your people, and into your houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand.
{Exo 8:21}  你若不容我的百姓去，我要叫成群的苍蝇到你和你臣仆并你百姓的身上，进你的房屋，并且埃及人的房屋和他们所住的地都要满了成群的苍蝇。
{Exo 8:22}  But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people dwell, so that no swarms of flies shall be there, that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.
{Exo 8:22}  当那日，我必分别我百姓所住的歌珊地，使那里没有成群的苍蝇，好叫你知道我是天下的耶和华。
{Exo 8:23}  Thus I will put a division between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall happen."'"
{Exo 8:23}  我要将我的百姓和你的百姓分别出来。明天必有这神迹。’”
{Exo 8:24}  And the LORD did so. There came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants' houses. Throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by the swarms of flies.
{Exo 8:24}  耶和华就这样行。苍蝇成了大群，进入法老的宫殿，和他臣仆的房屋；埃及遍地就因这成群的苍蝇败坏了。
{Exo 8:25}  Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God within the land."
{Exo 8:25}  法老召了摩西、亚伦来，说：“你们去，在这地祭祀你们的神吧！”
{Exo 8:26}  But Moses said, "It would not be right to do so, for the offerings we shall sacrifice to the LORD our God are an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice offerings abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?
{Exo 8:26}  摩西说：“这样行本不相宜，因为我们要把埃及人所厌恶的祭祀耶和华我们的神；若把埃及人所厌恶的在他们眼前献为祭，他们岂不拿石头打死我们吗？
{Exo 8:27}  We must go three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he tells us."
{Exo 8:27}  我们要往旷野去，走三天的路程，照着耶和华我们神所要吩咐我们的祭祀他。”
{Exo 8:28}  So Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you must not go very far away. Plead for me."
{Exo 8:28}  法老说：“我容你们去，在旷野祭祀耶和华你们的神；只是不要走得很远。求你们为我祈祷。”
{Exo 8:29}  Then Moses said, "Behold, I am going out from you and I will plead with the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh cheat again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
{Exo 8:29}  摩西说：“我要出去求耶和华，使成群的苍蝇明天离开法老和法老的臣仆并法老的百姓；法老却不可再行诡诈，不容百姓去祭祀耶和华。”
{Exo 8:30}  So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
{Exo 8:30}  于是摩西离开法老去求耶和华。
{Exo 8:31}  And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained.
{Exo 8:31}  耶和华就照摩西的话行，叫成群的苍蝇离开法老和他的臣仆并他的百姓，一个也没有留下。
{Exo 8:32}  But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.
{Exo 8:32}  这一次法老又硬着心，不容百姓去。
{Exo 9:1}   Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
{Exo 9:1}   耶和华吩咐摩西说：“你进去见法老，对他说：‘耶和华希伯来人的神这样说：容我的百姓去，好事奉我。
{Exo 9:2}   For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them,
{Exo 9:2}   你若不肯容他们去，仍旧强留他们，
{Exo 9:3}   behold, the hand of the LORD will fall with a very severe plague upon your livestock that are in the field, the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks.
{Exo 9:3}   耶和华的手加在你田间的牲畜上，就是在马、驴、骆驼、牛群、羊群上，必有重重的瘟疫。
{Exo 9:4}   But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing of all that belongs to the people of Israel shall die."'"
{Exo 9:4}   耶和华要分别以色列的牲畜和埃及的牲畜，凡属以色列人的，一样都不死。’”
{Exo 9:5}   And the LORD set a time, saying, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land."
{Exo 9:5}   耶和华就定了时候，说：“明天耶和华必在此地行这事。”
{Exo 9:6}   And the next day the LORD did this thing. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one of the livestock of the people of Israel died.
{Exo 9:6}   第二天，耶和华就行这事。埃及的牲畜几乎都死了，只是以色列人的牲畜，一个都没有死。
{Exo 9:7}   And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the livestock of Israel was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
{Exo 9:7}   法老打发人去看，谁知以色列人的牲畜连一个都没有死。法老的心却是固执，不容百姓去。
{Exo 9:8}   And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw them in the air in the sight of Pharaoh.
{Exo 9:8}   耶和华吩咐摩西、亚伦说：“你们取几捧炉灰，摩西要在法老面前向天扬起来。
{Exo 9:9}   It shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt."
{Exo 9:9}   这灰要在埃及全地变作尘土，在人身上和牲畜身上成了起泡的疮。”
{Exo 9:10}  So they took soot from the kiln and stood before Pharaoh. And Moses threw it in the air, and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast.
{Exo 9:10}  摩西、亚伦取了炉灰，站在法老面前。摩西向天扬起来，就在人身上和牲畜身上成了起泡的疮。
{Exo 9:11}  And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils came upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.
{Exo 9:11}  行法术的在摩西面前站立不住，因为在他们身上和一切埃及人身上都有这疮。
{Exo 9:12}  But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had spoken to Moses.
{Exo 9:12}  耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不听他们，正如耶和华对摩西所说的。
{Exo 9:13}  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
{Exo 9:13}  耶和华对摩西说：“你清早起来，站在法老面前，对他说：‘耶和华希伯来人的神这样说：容我的百姓去，好事奉我。
{Exo 9:14}  For this time I will send all my plagues on you yourself, and on your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
{Exo 9:14}  因为这一次我要叫一切的灾殃临到你和你臣仆并你百姓的身上，叫你知道在普天下没有像我的。
{Exo 9:15}  For by now I could have put out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth.
{Exo 9:15}  我若伸手用瘟疫攻击你和你的百姓，你早就从地上除灭了。
{Exo 9:16}  But for this purpose I have raised you up, to show you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.
{Exo 9:16}  其实，我叫你存立，是特要向你显我的大能，并要使我的名传遍天下。
{Exo 9:17}  You are still exalting yourself against my people and will not let them go.
{Exo 9:17}  你还向我的百姓自高，不容他们去吗？
{Exo 9:18}  Behold, about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
{Exo 9:18}  到明天约在这时候，我必叫重大的冰雹降下，自从埃及开国以来，没有这样的冰雹。
{Exo 9:19}  Now therefore send, get your livestock and all that you have in the field into safe shelter, for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home will die when the hail falls on them."'"
{Exo 9:19}  现在你要打发人把你的牲畜和你田间一切所有的催进来；凡在田间不收回家的，无论是人是牲畜，冰雹必降在他们身上，他们就必死。’”
{Exo 9:20}  Then whoever feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses,
{Exo 9:20}  法老的臣仆中，惧怕耶和华这话的，便叫他的奴仆和牲畜跑进家来。
{Exo 9:21}  but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the LORD left his slaves and his livestock in the field.
{Exo 9:21}  但那不把耶和华这话放在心上的，就将他的奴仆和牲畜留在田里。
{Exo 9:22}  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and every plant of the field, in the land of Egypt."
{Exo 9:22}  耶和华对摩西说：“你向天伸杖，使埃及遍地的人身上和牲畜身上，并田间各样菜蔬上，都有冰雹。”
{Exo 9:23}  Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
{Exo 9:23}  摩西向天伸杖，耶和华就打雷下雹，有火闪到地上；耶和华下雹在埃及地上。
{Exo 9:24}  There was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy hail, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
{Exo 9:24}  那时，雹与火搀杂，甚是厉害，自从埃及成国以来，遍地没有这样的。
{Exo 9:25}  The hail struck down everything that was in the field in all the land of Egypt, both man and beast. And the hail struck down every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field.
{Exo 9:25}  在埃及遍地，雹击打了田间所有的人和牲畜，并一切的菜蔬，又打坏田间一切的树木。
{Exo 9:26}  Only in the land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, was there no hail.
{Exo 9:26}  惟独以色列人所住的歌珊地没有冰雹。
{Exo 9:27}  Then Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, "This time I have sinned; the LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
{Exo 9:27}  法老打发人召摩西、亚伦来，对他们说：“这一次我犯了罪了。耶和华是公义的；我和我的百姓是邪恶的。
{Exo 9:28}  Plead with the LORD, for there has been enough of God's thunder and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."
{Exo 9:28}  这雷轰和冰雹已经够了。请你们求耶和华，我就容你们去，不再留住你们。”
{Exo 9:29}  Moses said to him, "As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the LORD. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD's.
{Exo 9:29}  摩西对他说：“我一出城，就要向耶和华举手祷告；雷必止住，也不再有冰雹，叫你知道全地都是属耶和华的。
{Exo 9:30}  But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God."
{Exo 9:30}  至于你和你的臣仆，我知道你们还是不惧怕耶和华神。”
{Exo 9:31}  (The flax and the barley were struck down, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.
{Exo 9:31}  （那时，麻和大麦被雹击打；因为大麦已经吐穗，麻也开了花。
{Exo 9:32}  But the wheat and the emmer were not struck down, for they are late in coming up.)
{Exo 9:32}  只是小麦和粗麦没有被击打，因为还没有长成。）
{Exo 9:33}  So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and stretched out his hands to the LORD, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured upon the earth.
{Exo 9:33}  摩西离了法老出城，向耶和华举手祷告；雷和雹就止住，雨也不再浇在地上了。
{Exo 9:34}  But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
{Exo 9:34}  法老见雨和雹与雷止住，就越发犯罪；他和他的臣仆都硬着心。
{Exo 9:35}  So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.
{Exo 9:35}  法老的心刚硬，不容以色列人去，正如耶和华藉着摩西所说的。
{Exo 10:1}  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may show these signs of mine among them,
{Exo 10:1}  耶和华对摩西说：“你进去见法老。我使他和他臣仆的心刚硬，为要在他们中间显我这些神迹，
{Exo 10:2}  and that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your grandson how I have dealt harshly with the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them, that you may know that I am the LORD."
{Exo 10:2}  并要叫你将我向埃及人所做的事，和在他们中间所行的神迹，传于你儿子和你孙子的耳中，好叫你们知道我是耶和华。”
{Exo 10:3}  So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
{Exo 10:3}  摩西、亚伦就进去见法老，对他说：“耶和华希伯来人的神这样说：‘你在我面前不肯自卑要到几时呢？容我的百姓去，好事奉我。
{Exo 10:4}  For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,
{Exo 10:4}  你若不肯容我的百姓去，明天我要使蝗虫进入你的境内，
{Exo 10:5}  and they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see the land. And they shall eat what is left to you after the hail, and they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field,
{Exo 10:5}  遮满地面，甚至看不见地，并且吃那冰雹所剩的和田间所长的一切树木。
{Exo 10:6}  and they shall fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.'" Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
{Exo 10:6}  你的宫殿和你众臣仆的房屋，并一切埃及人的房屋，都要被蝗虫占满了；自从你祖宗和你祖宗的祖宗在世以来，直到今日，没有见过这样的灾。’”摩西就转身离开法老出去。
{Exo 10:7}  Then Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?"
{Exo 10:7}  法老的臣仆对法老说：“这人为我们的网罗要到几时呢？容这些人去事奉耶和华他们的神吧！埃及已经败坏了，你还不知道吗？”
{Exo 10:8}  So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. And he said to them, "Go, serve the LORD your God. But which ones are to go?"
{Exo 10:8}  于是摩西、亚伦被召回来见法老；法老对他们说：“你们去事奉耶和华你们的神；但那要去的是谁呢？”
{Exo 10:9}  Moses said, "We will go with our young and our old. We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD."
{Exo 10:9}  摩西说：“我们要和我们老的少的、儿子女儿同去，且把羊群牛群一同带去，因为我们务要向耶和华守节。”
{Exo 10:10} But he said to them, "The LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Look, you have some evil purpose in mind.
{Exo 10:10} 法老对他们说：“我容你们和你们妇人孩子去的时候，耶和华与你们同在吧！你们要谨慎；因为有祸在你们眼前（或作：你们存着恶意），
{Exo 10:11} No! Go, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you are asking." And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
{Exo 10:11} 不可都去！你们这壮年人去事奉耶和华吧，因为这是你们所求的。”于是把他们从法老面前撵出去。
{Exo 10:12} Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come upon the land of Egypt and eat every plant in the land, all that the hail has left."
{Exo 10:12} 耶和华对摩西说：“你向埃及地伸杖，使蝗虫到埃及地上来，吃地上一切的菜蔬，就是冰雹所剩的。”
{Exo 10:13} So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind had brought the locusts.
{Exo 10:13} 摩西就向埃及地伸杖，那一昼一夜，耶和华使东风刮在埃及地上；到了早晨，东风把蝗虫刮了来。
{Exo 10:14} The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country of Egypt, such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever will be again.
{Exo 10:14} 蝗虫上来，落在埃及的四境，甚是厉害；以前没有这样的，以后也必没有。
{Exo 10:15} They covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened, and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
{Exo 10:15} 因为这蝗虫遮满地面，甚至地都黑暗了，又吃地上一切的菜蔬和冰雹所剩树上的果子。埃及遍地，无论是树木，是田间的菜蔬，连一点青的也没有留下。
{Exo 10:16} Then Pharaoh hastily called Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
{Exo 10:16} 于是法老急忙召了摩西、亚伦来，说：“我得罪耶和华你们的神，又得罪了你们。
{Exo 10:17} Now therefore, forgive my sin, please, only this once, and plead with the LORD your God only to remove this death from me."
{Exo 10:17} 现在求你，只这一次，饶恕我的罪，求耶和华你们的神使我脱离这一次的死亡。”
{Exo 10:18} So he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD.
{Exo 10:18} 摩西就离开法老去求耶和华。
{Exo 10:19} And the LORD turned the wind into a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt.
{Exo 10:19} 耶和华转了极大的西风，把蝗虫刮起，吹入红海；在埃及的四境连一个也没有留下。
{Exo 10:20} But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go.
{Exo 10:20} 但耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不容以色列人去。
{Exo 10:21} Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness to be felt."
{Exo 10:21} 耶和华对摩西说：“你向天伸杖，使埃及地黑暗；这黑暗似乎摸得着。”
{Exo 10:22} So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was pitch darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
{Exo 10:22} 摩西向天伸杖，埃及遍地就乌黑了三天。
{Exo 10:23} They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the people of Israel had light where they lived.
{Exo 10:23} 三天之久，人不能相见，谁也不敢起来离开本处；惟有以色列人家中都有亮光。
{Exo 10:24} Then Pharaoh called Moses and said, "Go, serve the LORD; your little ones also may go with you; only let your flocks and your herds remain behind."
{Exo 10:24} 法老就召摩西来，说：“你们去事奉耶和华；只是你们的羊群牛群要留下；你们的妇人孩子可以和你们同去。”
{Exo 10:25} But Moses said, "You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
{Exo 10:25} 摩西说：“你总要把祭物和燔祭牲交给我们，使我们可以祭祀耶和华我们的神。
{Exo 10:26} Our livestock also must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we must take of them to serve the LORD our God, and we do not know with what we must serve the LORD until we arrive there."
{Exo 10:26} 我们的牲畜也要带去，连一蹄也不留下；因为我们要从其中取出来，事奉耶和华我们的神。我们未到那里，还不知道用什么事奉耶和华。”
{Exo 10:27} But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
{Exo 10:27} 但耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不肯容他们去。
{Exo 10:28} Then Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me; take care never to see my face again, for on the day you see my face you shall die."
{Exo 10:28} 法老对摩西说：“你离开我去吧，你要小心，不要再见我的面！因为你见我面的那日你就必死！”
{Exo 10:29} Moses said, "As you say! I will not see your face again."
{Exo 10:29} 摩西说：“你说得好！我必不再见你的面了。”
{Exo 11:1}  The LORD said to Moses, "Yet one plague more I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will drive you away completely.
{Exo 11:1}  耶和华对摩西说：“我再使一样的灾殃临到法老和埃及，然后他必容你们离开这地。他容你们去的时候，总要催逼你们都从这地出去。
{Exo 11:2}  Speak now in the hearing of the people, that they ask, every man of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor, for silver and gold jewelry."
{Exo 11:2}  你要传于百姓的耳中，叫他们男女各人向邻舍要金器银器。”
{Exo 11:3}  And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.
{Exo 11:3}  耶和华叫百姓在埃及人眼前蒙恩，并且摩西在埃及地、法老臣仆，和百姓的眼中看为极大。
{Exo 11:4}  So Moses said, "Thus says the LORD: 'About midnight I will go out in the midst of Egypt,
{Exo 11:4}  摩西说：“耶和华这样说：‘约到半夜，我必出去巡行埃及遍地。
{Exo 11:5}  and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the handmill, and all the firstborn of the cattle.
{Exo 11:5}  凡在埃及地，从坐宝座的法老直到磨子后的婢女所有的长子，以及一切头生的牲畜，都必死。
{Exo 11:6}  There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has never been, nor ever will be again.
{Exo 11:6}  埃及遍地必有大哀号；从前没有这样的，后来也必没有。
{Exo 11:7}  But not a dog shall growl against any of the people of Israel, either man or beast, that you may know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.'
{Exo 11:7}  至于以色列中，无论是人是牲畜，连狗也不敢向他们摇舌，好叫你们知道耶和华是将埃及人和以色列人分别出来。’
{Exo 11:8}  And all these your servants shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying, 'Get out, you and all the people who follow you.' And after that I will go out." And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
{Exo 11:8}  你这一切臣仆都要俯伏来见我，说：‘求你和跟从你的百姓都出去’，然后我要出去。”于是，摩西气忿忿地离开法老，出去了。
{Exo 11:9}  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
{Exo 11:9}  耶和华对摩西说：“法老必不听你们，使我的奇事在埃及地多起来。”
{Exo 11:10} Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go out of his land.
{Exo 11:10} 摩西、亚伦在法老面前行了这一切奇事；耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不容以色列人出离他的地。
{Exo 12:1}  The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
{Exo 12:1}  耶和华在埃及地晓谕摩西、亚伦说：
{Exo 12:2}  "This month shall be for you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year for you.
{Exo 12:2}  “你们要以本月为正月，为一年之首。
{Exo 12:3}  Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household.
{Exo 12:3}  你们吩咐以色列全会众说：本月初十日，各人要按着父家取羊羔，一家一只。
{Exo 12:4}  And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.
{Exo 12:4}  若是一家的人太少，吃不了一只羊羔，本人就要和他隔壁的邻舍共取一只。你们预备羊羔，要按着人数和饭量计算。
{Exo 12:5}  Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats,
{Exo 12:5}  要无残疾、一岁的公羊羔，你们或从绵羊里取，或从山羊里取，都可以。
{Exo 12:6}  and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight.
{Exo 12:6}  要留到本月十四日，在黄昏的时候，以色列全会众把羊羔宰了。
{Exo 12:7}  "Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
{Exo 12:7}  各家要取点血，涂在吃羊羔的房屋左右的门框上和门楣上。
{Exo 12:8}  They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted on the fire; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it.
{Exo 12:8}  当夜要吃羊羔的肉；用火烤了，与无酵饼和苦菜同吃。
{Exo 12:9}  Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted, its head with its legs and its inner parts.
{Exo 12:9}  不可吃生的，断不可吃水煮的，要带着头、腿、五脏，用火烤了吃。
{Exo 12:10} And you shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.
{Exo 12:10} 不可剩下一点留到早晨；若留到早晨，要用火烧了。
{Exo 12:11} In this manner you shall eat it: with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. It is the LORD's Passover.
{Exo 12:11} 你们吃羊羔当腰间束带，脚上穿鞋，手中拿杖，赶紧地吃；这是耶和华的逾越节。
{Exo 12:12} For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD.
{Exo 12:12} 因为那夜我要巡行埃及地，把埃及地一切头生的，无论是人是牲畜，都击杀了，又要败坏埃及一切的神。我是耶和华。
{Exo 12:13} The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.
{Exo 12:13} 这血要在你们所住的房屋上作记号；我一见这血，就越过你们去。我击杀埃及地头生的时候，灾殃必不临到你们身上灭你们。”
{Exo 12:14} "This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast.
{Exo 12:14} “你们要记念这日，守为耶和华的节，作为你们世世代代永远的定例。
{Exo 12:15} Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven out of your houses, for if anyone eats what is leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.
{Exo 12:15} 你们要吃无酵饼七日。头一日要把酵从你们各家中除去；因为从头一日起，到第七日为止，凡吃有酵之饼的，必从以色列中剪除。
{Exo 12:16} On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly, and on the seventh day a holy assembly. No work shall be done on those days. But what everyone needs to eat, that alone may be prepared by you.
{Exo 12:16} 头一日你们当有圣会，第七日也当有圣会。这两日之内，除了预备各人所要吃的以外，无论何工都不可做。
{Exo 12:17} And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day, throughout your generations, as a statute forever.
{Exo 12:17} 你们要守无酵节，因为我正当这日把你们的军队从埃及地领出来。所以，你们要守这日，作为世世代代永远的定例。
{Exo 12:18} In the first month, from the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.
{Exo 12:18} 从正月十四日晚上，直到二十一日晚上，你们要吃无酵饼。
{Exo 12:19} For seven days no leaven is to be found in your houses. If anyone eats what is leavened, that person will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land.
{Exo 12:19} 在你们各家中，七日之内不可有酵；因为凡吃有酵之物的，无论是寄居的，是本地的，必从以色列的会中剪除。
{Exo 12:20} You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened bread."
{Exo 12:20} 有酵的物，你们都不可吃；在你们一切住处要吃无酵饼。”
{Exo 12:21} Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go and select lambs for yourselves according to your clans, and kill the Passover lamb.
{Exo 12:21} 于是，摩西召了以色列的众长老来，对他们说：“你们要按着家口取出羊羔，把这逾越节的羊羔宰了。
{Exo 12:22} Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
{Exo 12:22} 拿一把牛膝草，蘸盆里的血，打在门楣上和左右的门框上。你们谁也不可出自己的房门，直到早晨。
{Exo 12:23} For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you.
{Exo 12:23} 因为耶和华要巡行击杀埃及人，他看见血在门楣上和左右的门框上，就必越过那门，不容灭命的进你们的房屋，击杀你们。
{Exo 12:24} You shall observe this rite as a statute for you and for your sons forever.
{Exo 12:24} 这例，你们要守着，作为你们和你们子孙永远的定例。
{Exo 12:25} And when you come to the land that the LORD will give you, as he has promised, you shall keep this service.
{Exo 12:25} 日后，你们到了耶和华按着所应许赐给你们的那地，就要守这礼。
{Exo 12:26} And when your children say to you, 'What do you mean by this service?'
{Exo 12:26} 你们的儿女问你们说：‘行这礼是什么意思？’
{Exo 12:27} you shall say, 'It is the sacrifice of the LORD's Passover, for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses.'" And the people bowed their heads and worshiped.
{Exo 12:27} 你们就说：‘这是献给耶和华逾越节的祭。当以色列人在埃及的时候，他击杀埃及人，越过以色列人的房屋，救了我们各家。’”于是百姓低头下拜。
{Exo 12:28} Then the people of Israel went and did so; as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
{Exo 12:28} 耶和华怎样吩咐摩西、亚伦，以色列人就怎样行。
{Exo 12:29} At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock.
{Exo 12:29} 到了半夜，耶和华把埃及地所有的长子，就是从坐宝座的法老，直到被掳囚在监里之人的长子，以及一切头生的牲畜，尽都杀了。
{Exo 12:30} And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians. And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where someone was not dead.
{Exo 12:30} 法老和一切臣仆，并埃及众人，夜间都起来了。在埃及有大哀号，无一家不死一个人的。
{Exo 12:31} Then he summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said, "Up, go out from among my people, both you and the people of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.
{Exo 12:31} 夜间，法老召了摩西、亚伦来，说：“起来！连你们带以色列人，从我民中出去，依你们所说的，去事奉耶和华吧！
{Exo 12:32} Take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone, and bless me also!"
{Exo 12:32} 也依你们所说的，连羊群牛群带着走吧！并要为我祝福。”
{Exo 12:33} The Egyptians were urgent with the people to send them out of the land in haste. For they said, "We shall all be dead."
{Exo 12:33} 埃及人催促百姓，打发他们快快出离那地，因为埃及人说：“我们都要死了。”
{Exo 12:34} So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders.
{Exo 12:34} 百姓就拿着没有酵的生面，把抟面盆包在衣服中，扛在肩头上。
{Exo 12:35} The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them, for they had asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing.
{Exo 12:35} 以色列人照着摩西的话行，向埃及人要金器、银器，和衣裳。
{Exo 12:36} And the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.
{Exo 12:36} 耶和华叫百姓在埃及人眼前蒙恩，以致埃及人给他们所要的。他们就把埃及人的财物夺去了。
{Exo 12:37} And the people of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
{Exo 12:37} 以色列人从兰塞起行，往疏割去；除了妇人孩子，步行的男人约有六十万。
{Exo 12:38} A mixed multitude also went up with them, and very much livestock, both flocks and herds.
{Exo 12:38} 又有许多闲杂人，并有羊群牛群，和他们一同上去。
{Exo 12:39} And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.
{Exo 12:39} 他们用埃及带出来的生面烤成无酵饼。这生面原没有发起；因为他们被催逼离开埃及，不能耽延，也没有为自己预备什么食物。
{Exo 12:40} The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years.
{Exo 12:40} 以色列人住在埃及共有四百三十年。
{Exo 12:41} At the end of 430 years, on that very day, all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
{Exo 12:41} 正满了四百三十年的那一天，耶和华的军队都从埃及地出来了。
{Exo 12:42} It was a night of watching by the LORD, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; so this same night is a night of watching kept to the LORD by all the people of Israel throughout their generations.
{Exo 12:42} 这夜是耶和华的夜；因耶和华领他们出了埃及地，所以当向耶和华谨守，是以色列众人世世代代该谨守的。
{Exo 12:43} And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner shall eat of it,
{Exo 12:43} 耶和华对摩西、亚伦说：“逾越节的例是这样：外邦人都不可吃这羊羔。
{Exo 12:44} but every slave that is bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him.
{Exo 12:44} 但各人用银子买的奴仆，既受了割礼就可以吃。
{Exo 12:45} No foreigner or hired worker may eat of it.
{Exo 12:45} 寄居的和雇工人都不可吃。
{Exo 12:46} It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the flesh outside the house, and you shall not break any of its bones.
{Exo 12:46} 应当在一个房子里吃；不可把一点肉从房子里带到外头去。羊羔的骨头一根也不可折断。
{Exo 12:47} All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
{Exo 12:47} 以色列全会众都要守这礼。
{Exo 12:48} If a stranger shall sojourn with you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised. Then he may come near and keep it; he shall be as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
{Exo 12:48} 若有外人寄居在你们中间，愿向耶和华守逾越节，他所有的男子务要受割礼，然后才容他前来遵守，他也就像本地人一样；但未受割礼的，都不可吃这羊羔。
{Exo 12:49} There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you."
{Exo 12:49} 本地人和寄居在你们中间的外人同归一例。”
{Exo 12:50} All the people of Israel did just as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.
{Exo 12:50} 耶和华怎样吩咐摩西、亚伦，以色列众人就怎样行了。
{Exo 12:51} And on that very day the LORD brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.
{Exo 12:51} 正当那日，耶和华将以色列人按着他们的军队，从埃及地领出来。
{Exo 13:1}  The LORD said to Moses,
{Exo 13:1}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Exo 13:2}  "Consecrate to me all the firstborn. Whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel, both of man and of beast, is mine."
{Exo 13:2}  “以色列中凡头生的，无论是人是牲畜，都是我的，要分别为圣归我。”
{Exo 13:3}  Then Moses said to the people, "Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery, for by a strong hand the LORD brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten.
{Exo 13:3}  摩西对百姓说：“你们要记念从埃及为奴之家出来的这日，因为耶和华用大能的手将你们从这地方领出来。有酵的饼都不可吃。
{Exo 13:4}  Today, in the month of Abib, you are going out.
{Exo 13:4}  亚笔月间的这日是你们出来的日子。
{Exo 13:5}  And when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall keep this service in this month.
{Exo 13:5}  将来耶和华领你进迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、希未人、耶布斯人之地，就是他向你的祖宗起誓应许给你那流奶与蜜之地，那时你要在这月间守这礼。
{Exo 13:6}  Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.
{Exo 13:6}  你要吃无酵饼七日，到第七日要向耶和华守节。
{Exo 13:7}  Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen with you, and no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory.
{Exo 13:7}  这七日之久，要吃无酵饼；在你四境之内不可见有酵的饼，也不可见发酵的物。
{Exo 13:8}  You shall tell your son on that day, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
{Exo 13:8}  当那日，你要告诉你的儿子说：‘这是因耶和华在我出埃及的时候为我所行的事。
{Exo 13:9}  And it shall be to you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth. For with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt.
{Exo 13:9}  这要在你手上作记号，在你额上作纪念，使耶和华的律法常在你口中，因为耶和华曾用大能的手将你从埃及领出来。
{Exo 13:10} You shall therefore keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
{Exo 13:10} 所以你每年要按着日期守这例。’”
{Exo 13:11} "When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and your fathers, and shall give it to you,
{Exo 13:11} “将来，耶和华照他向你和你祖宗所起的誓将你领进迦南人之地，把这地赐给你，
{Exo 13:12} you shall set apart to the LORD all that first opens the womb. All the firstborn of your animals that are males shall be the LORD's.
{Exo 13:12} 那时你要将一切头生的，并牲畜中头生的，归给耶和华；公的都要属耶和华。
{Exo 13:13} Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. Every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem.
{Exo 13:13} 凡头生的驴，你要用羊羔代赎；若不代赎，就要打折他的颈项。凡你儿子中头生的都要赎出来。
{Exo 13:14} And when in time to come your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' you shall say to him, 'By a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
{Exo 13:14} 日后，你的儿子问你说：‘这是什么意思？’你就说：‘耶和华用大能的手将我们从埃及为奴之家领出来。
{Exo 13:15} For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all the males that first open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.'
{Exo 13:15} 那时法老几乎不容我们去，耶和华就把埃及地所有头生的，无论是人是牲畜，都杀了。因此，我把一切头生的公牲畜献给耶和华为祭，但将头生的儿子都赎出来。
{Exo 13:16} It shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes, for by a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt."
{Exo 13:16} 这要在你手上作记号，在你额上作经文，因为耶和华用大能的手将我们从埃及领出来。’”
{Exo 13:17} When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, "Lest the people change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt."
{Exo 13:17} 法老容百姓去的时候，非利士地的道路虽近，神却不领他们从那里走；因为神说：“恐怕百姓遇见打仗后悔，就回埃及去。”
{Exo 13:18} But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And the people of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt equipped for battle.
{Exo 13:18} 所以神领百姓绕道而行，走红海旷野的路。以色列人出埃及地，都带着兵器上去。
{Exo 13:19} Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones with you from here."
{Exo 13:19} 摩西把约瑟的骸骨一同带去；因为约瑟曾叫以色列人严严地起誓，对他们说：“神必眷顾你们，你们要把我的骸骨从这里一同带上去。”
{Exo 13:20} And they moved on from Succoth and encamped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
{Exo 13:20} 他们从疏割起行，在旷野边的以倘安营。
{Exo 13:21} And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.
{Exo 13:21} 日间，耶和华在云柱中领他们的路；夜间，在火柱中光照他们，使他们日夜都可以行走。
{Exo 13:22} The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.
{Exo 13:22} 日间云柱，夜间火柱，总不离开百姓的面前。
{Exo 14:1}  Then the LORD said to Moses,
{Exo 14:1}  耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Exo 14:2}  "Tell the people of Israel to turn back and encamp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon; you shall encamp facing it, by the sea.
{Exo 14:2}  “你吩咐以色列人转回，安营在比哈希录前，密夺和海的中间，对着巴力洗分，靠近海边安营。
{Exo 14:3}  For Pharaoh will say of the people of Israel, 'They are wandering in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.'
{Exo 14:3}  法老必说：‘以色列人在地中绕迷了，旷野把他们困住了。’
{Exo 14:4}  And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD." And they did so.
{Exo 14:4}  我要使法老的心刚硬，他要追赶他们，我便在法老和他全军身上得荣耀；埃及人就知道我是耶和华。”于是以色列人这样行了。
{Exo 14:5}  When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the mind of Pharaoh and his servants was changed toward the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
{Exo 14:5}  有人告诉埃及王说：“百姓逃跑。”法老和他的臣仆就向百姓变心，说：“我们容以色列人去，不再服事我们，这做的是什么事呢？”
{Exo 14:6}  So he made ready his chariot and took his army with him,
{Exo 14:6}  法老就预备他的车辆，带领军兵同去，
{Exo 14:7}  and took six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.
{Exo 14:7}  并带着六百辆特选的车和埃及所有的车，每辆都有车兵长。
{Exo 14:8}  And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the people of Israel while the people of Israel were going out defiantly.
{Exo 14:8}  耶和华使埃及王法老的心刚硬，他就追赶以色列人，因为以色列人是昂然无惧地出埃及。
{Exo 14:9}  The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them encamped at the sea, by Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
{Exo 14:9}  埃及人追赶他们，法老一切的马匹、车辆、马兵，与军兵就在海边上，靠近比哈希录，对着巴力洗分，在他们安营的地方追上了。
{Exo 14:10} When Pharaoh drew near, the people of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they feared greatly. And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD.
{Exo 14:10} 法老临近的时候，以色列人举目看见埃及人赶来，就甚惧怕，向耶和华哀求。
{Exo 14:11} They said to Moses, "Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt?
{Exo 14:11} 他们对摩西说：“难道在埃及没有坟地，你把我们带来死在旷野吗？你为什么这样待我们，将我们从埃及领出来呢？
{Exo 14:12} Is not this what we said to you in Egypt: 'Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."
{Exo 14:12} 我们在埃及岂没有对你说过，不要搅扰我们，容我们服事埃及人吗？因为服事埃及人比死在旷野还好。”
{Exo 14:13} And Moses said to the people, "Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.
{Exo 14:13} 摩西对百姓说：“不要惧怕，只管站住！看耶和华今天向你们所要施行的救恩。因为，你们今天所看见的埃及人必永远不再看见了。
{Exo 14:14} The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be silent."
{Exo 14:14} 耶和华必为你们争战；你们只管静默，不要作声。”
{Exo 14:15} The LORD said to Moses, "Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.
{Exo 14:15} 耶和华对摩西说：“你为什么向我哀求呢？你吩咐以色列人往前走。
{Exo 14:16} Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.
{Exo 14:16} 你举手向海伸杖，把水分开。以色列人要下海中走干地。
{Exo 14:17} And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen.
{Exo 14:17} 我要使埃及人的心刚硬，他们就跟着下去。我要在法老和他的全军、车辆、马兵上得荣耀。
{Exo 14:18} And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."
{Exo 14:18} 我在法老和他的车辆、马兵上得荣耀的时候，埃及人就知道我是耶和华了。”
{Exo 14:19} Then the angel of God who was going before the host of Israel moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them,
{Exo 14:19} 在以色列营前行走神的使者，转到他们后边去；云柱也从他们前边转到他们后边立住。
{Exo 14:20} coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness. And it lit up the night without one coming near the other all night.
{Exo 14:20} 在埃及营和以色列营中间有云柱，一边黑暗，一边发光，终夜两下不得相近。
{Exo 14:21} Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
{Exo 14:21} 摩西向海伸杖，耶和华便用大东风，使海水一夜退去，水便分开，海就成了干地。
{Exo 14:22} And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
{Exo 14:22} 以色列人下海中走干地，水在他们的左右作了墙垣。
{Exo 14:23} The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
{Exo 14:23} 埃及人追赶他们，法老一切的马匹、车辆，和马兵都跟着下到海中。
{Exo 14:24} And in the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic,
{Exo 14:24} 到了晨更的时候，耶和华从云火柱中向埃及的军兵观看，使埃及的军兵混乱了；
{Exo 14:25} clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily. And the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from before Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians."
{Exo 14:25} 又使他们的车轮脱落，难以行走，以致埃及人说：“我们从以色列人面前逃跑吧！因耶和华为他们攻击我们了。”
{Exo 14:26} Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen."
{Exo 14:26} 耶和华对摩西说：“你向海伸杖，叫水仍合在埃及人并他们的车辆、马兵身上。”
{Exo 14:27} So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the LORD threw the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.
{Exo 14:27} 摩西就向海伸杖，到了天一亮，海水仍旧复原。埃及人避水逃跑的时候，耶和华把他们推翻在海中，
{Exo 14:28} The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, not one of them remained.
{Exo 14:28} 水就回流，淹没了车辆和马兵。那些跟着以色列人下海法老的全军，连一个也没有剩下。
{Exo 14:29} But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
{Exo 14:29} 以色列人却在海中走干地；水在他们的左右作了墙垣。
{Exo 14:30} Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
{Exo 14:30} 当日，耶和华这样拯救以色列人脱离埃及人的手，以色列人看见埃及人的死尸都在海边了。
{Exo 14:31} Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.
{Exo 14:31} 以色列人看见耶和华向埃及人所行的大事，就敬畏耶和华，又信服他和他的仆人摩西。
{Exo 15:1}  Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the LORD, saying, "I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.
{Exo 15:1}  那时，摩西和以色列人向耶和华唱歌说：我要向耶和华歌唱，因他大大战胜，将马和骑马的投在海中。
{Exo 15:2}  The LORD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him.
{Exo 15:2}  耶和华是我的力量，我的诗歌，也成了我的拯救。这是我的神，我要赞美他，是我父亲的神，我要尊崇他。
{Exo 15:3}  The LORD is a man of war; the LORD is his name.
{Exo 15:3}  耶和华是战士；他的名是耶和华。
{Exo 15:4}  "Pharaoh's chariots and his host he cast into the sea, and his chosen officers were sunk in the Red Sea.
{Exo 15:4}  法老的车辆、军兵，耶和华已抛在海中；他特选的军长都沉于红海。
{Exo 15:5}  The floods covered them; they went down into the depths like a stone.
{Exo 15:5}  深水淹没他们；他们如同石头坠到深处。
{Exo 15:6}  Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power, your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy.
{Exo 15:6}  耶和华啊，你的右手施展能力，显出荣耀；耶和华啊，你的右手摔碎仇敌。
{Exo 15:7}  In the greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries; you send out your fury; it consumes them like stubble.
{Exo 15:7}  你大发威严，推翻那些起来攻击你的；你发出烈怒如火，烧灭他们像烧碎一样。
{Exo 15:8}  At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up; the floods stood up in a heap; the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.
{Exo 15:8}  你发鼻中的气，水便聚起成堆，大水直立如垒，海中的深水凝结。
{Exo 15:9}  The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my desire shall have its fill of them. I will draw my sword; my hand shall destroy them.'
{Exo 15:9}  仇敌说：我要追赶，我要追上；我要分掳物，我要在他们身上称我的心愿。我要拔出刀来，亲手杀灭他们。
{Exo 15:10} You blew with your wind; the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
{Exo 15:10} 你叫风一吹，海就把他们淹没；他们如铅沉在大水之中。
{Exo 15:11} "Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?
{Exo 15:11} 耶和华啊，众神之中，谁能像你？谁能像你至圣至荣，可颂可畏，施行奇事？

{Exo 15:12} 你伸出右手，地便吞灭他们。
{Exo 15:13} "You have led in your steadfast love the people whom you have redeemed; you have guided them by your strength to your holy abode.
{Exo 15:13} 你凭慈爱领了你所赎的百姓；你凭能力引他们到了你的圣所。
{Exo 15:14} The peoples have heard; they tremble; pangs have seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
{Exo 15:14} 外邦人听见就发颤；疼痛抓住非利士的居民。
{Exo 15:15} Now are the chiefs of Edom dismayed; trembling seizes the leaders of Moab; all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
{Exo 15:15} 那时，以东的族长惊惶，摩押的英雄被战兢抓住，迦南的居民心都消化了。
{Exo 15:16} Terror and dread fall upon them; because of the greatness of your arm, they are still as a stone, till your people, O LORD, pass by, till the people pass by whom you have purchased.
{Exo 15:16} 惊骇恐惧临到他们。耶和华啊，因你膀臂的大能，他们如石头寂然不动，等候你的百姓过去，等候你所赎的百姓过去。
{Exo 15:17} You will bring them in and plant them on your own mountain, the place, O LORD, which you have made for your abode, the sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have established.
{Exo 15:17} 你要将他们领进去，栽于你产业的山上，耶和华啊，就是你为自己所造的住处；主啊，就是你手所建立的圣所。
{Exo 15:18} The LORD will reign forever and ever."
{Exo 15:18} 耶和华必作王，直到永永远远！
{Exo 15:19} For when the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them, but the people of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea.
{Exo 15:19} 法老的马匹、车辆，和马兵下到海中，耶和华使海水回流，淹没他们；惟有以色列人在海中走干地。
{Exo 15:20} Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambourines and dancing.
{Exo 15:20} 亚伦的姊姊，女先知米利暗，手里拿着鼓；众妇女也跟他出去拿鼓跳舞。
{Exo 15:21} And Miriam sang to them: "Sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea."
{Exo 15:21} 米利暗应声说：你们要歌颂耶和华，因他大大战胜，将马和骑马的投在海中。
{Exo 15:22} Then Moses made Israel set out from the Red Sea, and they went into the wilderness of Shur. They went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
{Exo 15:22} 摩西领以色列人从红海往前行，到了书珥的旷野，在旷野走了三天，找不着水。
{Exo 15:23} When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter; therefore it was named Marah.
{Exo 15:23} 到了玛拉，不能喝那里的水；因为水苦，所以那地名叫玛拉。
{Exo 15:24} And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
{Exo 15:24} 百姓就向摩西发怨言，说：“我们喝什么呢？”
{Exo 15:25} And he cried to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a log, and he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There the LORD made for them a statute and a rule, and there he tested them,
{Exo 15:25} 摩西呼求耶和华，耶和华指示他一棵树。他把树丢在水里，水就变甜了。耶和华在那里为他们定了律例、典章，在那里试验他们；
{Exo 15:26} saying, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and do that which is right in his eyes, and give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you that I put on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, your healer."
{Exo 15:26} 又说：“你若留意听耶和华你神的话，又行我眼中看为正的事，留心听我的诫命，守我一切的律例，我就不将所加与埃及人的疾病加在你身上，因为我耶和华是医治你的。”
{Exo 15:27} Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they encamped there by the water.
{Exo 15:27} 他们到了以琳，在那里有十二股水泉，七十棵棕树；他们就在那里的水边安营。
{Exo 16:1}  They set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the people of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt.
{Exo 16:1}  以色列全会众从以琳起行，在出埃及后第二个月十五日到了以琳和西乃中间、汛的旷野。
{Exo 16:2}  And the whole congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness,
{Exo 16:2}  以色列全会众在旷野向摩西、亚伦发怨言，
{Exo 16:3}  and the people of Israel said to them, "Would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots and ate bread to the full, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
{Exo 16:3}  说：“巴不得我们早死在埃及地、耶和华的手下；那时我们坐在肉锅旁边，吃得饱足。你们将我们领出来，到这旷野，是要叫这全会众都饿死啊！”
{Exo 16:4}  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.
{Exo 16:4}  耶和华对摩西说：“我要将粮食从天降给你们。百姓可以出去，每天收每天的分，我好试验他们遵不遵我的法度。
{Exo 16:5}  On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily."
{Exo 16:5}  到第六天，他们要把所收进来的预备好了，比每天所收的多一倍。”
{Exo 16:6}  So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, "At evening you shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
{Exo 16:6}  摩西、亚伦对以色列众人说：“到了晚上，你们要知道是耶和华将你们从埃及地领出来的。
{Exo 16:7}  and in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against the LORD. For what are we, that you grumble against us?"
{Exo 16:7}  早晨，你们要看见耶和华的荣耀，因为耶和华听见你们向他所发的怨言了。我们算什么，你们竟向我们发怨言呢？”
{Exo 16:8}  And Moses said, "When the LORD gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the LORD has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him--what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the LORD."
{Exo 16:8}  摩西又说：“耶和华晚上必给你们肉吃，早晨必给你们食物得饱；因为你们向耶和华发的怨言，他都听见了。我们算什么，你们的怨言不是向我们发的，乃是向耶和华发的。”
{Exo 16:9}  Then Moses said to Aaron, "Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, 'Come near before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.'"
{Exo 16:9}  摩西对亚伦说：“你告诉以色列全会众说：‘你们就近耶和华面前，因为他已经听见你们的怨言了。’”
{Exo 16:10} And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
{Exo 16:10} 亚伦正对以色列全会众说话的时候，他们向旷野观看，不料，耶和华的荣光在云中显现。
{Exo 16:11} And the LORD said to Moses,
{Exo 16:11} 耶和华晓谕摩西说：
{Exo 16:12} "I have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel. Say to them, 'At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'"
{Exo 16:12} “我已经听见以色列人的怨言。你告诉他们说：‘到黄昏的时候，你们要吃肉，早晨必有食物得饱，你们就知道我是耶和华你们的神。’”
{Exo 16:13} In the evening quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp.
{Exo 16:13} 到了晚上，有鹌鹑飞来，遮满了营；早晨在营四围的地上有露水。
{Exo 16:14} And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground.
{Exo 16:14} 露水上升之后，不料，野地面上有如白霜的小圆物。
{Exo 16:15} When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, "It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat.
{Exo 16:15} 以色列人看见，不知道是什么，就彼此对问说：“这是什么呢？”摩西对他们说：“这就是耶和华给你们吃的食物。
{Exo 16:16} This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an omer, according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.'"
{Exo 16:16} 耶和华所吩咐的是这样：你们要按着各人的饭量，为帐棚里的人，按着人数收起来，各拿一俄梅珥。”
{Exo 16:17} And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less.
{Exo 16:17} 以色列人就这样行；有多收的，有少收的。
{Exo 16:18} But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat.
{Exo 16:18} 及至用俄梅珥量一量，多收的也没有余，少收的也没有缺；各人按着自己的饭量收取。
{Exo 16:19} And Moses said to them, "Let no one leave any of it over till the morning."
{Exo 16:19} 摩西对他们说：“所收的，不许什么人留到早晨。”
{Exo 16:20} But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them.
{Exo 16:20} 然而他们不听摩西的话，内中有留到早晨的，就生虫变臭了；摩西便向他们发怒。
{Exo 16:21} Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.
{Exo 16:21} 他们每日早晨，按着各人的饭量收取，日头一发热，就消化了。
{Exo 16:22} On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each. And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,
{Exo 16:22} 到第六天，他们收了双倍的食物，每人两俄梅珥。会众的官长来告诉摩西；
{Exo 16:23} he said to them, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.'"
{Exo 16:23} 摩西对他们说：“耶和华这样说：‘明天是圣安息日，是向耶和华守的圣安息日。你们要烤的就烤了，要煮的就煮了，所剩下的都留到早晨。’”
{Exo 16:24} So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded them, and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it.
{Exo 16:24} 他们就照摩西的吩咐留到早晨，也不臭，里头也没有虫子。
{Exo 16:25} Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field.
{Exo 16:25} 摩西说：“你们今天吃这个吧！因为今天是向耶和华守的安息日；你们在田野必找不着了。
{Exo 16:26} Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none."
{Exo 16:26} 六天可以收取，第七天乃是安息日，那一天必没有了。”
{Exo 16:27} On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.
{Exo 16:27} 第七天，百姓中有人出去收，什么也找不着。
{Exo 16:28} And the LORD said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
{Exo 16:28} 耶和华对摩西说：“你们不肯守我的诫命和律法，要到几时呢？
{Exo 16:29} See! The LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day."
{Exo 16:29} 你们看！耶和华既将安息日赐给你们，所以第六天他赐给你们两天的食物，第七天各人要住在自己的地方，不许什么人出去。”
{Exo 16:30} So the people rested on the seventh day.
{Exo 16:30} 于是百姓第七天安息了。
{Exo 16:31} Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
{Exo 16:31} 这食物，以色列家叫吗哪；样子像芫荽子，颜色是白的，滋味如同搀蜜的薄饼。
{Exo 16:32} Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"
{Exo 16:32} 摩西说：“耶和华所吩咐的是这样：‘要将一满俄梅珥（俄梅珥就是伊法十分之一）吗哪留到世世代代，使后人可以看见我当日将你们领出埃及地，在旷野所给你们吃的食物。’”
{Exo 16:33} And Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations."
{Exo 16:33} 摩西对亚伦说：“你拿一个罐子，盛一满俄梅珥吗哪，存在耶和华面前，要留到世世代代。”
{Exo 16:34} As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept.
{Exo 16:34} 耶和华怎么吩咐摩西，亚伦就怎么行，把吗哪放在法柜前存留。
{Exo 16:35} The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
{Exo 16:35} 以色列人吃吗哪共四十年，直到进了有人居住之地，就是迦南的境界。
{Exo 16:36} (An omer is the tenth part of an ephah.)
{Exo 16:36} (SEE 16:35)
{Exo 17:1}  All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
{Exo 17:1}  以色列全会众都遵耶和华的吩咐，按着站口从汛的旷野往前行，在利非订安营。百姓没有水喝，
{Exo 17:2}  Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water to drink." And Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?"
{Exo 17:2}  所以与摩西争闹，说：“给我们水喝吧！”摩西对他们说：“你们为什么与我争闹？为什么试探耶和华呢？”
{Exo 17:3}  But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, "Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?"
{Exo 17:3}  百姓在那里甚渴，要喝水，就向摩西发怨言，说：“你为什么将我们从埃及领出来，使我们和我们的儿女并牲畜都渴死呢？”
{Exo 17:4}  So Moses cried to the LORD, "What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me."
{Exo 17:4}  摩西就呼求耶和华说：“我向这百姓怎样行呢？他们几乎要拿石头打死我。”
{Exo 17:5}  And the LORD said to Moses, "Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
{Exo 17:5}  耶和华对摩西说：“你手里拿着你先前击打河水的杖，带领以色列的几个长老，从百姓面前走过去。
{Exo 17:6}  Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink." And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel.
{Exo 17:6}  我必在何烈的磐石那里，站在你面前。你要击打磐石，从磐石里必有水流出来，使百姓可以喝。”摩西就在以色列的长老眼前这样行了。
{Exo 17:7}  And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, "Is the LORD among us or not?"
{Exo 17:7}  他给那地方起名叫玛撒（就是试探的意思），又叫米利巴（就是争闹的意思）；因以色列人争闹，又因他们试探耶和华，说：“耶和华是在我们中间不是？”
{Exo 17:8}  Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.
{Exo 17:8}  那时，亚玛力人来在利非订，和以色列人争战。
{Exo 17:9}  So Moses said to Joshua, "Choose for us men, and go out and fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand."
{Exo 17:9}  摩西对约书亚说：“你为我们选出人来，出去和亚玛力人争战。明天我手里要拿着神的杖，站在山顶上。”
{Exo 17:10} So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
{Exo 17:10} 于是约书亚照着摩西对他所说的话行，和亚玛力人争战。摩西、亚伦，与户珥都上了山顶。
{Exo 17:11} Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed.
{Exo 17:11} 摩西何时举手，以色列人就得胜，何时垂手，亚玛力人就得胜。
{Exo 17:12} But Moses' hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, while Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side. So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
{Exo 17:12} 但摩西的手发沉，他们就搬石头来，放在他以下，他就坐在上面。亚伦与户珥扶着他的手，一个在这边，一个在那边，他的手就稳住，直到日落的时候。
{Exo 17:13} And Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the sword.
{Exo 17:13} 约书亚用刀杀了亚玛力王和他的百姓。
{Exo 17:14} Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."
{Exo 17:14} 耶和华对摩西说：“我要将亚玛力的名号从天下全然涂抹了；你要将这话写在书上作纪念，又念给约书亚听。”
{Exo 17:15} And Moses built an altar and called the name of it, The LORD Is My Banner,
{Exo 17:15} 摩西筑了一座坛，起名叫“耶和华尼西”（就是耶和华是我旌旗的意思），
{Exo 17:16} saying, "A hand upon the throne of the LORD! The LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."
{Exo 17:16} 又说：“耶和华已经起了誓，必世世代代和亚玛力人争战。”
{Exo 18:1}  Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
{Exo 18:1}  摩西的岳父，米甸祭司叶忒罗，听见神为摩西和神的百姓以色列所行的一切事，就是耶和华将以色列从埃及领出来的事，
{Exo 18:2}  Now Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, had taken Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her home,
{Exo 18:2}  便带着摩西的妻子西坡拉，就是摩西从前打发回去的，
{Exo 18:3}  along with her two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land"),
{Exo 18:3}  又带着西坡拉的两个儿子，一个名叫革舜，因为摩西说：“我在外邦作了寄居的”；
{Exo 18:4}  and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, "The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh").
{Exo 18:4}  一个名叫以利以谢，因为他说：“我父亲的神帮助了我，救我脱离法老的刀。”
{Exo 18:5}  Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God.
{Exo 18:5}  摩西的岳父叶忒罗带着摩西的妻子和两个儿子来到神的山，就是摩西在旷野安营的地方。
{Exo 18:6}  And when he sent word to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her,"
{Exo 18:6}  他对摩西说：“我是你岳父叶忒罗，带着你的妻子和两个儿子来到你这里。”
{Exo 18:7}  Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent.
{Exo 18:7}  摩西迎接他的岳父，向他下拜，与他亲嘴，彼此问安，都进了帐棚。
{Exo 18:8}  Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how the LORD had delivered them.
{Exo 18:8}  摩西将耶和华为以色列的缘故向法老和埃及人所行的一切事，以及路上所遭遇的一切艰难，并耶和华怎样搭救他们，都述说与他岳父听。
{Exo 18:9}  And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
{Exo 18:9}  叶忒罗因耶和华待以色列的一切好处，就是拯救他们脱离埃及人的手，便甚欢喜。
{Exo 18:10} Jethro said, "Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
{Exo 18:10} 叶忒罗说：“耶和华是应当称颂的；他救了你们脱离埃及人和法老的手，将这百姓从埃及人的手下救出来。
{Exo 18:11} Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods, because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people."
{Exo 18:11} 我现今在埃及人向这百姓发狂傲的事上得知，耶和华比万神都大。”
{Exo 18:12} And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
{Exo 18:12} 摩西的岳父叶忒罗把燔祭和平安祭献给神。亚伦和以色列的众长老都来了，与摩西的岳父在神面前吃饭。
{Exo 18:13} The next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening.
{Exo 18:13} 第二天，摩西坐着审判百姓，百姓从早到晚都站在摩西的左右。
{Exo 18:14} When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, "What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?"
{Exo 18:14} 摩西的岳父看见他向百姓所做的一切事，就说：“你向百姓做的是什么事呢？你为什么独自坐着，众百姓从早到晚都站在你的左右呢？”
{Exo 18:15} And Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God;
{Exo 18:15} 摩西对岳父说：“这是因百姓到我这里来求问神。
{Exo 18:16} when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I make them know the statutes of God and his laws."
{Exo 18:16} 他们有事的时候就到我这里来，我便在两造之间施行审判；我又叫他们知道神的律例和法度。”
{Exo 18:17} Moses' father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not good.
{Exo 18:17} 摩西的岳父说：“你这做的不好。
{Exo 18:18} You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone.
{Exo 18:18} 你和这些百姓必都疲惫；因为这事太重，你独自一人办理不了。
{Exo 18:19} Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases to God,
{Exo 18:19} 现在你要听我的话。我为你出个主意，愿神与你同在。你要替百姓到神面前，将案件奏告神；
{Exo 18:20} and you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.
{Exo 18:20} 又要将律例和法度教训他们，指示他们当行的道，当做的事；
{Exo 18:21} Moreover, look for able men from all the people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
{Exo 18:21} 并要从百姓中拣选有才能的人，就是敬畏神、诚实无妄、恨不义之财的人，派他们作千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长，管理百姓，
{Exo 18:22} And let them judge the people at all times. Every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.
{Exo 18:22} 叫他们随时审判百姓，大事都要呈到你这里，小事他们自己可以审判。这样，你就轻省些，他们也可以同当此任。
{Exo 18:23} If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace."
{Exo 18:23} 你若这样行，神也这样吩咐你，你就能受得住，这百姓也都平平安安归回他们的住处。”
{Exo 18:24} So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
{Exo 18:24} 于是，摩西听从他岳父的话，按着他所说的去行。
{Exo 18:25} Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
{Exo 18:25} 摩西从以色列人中拣选了有才能的人，立他们为百姓的首领，作千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长。
{Exo 18:26} And they judged the people at all times. Any hard case they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves.
{Exo 18:26} 他们随时审判百姓，有难断的案件就呈到摩西那里，但各样小事他们自己审判。
{Exo 18:27} Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went away to his own country.
{Exo 18:27} 此后，摩西让他的岳父去，他就往本地去了。
{Exo 19:1}  On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
{Exo 19:1}  以色列人出埃及地以后，满了三个月的那一天，就来到西乃的旷野。
{Exo 19:2}  They set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness. There Israel encamped before the mountain,
{Exo 19:2}  他们离了利非订，来到西乃的旷野，就在那里的山下安营。
{Exo 19:3}  while Moses went up to God. The LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel:
{Exo 19:3}  摩西到神那里，耶和华从山上呼唤他说：“你要这样告诉雅各家，晓谕以色列人说：
{Exo 19:4}  'You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
{Exo 19:4}  ‘我向埃及人所行的事，你们都看见了，且看见我如鹰将你们背在翅膀上，带来归我。
{Exo 19:5}  Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine;
{Exo 19:5}  如今你们若实在听从我的话，遵守我的约，就要在万民中作属我的子民，因为全地都是我的。
{Exo 19:6}  and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel."
{Exo 19:6}  你们要归我作祭司的国度，为圣洁的国民。’这些话你要告诉以色列人。”
{Exo 19:7}  So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him.
{Exo 19:7}  摩西去召了民间的长老来，将耶和华所吩咐他的话都在他们面前陈明。
{Exo 19:8}  All the people answered together and said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do." And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD.
{Exo 19:8}  百姓都同声回答说：“凡耶和华所说的，我们都要遵行。”摩西就将百姓的话回覆耶和华。
{Exo 19:9}  And the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever." When Moses told the words of the people to the LORD,
{Exo 19:9}  耶和华对摩西说：“我要在密云中临到你那里，叫百姓在我与你说话的时候可以听见，也可以永远信你了。”于是，摩西将百姓的话奏告耶和华。
{Exo 19:10} the LORD said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments
{Exo 19:10} 耶和华又对摩西说：“你往百姓那里去，叫他们今天明天自洁，又叫他们洗衣服。
{Exo 19:11} and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
{Exo 19:11} 到第三天要预备好了，因为第三天耶和华要在众百姓眼前降临在西乃山上。
{Exo 19:12} And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, 'Take care not to go up into the mountain or touch the edge of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death.
{Exo 19:12} 你要在山的四围给百姓定界限，说：‘你们当谨慎，不可上山去，也不可摸山的边界；凡摸这山的，必要治死他。
{Exo 19:13} No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; whether beast or man, he shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain."
{Exo 19:13} 不可用手摸他，必用石头打死，或用箭射透；无论是人是牲畜，都不得活。到角声拖长的时候，他们才可到山根来。’”
{Exo 19:14} So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people; and they washed their garments.
{Exo 19:14} 摩西下山往百姓那里去，叫他们自洁，他们就洗衣服。
{Exo 19:15} And he said to the people, "Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman."
{Exo 19:15} 他对百姓说：“到第三天要预备好了。不可亲近女人。”
{Exo 19:16} On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled.
{Exo 19:16} 到了第三天早晨，在山上有雷轰、闪电，和密云，并且角声甚大，营中的百姓尽都发颤。
{Exo 19:17} Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain.
{Exo 19:17} 摩西率领百姓出营迎接神，都站在山下。
{Exo 19:18} Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly.
{Exo 19:18} 西乃全山冒烟，因为耶和华在火中降于山上。山的烟气上腾，如烧窑一般，遍山大大的震动。
{Exo 19:19} And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder.
{Exo 19:19} 角声渐渐地高而又高，摩西就说话，神有声音答应他。
{Exo 19:20} The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
{Exo 19:20} 耶和华降临在西乃山顶上，耶和华召摩西上山顶，摩西就上去。
{Exo 19:21} And the LORD said to Moses, "Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD to look and many of them perish.
{Exo 19:21} 耶和华对摩西说：“你下去嘱咐百姓，不可闯过来到我面前观看，恐怕他们有多人死亡；
{Exo 19:22} Also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, lest the LORD break out against them."
{Exo 19:22} 又叫亲近我的祭司自洁，恐怕我忽然出来击杀他们。”
{Exo 19:23} And Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, 'Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.'"
{Exo 19:23} 摩西对耶和华说：“百姓不能上西乃山，因为你已经嘱咐我们说：‘要在山的四围定界限，叫山成圣。’”
{Exo 19:24} And the LORD said to him, "Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them."
{Exo 19:24} 耶和华对他说：“下去吧，你要和亚伦一同上来；只是祭司和百姓不可闯过来上到我面前，恐怕我忽然出来击杀他们。”
{Exo 19:25} So Moses went down to the people and told them.
{Exo 19:25} 于是摩西下到百姓那里告诉他们。
{Exo 20:1}  And God spoke all these words, saying,
{Exo 20:1}  神吩咐这一切的话说：
{Exo 20:2}  "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
{Exo 20:2}  “我是耶和华你的神，曾将你从埃及地为奴之家领出来。
{Exo 20:3}  "You shall have no other gods before me.
{Exo 20:3}  “除了我以外，你不可有别的神。
{Exo 20:4}  "You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
{Exo 20:4}  “不可为自己雕刻偶像，也不可做什么形像彷佛上天、下地，和地底下、水中的百物。
{Exo 20:5}  You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me,
{Exo 20:5}  不可跪拜那些像，也不可事奉他，因为我耶和华你的神是忌邪的神。恨我的，我必追讨他的罪，自父及子，直到三四代；
{Exo 20:6}  but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
{Exo 20:6}  爱我、守我诫命的，我必向他们发慈爱，直到千代。
{Exo 20:7}  "You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
{Exo 20:7}  “不可妄称耶和华你神的名；因为妄称耶和华名的，耶和华必不以他为无罪。
{Exo 20:8}  "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
{Exo 20:8}  “当记念安息日，守为圣日。
{Exo 20:9}  Six days you shall labor, and do all your work,
{Exo 20:9}  六日要劳碌做你一切的工，
{Exo 20:10} but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates.
{Exo 20:10} 但第七日是向耶和华你神当守的安息日。这一日你和你的儿女、仆婢、牲畜，并你城里寄居的客旅，无论何工都不可做；
{Exo 20:11} For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
{Exo 20:11} 因为六日之内，耶和华造天、地、海，和其中的万物，第七日便安息，所以耶和华赐福与安息日，定为圣日。
{Exo 20:12} "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
{Exo 20:12} “当孝敬父母，使你的日子在耶和华你神所赐你的地上得以长久。
{Exo 20:13} "You shall not murder.
{Exo 20:13} “不可杀人。
{Exo 20:14} "You shall not commit adultery.
{Exo 20:14} “不可奸淫。
{Exo 20:15} "You shall not steal.
{Exo 20:15} “不可偷盗。
{Exo 20:16} "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
{Exo 20:16} “不可作假见证陷害人。
{Exo 20:17} "You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's."
{Exo 20:17} “不可贪恋人的房屋；也不可贪恋人的妻子、仆婢、牛驴，并他一切所有的。”
{Exo 20:18} Now when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, the people were afraid and trembled, and they stood far off
{Exo 20:18} 众百姓见雷轰、闪电、角声、山上冒烟，就都发颤，远远的站立，
{Exo 20:19} and said to Moses, "You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, lest we die."
{Exo 20:19} 对摩西说：“求你和我们说话，我们必听；不要神和我们说话，恐怕我们死亡。”
{Exo 20:20} Moses said to the people, "Do not fear, for God has come to test you, that the fear of him may be before you, that you may not sin."
{Exo 20:20} 摩西对百姓说：“不要惧怕；因为神降临是要试验你们，叫你们时常敬畏他，不至犯罪。”
{Exo 20:21} The people stood far off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
{Exo 20:21} 于是百姓远远的站立；摩西就挨近神所在的幽暗之中。
{Exo 20:22} And the LORD said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the people of Israel: 'You have seen for yourselves that I have talked with you from heaven.
{Exo 20:22} 耶和华对摩西说：“你要向以色列人这样说：‘你们自己看见我从天上和你们说话了。
{Exo 20:23} You shall not make gods of silver to be with me, nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold.
{Exo 20:23} 你们不可做什么神像与我相配，不可为自己做金银的神像。
{Exo 20:24} An altar of earth you shall make for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you.
{Exo 20:24} 你要为我筑土坛，在上面以牛羊献为燔祭和平安祭。凡记下我名的地方，我必到那里赐福给你。
{Exo 20:25} If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones, for if you wield your tool on it you profane it.
{Exo 20:25} 你若为我筑一座石坛，不可用凿成的石头，因你在上头一动家具，就把坛污秽了。
{Exo 20:26} And you shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not exposed on it.'
{Exo 20:26} 你上我的坛，不可用台阶，免得露出你的下体来。’”
{Exo 21:1}  "Now these are the rules that you shall set before them.
{Exo 21:1}  “你在百姓面前所要立的典章是这样：
{Exo 21:2}  When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing.
{Exo 21:2}  你若买希伯来人作奴仆，他必服事你六年；第七年他可以自由，白白地出去。
{Exo 21:3}  If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him.
{Exo 21:3}  他若孤身来就可以孤身去；他若有妻，他的妻就可以同他出去。
{Exo 21:4}  If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out alone.
{Exo 21:4}  他主人若给他妻子，妻子给他生了儿子或女儿，妻子和儿女要归主人，他要独自出去。
{Exo 21:5}  But if the slave plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,'
{Exo 21:5}  倘或奴仆明说：‘我爱我的主人和我的妻子儿女，不愿意自由出去。’
{Exo 21:6}  then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.
{Exo 21:6}  他的主人就要带他到审判官（或作：神；下同）那里，又要带他到门前，靠近门框，用锥子穿他的耳朵，他就永远服事主人。
{Exo 21:7}  "When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.
{Exo 21:7}  “人若卖女儿作婢女，婢女不可像男仆那样出去。
{Exo 21:8}  If she does not please her master, who has designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has broken faith with her.
{Exo 21:8}  主人选定他归自己，若不喜欢他，就要许他赎身；主人既然用诡诈待他，就没有权柄卖给外邦人。
{Exo 21:9}  If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter.
{Exo 21:9}  主人若选定他给自己的儿子，就当待他如同女儿。
{Exo 21:10} If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.
{Exo 21:10} 若另娶一个，那女子的吃食、衣服，并好合的事，仍不可减少。
{Exo 21:11} And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money.
{Exo 21:11} 若不向他行这三样，他就可以不用钱赎，白白地出去。”
{Exo 21:12} "Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall be put to death.
{Exo 21:12} “打人以致打死的，必要把他治死。
{Exo 21:13} But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God let him fall into his hand, then I will appoint for you a place to which he may flee.
{Exo 21:13} 人若不是埋伏着杀人，乃是神交在他手中，我就设下一个地方，他可以往那里逃跑。
{Exo 21:14} But if a man willfully attacks another to kill him by cunning, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.

{Exo 21:17} "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death.
{Exo 21:17} “咒骂父母的，必要把他治死。
{Exo 21:18} "When men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist and the man does not die but takes to his bed,
{Exo 21:18} “人若彼此相争，这个用石头或是拳头打那个，尚且不至于死，不过躺卧在床，
{Exo 21:19} then if the man rises again and walks outdoors with his staff, he who struck him shall be clear; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall have him thoroughly healed.
{Exo 21:19} 若再能起来扶杖而出，那打他的可算无罪；但要将他耽误的工夫用钱赔补，并要将他全然医好。
{Exo 21:20} "When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be avenged.
{Exo 21:20} “人若用棍子打奴仆或婢女，立时死在他的手下，他必要受刑。
{Exo 21:21} But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be avenged, for the slave is his money.
{Exo 21:21} 若过一两天才死，就可以不受刑，因为是用钱买的。
{Exo 21:22} "When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall surely be fined, as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and he shall pay as the judges determine.
{Exo 21:22} “人若彼此争斗，伤害有孕的妇人，甚至坠胎，随后却无别害，那伤害他的，总要按妇人的丈夫所要的，照审判官所断的，受罚。
{Exo 21:23} But if there is harm, then you shall pay life for life,
{Exo 21:23} 若有别害，就要以命偿命，
{Exo 21:24} eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
{Exo 21:24} 以眼还眼，以牙还牙，以手还手，以脚还脚，
{Exo 21:25} burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
{Exo 21:25} 以烙还烙，以伤还伤，以打还打。
{Exo 21:26} "When a man strikes the eye of his slave, male or female, and destroys it, he shall let the slave go free because of his eye.
{Exo 21:26} “人若打坏了他奴仆或是婢女的一只眼，就要因他的眼放他去得以自由。
{Exo 21:27} If he knocks out the tooth of his slave, male or female, he shall let the slave go free because of his tooth.
{Exo 21:27} 若打掉了他奴仆或是婢女的一个牙，就要因他的牙放他去得以自由。”
{Exo 21:28} "When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox shall not be liable.
{Exo 21:28} “牛若触死男人或是女人，总要用石头打死那牛，却不可吃他的肉；牛的主人可算无罪。
{Exo 21:29} But if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.
{Exo 21:29} 倘若那牛素来是触人的，有人报告了牛主，他竟不把牛拴着，以致把男人或是女人触死，就要用石头打死那牛，牛主也必治死。

{Exo 22:8}  若找不到贼，那家主必就近审判官，要看看他拿了原主的物件没有。
{Exo 22:9}  For every breach of trust, whether it is for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a cloak, or for any kind of lost thing, of which one says, 'This is it,' the case of both parties shall come before God. The one whom God condemns shall pay double to his neighbor.

{Exo 32:4}  亚伦从他们手里接过来，铸了一只牛犊，用雕刻的器具做成。他们就说：“以色列啊，这是领你出埃及地的神。”
{Exo 32:5}  When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made a proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD."
{Exo 32:5}  亚伦看见，就在牛犊面前筑坛，且宣告说：“明日要向耶和华守节。”
{Exo 32:6}  And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
{Exo 32:6}  次日清早，百姓起来献燔祭和平安祭，就坐下吃喝，起来玩耍。
{Exo 32:7}  And the LORD said to Moses, "Go down, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
{Exo 32:7}  耶和华吩咐摩西说：“下去吧，因为你的百姓，就是你从埃及地领出来的，已经败坏了。
{Exo 32:8}  They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them. They have made for themselves a golden calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it and said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!'"
{Exo 32:8}  他们快快偏离了我所吩咐的道，为自己铸了一只牛犊，向他下拜献祭，说：‘以色列啊，这就是领你出埃及地的神。’”
{Exo 32:9}  And the LORD said to Moses, "I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
{Exo 32:9}  耶和华对摩西说：“我看这百姓真是硬着颈项的百姓。
{Exo 32:10} Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them, in order that I may make a great nation of you."
{Exo 32:10} 你且由着我，我要向他们发烈怒，将他们灭绝，使你的后裔成为大国。”
{Exo 32:11} But Moses implored the LORD his God and said, "O LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
{Exo 32:11} 摩西便恳求耶和华他的神说：“耶和华啊，你为什么向你的百姓发烈怒呢？这百姓是你用大力和大能的手从埃及地领出来的。
{Exo 32:12} Why should the Egyptians say, 'With evil intent did he bring them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth'? Turn from your burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people.
{Exo 32:12} 为什么使埃及人议论说‘他领他们出去，是要降祸与他们，把他们杀在山中，将他们从地上除灭’？求你转意，不发你的烈怒，后悔，不降祸与你的百姓。
{Exo 32:13} Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, 'I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.'"
{Exo 32:13} 求你记念你的仆人亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列。你曾指着自己起誓说：‘我必使你们的后裔像天上的星那样多，并且我所应许的这全地，必给你们的后裔，他们要永远承受为业。’”
{Exo 32:14} And the LORD relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people.
{Exo 32:14} 于是耶和华后悔，不把所说的祸降与他的百姓。
{Exo 32:15} Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both sides; on the front and on the back they were written.
{Exo 32:15} 摩西转身下山，手里拿着两块法版。这版是两面写的，这面那面都有字，
{Exo 32:16} The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
{Exo 32:16} 是神的工作，字是神写的，刻在版上。
{Exo 32:17} When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a noise of war in the camp."
{Exo 32:17} 约书亚一听见百姓呼喊的声音，就对摩西说：“在营里有争战的声音。”
{Exo 32:18} But he said, "It is not the sound of shouting for victory, or the sound of the cry of defeat, but the sound of singing that I hear."
{Exo 32:18} 摩西说：“这不是人打胜仗的声音，也不是人打败仗的声音，我所听见的乃是人歌唱的声音。”
{Exo 32:19} And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
{Exo 32:19} 摩西挨近营前就看见牛犊，又看见人跳舞，便发烈怒，把两块版扔在山下摔碎了，
{Exo 32:20} He took the calf that they had made and burned it with fire and ground it to powder and scattered it on the water and made the people of Israel drink it.
{Exo 32:20} 又将他们所铸的牛犊用火焚烧，磨得粉碎，撒在水面上，叫以色列人喝。
{Exo 32:21} And Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you that you have brought such a great sin upon them?"
{Exo 32:21} 摩西对亚伦说：“这百姓向你做了什么？你竟使他们陷在大罪里！”
{Exo 32:22} And Aaron said, "Let not the anger of my lord burn hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.
{Exo 32:22} 亚伦说：“求我主不要发烈怒。这百姓专于作恶，是你知道的。
{Exo 32:23} For they said to me, 'Make us gods who shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'
{Exo 32:23} 他们对我说：‘你为我们做神像，可以在我们前面引路；因为领我们出埃及地的那个摩西，我们不知道他遭了什么事。’
{Exo 32:24} So I said to them, 'Let any who have gold take it off.' So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."
{Exo 32:24} 我对他们说：‘凡有金环的可以摘下来’，他们就给了我。我把金环扔在火中，这牛犊便出来了。”
{Exo 32:25} And when Moses saw that the people had broken loose (for Aaron had let them break loose, to the derision of their enemies),
{Exo 32:25} 摩西见百姓放肆（亚伦纵容他们，使他们在仇敌中间被讥刺），
{Exo 32:26} then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, "Who is on the LORD's side? Come to me." And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.
{Exo 32:26} 就站在营门中，说：“凡属耶和华的，都要到我这里来！”于是利未的子孙都到他那里聚集。
{Exo 32:27} And he said to them, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Put your sword on your side each of you, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill his brother and his companion and his neighbor.'"
{Exo 32:27} 他对他们说：“耶和华以色列的神这样说：‘你们各人把刀跨在腰间，在营中往来，从这门到那门，各人杀他的弟兄与同伴并邻舍。’”
{Exo 32:28} And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And that day about three thousand men of the people fell.
{Exo 32:28} 利未的子孙照摩西的话行了。那一天百姓中被杀的约有三千。
{Exo 32:29} And Moses said, "Today you have been ordained for the service of the LORD, each one at the cost of his son and of his brother, so that he might bestow a blessing upon you this day."
{Exo 32:29} 摩西说：“今天你们要自洁，归耶和华为圣，各人攻击他的儿子和弟兄，使耶和华赐福与你们。”
{Exo 32:30} The next day Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
{Exo 32:30} 到了第二天，摩西对百姓说：“你们犯了大罪。我如今要上耶和华那里去，或者可以为你们赎罪。”
{Exo 32:31} So Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Alas, this people has sinned a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold.
{Exo 32:31} 摩西回到耶和华那里，说：“唉！这百姓犯了大罪，为自己做了金像。
{Exo 32:32} But now, if you will forgive their sin--but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written."
{Exo 32:32} 倘或你肯赦免他们的罪，······不然，求你从你所写的册上涂抹我的名。”
{Exo 32:33} But the LORD said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book.
{Exo 32:33} 耶和华对摩西说：“谁得罪我，我就从我的册上涂抹谁的名。
{Exo 32:34} But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them."
{Exo 32:34} 现在你去领这百姓，往我所告诉你的地方去，我的使者必在你前面引路；只是到我追讨的日子，我必追讨他们的罪。”
{Exo 32:35} Then the LORD sent a plague on the people, because they made the calf, the one that Aaron made.
{Exo 32:35} 耶和华杀百姓的缘故是因他们同亚伦做了牛犊。
{Exo 33:1}  The LORD said to Moses, "Depart; go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'To your offspring I will give it.'
{Exo 33:1}  耶和华吩咐摩西说：“我曾起誓应许亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各说：‘要将迦南地赐给你的后裔。’现在你和你从埃及地所领出来的百姓，要从这里往那地去。
{Exo 33:2}  I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
{Exo 33:2}  我要差遣使者在你前面，撵出迦南人、亚摩利人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人，
{Exo 33:3}  Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people."
{Exo 33:3}  领你到那流奶与蜜之地。我自己不同你们上去；因为你们是硬着颈项的百姓，恐怕我在路上把你们灭绝。”
{Exo 33:4}  When the people heard this disastrous word, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments.
{Exo 33:4}  百姓听见这凶信就悲哀，也没有人佩戴妆饰。
{Exo 33:5}  For the LORD had said to Moses, "Say to the people of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people; if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you. So now take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you.'"
{Exo 33:5}  耶和华对摩西说：“你告诉以色列人说：‘耶和华说：你们是硬着颈项的百姓，我若一霎时临到你们中间，必灭绝你们。现在你们要把身上的妆饰摘下来，使我可以知道怎样待你们。’”
{Exo 33:6}  Therefore the people of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.
{Exo 33:6}  以色列人从住何烈山以后，就把身上的妆饰摘得干净。
{Exo 33:7}  Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.
{Exo 33:7}  摩西素常将帐棚支搭在营外，离营却远，他称这帐棚为会幕。凡求问耶和华的，就到营外的会幕那里去。
{Exo 33:8}  Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise up, and each would stand at his tent door, and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent.
{Exo 33:8}  当摩西出营到会幕去的时候，百姓就都起来，各人站在自己帐棚的门口，望着摩西，直等到他进了会幕。
{Exo 33:9}  When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses.
{Exo 33:9}  摩西进会幕的时候，云柱降下来，立在会幕的门前，耶和华便与摩西说话。
{Exo 33:10} And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, each at his tent door.
{Exo 33:10} 众百姓看见云柱立在会幕门前，就都起来，各人在自己帐棚的门口下拜。
{Exo 33:11} Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.
{Exo 33:11} 耶和华与摩西面对面说话，好像人与朋友说话一般。摩西转到营里去，惟有他的帮手，一个少年人嫩的儿子约书亚不离开会幕。
{Exo 33:12} Moses said to the LORD, "See, you say to me, 'Bring up this people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'
{Exo 33:12} 摩西对耶和华说：“你吩咐我说：‘将这百姓领上去’，却没有叫我知道你要打发谁与我同去，只说：‘我按你的名认识你，你在我眼前也蒙了恩。’
{Exo 33:13} Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people."
{Exo 33:13} 我如今若在你眼前蒙恩，求你将你的道指示我，使我可以认识你，好在你眼前蒙恩。求你想到这民是你的民。”
{Exo 33:14} And he said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
{Exo 33:14} 耶和华说：“我必亲自和你同去，使你得安息。”
{Exo 33:15} And he said to him, "If your presence will not go with me, do not bring us up from here.
{Exo 33:15} 摩西说：“你若不亲自和我同去，就不要把我们从这里领上去。
{Exo 33:16} For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Is it not in your going with us, so that we are distinct, I and your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?"
{Exo 33:16} 人在何事上得以知道我和你的百姓在你眼前蒙恩呢？岂不是因你与我们同去、使我和你的百姓与地上的万民有分别吗？”
{Exo 33:17} And the LORD said to Moses, "This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."
{Exo 33:17} 耶和华对摩西说：“你这所求的我也要行；因为你在我眼前蒙了恩，并且我按你的名认识你。”
{Exo 33:18} Moses said, "Please show me your glory."
{Exo 33:18} 摩西说：“求你显出你的荣耀给我看。”
{Exo 33:19} And he said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name 'The LORD.' And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
{Exo 33:19} 耶和华说：“我要显我一切的恩慈，在你面前经过，宣告我的名。我要恩待谁就恩待谁；要怜悯谁就怜悯谁”；
{Exo 33:20} But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live."
{Exo 33:20} 又说：“你不能看见我的面，因为人见我的面不能存活。”
{Exo 33:21} And the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock,
{Exo 33:21} 耶和华说：“看哪，在我这里有地方，你要站在磐石上。
{Exo 33:22} and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
{Exo 33:22} 我的荣耀经过的时候，我必将你放在磐石穴中，用我的手遮掩你，等我过去，
{Exo 33:23} Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen."
{Exo 33:23} 然后我要将我的手收回，你就得见我的背，却不得见我的面。”
{Exo 34:1}  The LORD said to Moses, "Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
{Exo 34:1}  耶和华吩咐摩西说：“你要凿出两块石版，和先前你摔碎的那版一样；其上的字我要写在这版上。
{Exo 34:2}  Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.
{Exo 34:2}  明日早晨，你要预备好了，上西乃山，在山顶上站在我面前。
{Exo 34:3}  No one shall come up with you, and let no one be seen throughout all the mountain. Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain."
{Exo 34:3}  谁也不可和你一同上去，遍山都不可有人，在山根也不可叫羊群牛群吃草。”
{Exo 34:4}  So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first. And he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone.
{Exo 34:4}  摩西就凿出两块石版，和先前的一样。清晨起来，照耶和华所吩咐的上西乃山去，手里拿着两块石版。
{Exo 34:5}  The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
{Exo 34:5}  耶和华在云中降临，和摩西一同站在那里，宣告耶和华的名。
{Exo 34:6}  The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, "The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness,
{Exo 34:6}  耶和华在他面前宣告说：“耶和华，耶和华，是有怜悯有恩典的神，不轻易发怒，并有丰盛的慈爱和诚实，
{Exo 34:7}  keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation."
{Exo 34:7}  为千万人存留慈爱，赦免罪孽、过犯，和罪恶，万不以有罪的为无罪，必追讨他的罪，自父及子，直到三、四代。”
{Exo 34:8}  And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.
{Exo 34:8}  摩西急忙伏地下拜，
{Exo 34:9}  And he said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."
{Exo 34:9}  说：“主啊，我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你在我们中间同行，因为这是硬着颈项的百姓。又求你赦免我们的罪孽和罪恶，以我们为你的产业。”
{Exo 34:10} And he said, "Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been created in all the earth or in any nation. And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD, for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.
{Exo 34:10} 耶和华说：“我要立约，要在百姓面前行奇妙的事，是在遍地万国中所未曾行的。在你四围的外邦人就要看见耶和华的作为，因我向你所行的是可畏惧的事。
{Exo 34:11} "Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
{Exo 34:11} “我今天所吩咐你的，你要谨守。我要从你面前撵出亚摩利人、迦南人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人。
{Exo 34:12} Take care, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you go, lest it become a snare in your midst.
{Exo 34:12} 你要谨慎，不可与你所去那地的居民立约，恐怕成为你们中间的网罗；
{Exo 34:13} You shall tear down their altars and break their pillars and cut down their Asherim
{Exo 34:13} 却要拆毁他们的祭坛，打碎他们的柱像，砍下他们的木偶。
{Exo 34:14} (for you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God),
{Exo 34:14} 不可敬拜别神；因为耶和华是忌邪的神，名为忌邪者。
{Exo 34:15} lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and when they whore after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and you are invited, you eat of his sacrifice,
{Exo 34:15} 只怕你与那地的居民立约，百姓随从他们的神，就行邪淫，祭祀他们的神，有人叫你，你便吃他的祭物，
{Exo 34:16} and you take of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters whore after their gods and make your sons whore after their gods.
{Exo 34:16} 又为你的儿子娶他们的女儿为妻，他们的女儿随从他们的神，就行邪淫，使你的儿子也随从他们的神行邪淫。
{Exo 34:17} "You shall not make for yourself any gods of cast metal.
{Exo 34:17} “不可为自己铸造神像。
{Exo 34:18} "You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.
{Exo 34:18} “你要守除酵节，照我所吩咐你的，在亚笔月内所定的日期吃无酵饼七天，因为你是这亚笔月内出了埃及。
{Exo 34:19} All that open the womb are mine, all your male livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep.
{Exo 34:19} 凡头生的都是我的；一切牲畜头生的，无论是牛是羊，公的都是我的。
{Exo 34:20} The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty-handed.
{Exo 34:20} 头生的驴要用羊羔代赎，若不代赎就要打折他的颈项。凡头生的儿子都要赎出来。谁也不可空手朝见我。”
{Exo 34:21} "Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest. In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.
{Exo 34:21} “你六日要做工，第七日要安息，虽在耕种收割的时候也要安息。
{Exo 34:22} You shall observe the Feast of Weeks, the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year's end.
{Exo 34:22} 在收割初熟麦子的时候要守七七节；又在年底要守收藏节。
{Exo 34:23} Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.
{Exo 34:23} 你们一切男丁要一年三次朝见主耶和华以色列的神。
{Exo 34:24} For I will cast out nations before you and enlarge your borders; no one shall covet your land, when you go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.
{Exo 34:24} 我要从你面前赶出外邦人，扩张你的境界。你一年三次上去朝见耶和华你神的时候，必没有人贪慕你的地土。”
{Exo 34:25} "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened, or let the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover remain until the morning.
{Exo 34:25} “你不可将我祭物的血和有酵的饼一同献上。逾越节的祭物也不可留到早晨。
{Exo 34:26} The best of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk."
{Exo 34:26} 地里首先初熟之物要送到耶和华你神的殿。不可用山羊羔母的奶煮山羊羔。”
{Exo 34:27} And the LORD said to Moses, "Write these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
{Exo 34:27} 耶和华吩咐摩西说：“你要将这些话写上，因为我是按这话与你和以色列人立约。”
{Exo 34:28} So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.
{Exo 34:28} 摩西在耶和华那里四十昼夜，也不吃饭也不喝水。耶和华将这约的话，就是十条诫，写在两块版上。
{Exo 34:29} When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.
{Exo 34:29} 摩西手里拿着两块法版下西乃山的时候，不知道自己的面皮因耶和华和他说话就发了光。
{Exo 34:30} Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
{Exo 34:30} 亚伦和以色列众人看见摩西的面皮发光就怕挨近他。
{Exo 34:31} But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them.
{Exo 34:31} 摩西叫他们来；于是亚伦和会众的官长都到他那里去，摩西就与他们说话。
{Exo 34:32} Afterward all the people of Israel came near, and he commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.
{Exo 34:32} 随后以色列众人都近前来，他就把耶和华在西乃山与他所说的一切话都吩咐他们。
{Exo 34:33} And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
{Exo 34:33} 摩西与他们说完了话就用帕子蒙上脸。
{Exo 34:34} Whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would remove the veil, until he came out. And when he came out and told the people of Israel what he was commanded,
{Exo 34:34} 但摩西进到耶和华面前与他说话就揭去帕子，及至出来的时候便将耶和华所吩咐的告诉以色列人。
{Exo 34:35} the people of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face was shining. And Moses would put the veil over his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
{Exo 34:35} 以色列人看见摩西的面皮发光。摩西又用帕子蒙上脸，等到他进去与耶和华说话就揭去帕子。
{Exo 35:1}  Moses assembled all the congregation of the people of Israel and said to them, "These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do.
{Exo 35:1}  摩西招聚以色列全会众，对他们说：“这是耶和华所吩咐的话，叫你们照着行：
{Exo 35:2}  Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.
{Exo 35:2}  六日要做工，第七日乃为圣日，当向耶和华守为安息圣日。凡这日之内做工的，必把他治死。
{Exo 35:3}  You shall kindle no fire in all your dwelling places on the Sabbath day."
{Exo 35:3}  当安息日，不可在你们一切的住处生火。”
{Exo 35:4}  Moses said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, "This is the thing that the LORD has commanded.
{Exo 35:4}  摩西对以色列全会众说：“耶和华所吩咐的是这样：
{Exo 35:5}  Take from among you a contribution to the LORD. Whoever is of a generous heart, let him bring the LORD's contribution: gold, silver, and bronze;
{Exo 35:5}  你们中间要拿礼物献给耶和华，凡乐意献的可以拿耶和华的礼物来，就是金、银、铜，
{Exo 35:6}  blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen; goats' hair,
{Exo 35:6}  蓝色、紫色、朱红色线，细麻，山羊毛，

{Exo 35:20} Then all the congregation of the people of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
{Exo 35:20} 以色列全会众从摩西面前退去。
{Exo 35:21} And they came, everyone whose heart stirred him, and everyone whose spirit moved him, and brought the LORD's contribution to be used for the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments.
{Exo 35:21} 凡心里受感和甘心乐意的都拿耶和华的礼物来，用以做会幕和其中一切的使用，又用以做圣衣。
{Exo 35:22} So they came, both men and women. All who were of a willing heart brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and armlets, all sorts of gold objects, every man dedicating an offering of gold to the LORD.
{Exo 35:22} 凡心里乐意献礼物的，连男带女，各将金器，就是胸前针、耳环（或作：鼻环）、打印的戒指，和手钏带来献给耶和华。
{Exo 35:23} And every one who possessed blue or purple or scarlet yarns or fine linen or goats' hair or tanned rams' skins or goatskins brought them.

{Exo 35:24} Everyone who could make a contribution of silver or bronze brought it as the LORD's contribution. And every one who possessed acacia wood of any use in the work brought it.
{Exo 35:24} 凡献银子和铜给耶和华为礼物的都拿了来；凡有皂荚木可做什么使用的也拿了来。
{Exo 35:25} And every skillful woman spun with her hands, and they all brought what they had spun in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen.
{Exo 35:25} 凡心中有智慧的妇女亲手纺线，把所纺的蓝色、紫色、朱红色线，和细麻都拿了来。
{Exo 35:26} All the women whose hearts stirred them to use their skill spun the goats' hair.

{Exo 35:28} and spices and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
{Exo 35:28} 又拿香料做香，拿油点灯，做膏油。
{Exo 35:29} All the men and women, the people of Israel, whose heart moved them to bring anything for the work that the LORD had commanded by Moses to be done brought it as a freewill offering to the LORD.
{Exo 35:29} 以色列人，无论男女，凡甘心乐意献礼物给耶和华的，都将礼物拿来，做耶和华藉摩西所吩咐的一切工。
{Exo 35:30} Then Moses said to the people of Israel, "See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
{Exo 35:30} 摩西对以色列人说：“犹大支派中，户珥的孙子、乌利的儿子比撒列，耶和华已经提他的名召他，
{Exo 35:31} and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship,
{Exo 35:31} 又以神的灵充满了他，使他有智慧、聪明、知识，能做各样的工，
{Exo 35:32} to devise artistic designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze,
{Exo 35:32} 能想出巧工，用金、银、铜制造各物，
{Exo 35:33} in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, for work in every skilled craft.
{Exo 35:33} 又能刻宝石，可以镶嵌，能雕刻木头，能做各样的巧工。
{Exo 35:34} And he has inspired him to teach, both him and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan.
{Exo 35:34} 耶和华又使他，和但支派中亚希撒抹的儿子亚何利亚伯，心里灵明，能教导人。
{Exo 35:35} He has filled them with skill to do every sort of work done by an engraver or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, or by a weaver--by any sort of workman or skilled designer.
{Exo 35:35} 耶和华使他们的心满有智慧，能做各样的工，无论是雕刻的工，巧匠的工，用蓝色、紫色、朱红色线，和细麻、绣花的工，并机匠的工，他们都能做，也能想出奇巧的工。
{Exo 36:1}  "Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whom the LORD has put skill and intelligence to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary shall work in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded."
{Exo 36:1}  比撒列和亚何利亚伯，并一切心里有智慧的，就是蒙耶和华赐智慧聪明、叫他知道做圣所各样使用之工的，都要照耶和华所吩咐的做工。”
{Exo 36:2}  And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whose mind the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work.
{Exo 36:2}  凡耶和华赐他心里有智慧、而且受感前来做这工的，摩西把他们和比撒列并亚何利亚伯一同召来。
{Exo 36:3}  And they received from Moses all the contribution that the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning,
{Exo 36:3}  这些人就从摩西收了以色列人为做圣所并圣所使用之工所拿来的礼物。百姓每早晨还把甘心献的礼物拿来。
{Exo 36:4}  so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing,
{Exo 36:4}  凡做圣所一切工的智慧人各都离开他所做的工，
{Exo 36:5}  and said to Moses, "The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do."
{Exo 36:5}  来对摩西说：“百姓为耶和华吩咐使用之工所拿来的，富富有余。”
{Exo 36:6}  So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp, "Let no man or woman do anything more for the contribution for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing,
{Exo 36:6}  摩西传命，他们就在全营中宣告说：“无论男女，不必再为圣所拿什么礼物来。”这样才拦住百姓不再拿礼物来。
{Exo 36:7}  for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more.
{Exo 36:7}  因为他们所有的材料够做一切当做的物，而且有余。
{Exo 36:8}  And all the craftsmen among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains. They were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked.
{Exo 36:8}  他们中间，凡心里有智慧做工的，用十幅幔子做帐幕。这幔子是比撒列用捻的细麻和蓝色、紫色、朱红色线制造的，并用巧匠的手工绣上基路伯。
{Exo 36:9}  The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains were the same size.
{Exo 36:9}  每幅幔子长二十八肘，宽四肘，都是一样的尺寸。
{Exo 36:10} He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another.
{Exo 36:10} 他使这五幅幔子幅幅相连，又使那五幅幔子幅幅相连；
{Exo 36:11} He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set. Likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set.
{Exo 36:11} 在这相连的幔子末幅边上做蓝色的钮扣，在那相连的幔子末幅边上也照样做；
{Exo 36:12} He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set. The loops were opposite one another.
{Exo 36:12} 在这相连的幔子上做五十个钮扣，在那相连的幔子上也做五十个钮扣，都是两两相对；
{Exo 36:13} And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps. So the tabernacle was a single whole.

{Exo 40:36} 每逢云彩从帐幕收上去，以色列人就起程前往；
{Exo 40:37} But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out till the day that it was taken up.
{Exo 40:37} 云彩若不收上去，他们就不起程，直等到云彩收上去。

{Exo 40:38} 日间，耶和华的云彩是在帐幕以上；夜间，云中有火，在以色列全家的眼前。在他们所行的路上都是这样。
