{Jer 1:1}   The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,
{Jer 1:1}   便雅悯地亚拿突城的祭司中，希勒家的儿子耶利米的话记在下面。
{Jer 1:2}   to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
{Jer 1:2}   犹大王亚们的儿子约西亚在位十三年，耶和华的话临到耶利米。
{Jer 1:3}   It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
{Jer 1:3}   从犹大王约西亚的儿子约雅敬在位的时候，直到犹大王约西亚的儿子西底家在位的末年，就是十一年五月间耶路撒冷人被掳的时候，耶和华的话也常临到耶利米。
{Jer 1:4}   Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
{Jer 1:4}   耶利米说，耶和华的话临到我说：
{Jer 1:5}   "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations."
{Jer 1:5}   我未将你造在腹中，我已晓得你；你未出母胎，我已分别你为圣；我已派你作列国的先知。
{Jer 1:6}   Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth."
{Jer 1:6}   我就说：主耶和华啊，我不知怎样说，因为我是年幼的。
{Jer 1:7}   But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am only a youth'; for to all to whom I send you, you shall go, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.
{Jer 1:7}   耶和华对我说：你不要说我是年幼的，因为我差遣你到谁那里去，你都要去；我吩咐你说什么话，你都要说。
{Jer 1:8}   Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, declares the LORD."
{Jer 1:8}   你不要惧怕他们，因为我与你同在，要拯救你。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 1:9}   Then the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.
{Jer 1:9}   于是耶和华伸手按我的口，对我说：我已将当说的话传给你。
{Jer 1:10}  See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."
{Jer 1:10}  看哪，我今日立你在列邦列国之上，为要施行拔出、拆毁、毁坏、倾覆，又要建立、栽植。
{Jer 1:11}  And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" And I said, "I see an almond branch."
{Jer 1:11}  耶和华的话又临到我说：“耶利米，你看见什么？”我说：“我看见一根杏树枝。”
{Jer 1:12}  Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it."
{Jer 1:12}  耶和华对我说：“你看得不错；因为我留意保守我的话，使得成就。”
{Jer 1:13}  The word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north."
{Jer 1:13}  耶和华的话第二次临到我说：“你看见什么？”我说：“我看见一个烧开的锅，从北而倾。”
{Jer 1:14}  Then the LORD said to me, "Out of the north disaster shall be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land.
{Jer 1:14}  耶和华对我说：“必有灾祸从北方发出，临到这地的一切居民。”
{Jer 1:15}  For behold, I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, declares the LORD, and they shall come, and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls all around and against all the cities of Judah.
{Jer 1:15}  耶和华说：“看哪，我要召北方列国的众族；他们要来，各安座位在耶路撒冷的城门口，周围攻击城墙，又要攻击犹大的一切城邑。
{Jer 1:16}  And I will declare my judgments against them, for all their evil in forsaking me. They have made offerings to other gods and worshiped the works of their own hands.
{Jer 1:16}  至于这民的一切恶，就是离弃我、向别神烧香、跪拜自己手所造的，我要发出我的判语，攻击他们。
{Jer 1:17}  But you, dress yourself for work; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them.
{Jer 1:17}  所以你当束腰，起来将我所吩咐你的一切话告诉他们；不要因他们惊惶，免得我使你在他们面前惊惶。
{Jer 1:18}  And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
{Jer 1:18}  看哪，我今日使你成为坚城、铁柱、铜墙，与全地和犹大的君王、首领、祭司，并地上的众民反对。
{Jer 1:19}  They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, declares the LORD, to deliver you."
{Jer 1:19}  他们要攻击你，却不能胜你；因为我与你同在，要拯救你。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 2:1}   The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
{Jer 2:1}   耶和华的话临到我说：
{Jer 2:2}   "Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD, "I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.
{Jer 2:2}   “你去向耶路撒冷人的耳中喊叫说，耶和华如此说：你幼年的恩爱，婚姻的爱情，你怎样在旷野，在未曾耕种之地跟随我，我都记得。
{Jer 2:3}   Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of his harvest. All who ate of it incurred guilt; disaster came upon them, declares the LORD."
{Jer 2:3}   那时以色列归耶和华为圣，作为土产初熟的果子；凡吞吃他的必算为有罪，灾祸必临到他们。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 2:4}   Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel.
{Jer 2:4}   雅各家、以色列家的各族啊，你们当听耶和华的话。
{Jer 2:5}   Thus says the LORD: "What wrong did your fathers find in me that they went far from me, and went after worthlessness, and became worthless?
{Jer 2:5}   耶和华如此说：你们的列祖见我有什么不义，竟远离我，随从虚无的神，自己成为虚妄的呢？
{Jer 2:6}   They did not say, 'Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt, who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits, in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that none passes through, where no man dwells?'
{Jer 2:6}   他们也不说：那领我们从埃及地上来，引导我们经过旷野，沙漠有深坑之地，和干旱死荫，无人经过，无人居住之地的耶和华在哪里呢·
{Jer 2:7}   And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and its good things. But when you came in, you defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination.
{Jer 2:7}   我领你们进入肥美之地，使你们得吃其中的果子和美物；但你们进入的时候就玷污我的地，使我的产业成为可憎的。
{Jer 2:8}   The priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?' Those who handle the law did not know me; the shepherds transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after things that do not profit.
{Jer 2:8}   祭司都不说，耶和华在那里呢？传讲律法的都不认识我。官长违背我；先知藉巴力说预言，随从无益的神。
{Jer 2:9}   "Therefore I still contend with you, declares the LORD, and with your children's children I will contend.
{Jer 2:9}   耶和华说：我因此必与你们争辩，也必与你们的子孙争辩。
{Jer 2:10}  For cross to the coasts of Cyprus and see, or send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has been such a thing.
{Jer 2:10}  你们且过到基提海岛去察看，打发人往基达去留心查考，看曾有这样的事没有。
{Jer 2:11}  Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
{Jer 2:11}  岂有一国换了他的神吗？其实这不是神！但我的百姓将他们的荣耀换了那无益的神。
{Jer 2:12}  Be appalled, O heavens, at this; be shocked, be utterly desolate, declares the LORD,
{Jer 2:12}  诸天哪，要因此惊奇，极其恐慌，甚为凄凉！这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 2:13}  for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.
{Jer 2:13}  因为我的百姓做了两件恶事，就是离弃我这活水的泉源，为自己凿出池子，是破裂不能存水的池子。
{Jer 2:14}  "Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant? Why then has he become a prey?
{Jer 2:14}  以色列是仆人吗？是家中生的奴仆吗？为何成为掠物呢？

{Jer 2:17}  Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the LORD your God, when he led you in the way?
{Jer 2:17}  这事临到你身上，不是你自招的吗？不是因耶和华你神引你行路的时候，你离弃他吗？
{Jer 2:18}  And now what do you gain by going to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile? Or what do you gain by going to Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
{Jer 2:18}  现今你为何在埃及路上要喝西曷的水呢？你为何在亚述路上要喝大河的水呢？
{Jer 2:19}  Your evil will chastise you, and your apostasy will reprove you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the LORD your God; the fear of me is not in you, declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
{Jer 2:19}  你自己的恶必惩治你；你背道的事必责备你。由此可知可见，你离弃耶和华你的} 神，不存敬畏我的心，乃为恶事，为苦事·这是主万军之耶和华说的。
{Jer 2:20}  "For long ago I broke your yoke and burst your bonds; but you said, 'I will not serve.' Yes, on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed down like a whore.
{Jer 2:20}  我在古时折断你的轭，解开你的绳索。你说：我必不事奉耶和华；因为你在各高冈上、各青翠树下屈身行淫（或作：我在古时折断你的轭，解开你的绳索，你就说：我必不事奉别神。谁知你在各高冈上、各青翠树下仍屈身行淫）。
{Jer 2:21}  Yet I planted you a choice vine, wholly of pure seed. How then have you turned degenerate and become a wild vine?
{Jer 2:21}  然而，我栽你是上等的葡萄树，全然是真种子；你怎么向我变为外邦葡萄树的坏枝子呢？
{Jer 2:22}  Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me, declares the Lord GOD.
{Jer 2:22}  你虽用硷、多用肥皂洗濯，你罪孽的痕迹仍然在我面前显出。这是主耶和华说的。
{Jer 2:23}  How can you say, 'I am not unclean, I have not gone after the Baals'? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done-- a restless young camel running here and there,
{Jer 2:23}  你怎能说：我没有玷污、没有随从众巴力？你看你谷中的路，就知道你所行的如何。你是快行的独峰驼，狂奔乱走。
{Jer 2:24}  a wild donkey used to the wilderness, in her heat sniffing the wind! Who can restrain her lust? None who seek her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her.
{Jer 2:24}  你是野驴，惯在旷野，欲心发动就吸风；起性的时候谁能使他转去呢？凡寻找他的必不至疲乏；在他的月分必能寻见。
{Jer 2:25}  Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, 'It is hopeless, for I have loved foreigners, and after them I will go.'
{Jer 2:25}  我说：你不要使脚上无鞋，喉咙干渴。你倒说：这是枉然。我喜爱别神，我必随从他们。
{Jer 2:26}  "As a thief is shamed when caught, so the house of Israel shall be shamed: they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets,
{Jer 2:26}  贼被捉拿，怎样羞愧，以色列家和他们的君王、首领、祭司、先知也都照样羞愧。
{Jer 2:27}  who say to a tree, 'You are my father,' and to a stone, 'You gave me birth.' For they have turned their back to me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they say, 'Arise and save us!'
{Jer 2:27}  他们向木头说：你是我的父；向石头说：你是生我的。他们以背向我，不以面向我；及至遭遇患难的时候却说：起来拯救我们。
{Jer 2:28}  But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you, in your time of trouble; for as many as your cities are your gods, O Judah.
{Jer 2:28}  你为自己做的神在那里呢？你遭遇患难的时候，叫他们起来拯救你吧！犹大啊，你神的数目与你城的数目相等。
{Jer 2:29}  "Why do you contend with me? You have all transgressed against me, declares the LORD.
{Jer 2:29}  耶和华说：你们为何与我争辩呢？你们都违背了我。
{Jer 2:30}  In vain have I struck your children; they took no correction; your own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.
{Jer 2:30}  我责打你们的儿女是徒然的，他们不受惩治。你们自己的刀吞灭你们的先知，好像残害的狮子。
{Jer 2:31}  And you, O generation, behold the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why then do my people say, 'We are free, we will come no more to you'?
{Jer 2:31}  这世代的人哪，你们要看明耶和华的话。我岂向以色列作旷野呢？或作幽暗之地呢？我的百姓为何说：我们脱离约束，再不归向你了？
{Jer 2:32}  Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
{Jer 2:32}  处女岂能忘记他的妆饰呢？新妇岂能忘记他的美衣呢？我的百姓却忘记了我无数的日子！
{Jer 2:33}  "How well you direct your course to seek love! So that even to wicked women you have taught your ways.
{Jer 2:33}  你怎么修饰你的道路要求爱情呢？就是恶劣的妇人你也叫他们行你的路。
{Jer 2:34}  Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the guiltless poor; you did not find them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things
{Jer 2:34}  并且你的衣襟上有无辜穷人的血；你杀他们并不是遇见他们挖窟窿，乃是因这一切的事。
{Jer 2:35}  you say, 'I am innocent; surely his anger has turned from me.' Behold, I will bring you to judgment for saying, 'I have not sinned.'
{Jer 2:35}  你还说：我无辜；耶和华的怒气必定向我消了。看哪，我必审问你；因你自说：我没有犯罪。
{Jer 2:36}  How much you go about, changing your way! You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.
{Jer 2:36}  你为何东跑西奔要更换你的路呢？你必因埃及蒙羞，像从前因亚述蒙羞一样。
{Jer 2:37}  From it too you will come away with your hands on your head, for the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.
{Jer 2:37}  你也必两手抱头从埃及出来；因为耶和华已经弃绝你所倚靠的，你必不因他们得顺利。
{Jer 3:1}   "If a man divorces his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's wife, will he return to her? Would not that land be greatly polluted? You have played the whore with many lovers; and would you return to me? declares the LORD.
{Jer 3:1}   有话说：人若休妻，妻离他而去，作了别人的妻，前夫岂能再收回他来？若收回他来，那地岂不是大大玷污了吗？但你和许多亲爱的行邪淫，还可以归向我。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 3:2}   Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been ravished? By the waysides you have sat awaiting lovers like an Arab in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your vile whoredom.
{Jer 3:2}   你向净光的高处举目观看，你在何处没有淫行呢？你坐在道旁等候，好像亚拉伯人在旷野埋伏一样，并且你的淫行邪恶玷污了全地。
{Jer 3:3}   Therefore the showers have been withheld, and the spring rain has not come; yet you have the forehead of a whore; you refuse to be ashamed.
{Jer 3:3}   因此甘霖停止，春（原文作晚）雨不降。你还是有娼妓之脸，不顾羞耻。
{Jer 3:4}   Have you not just now called to me, 'My father, you are the friend of my youth--
{Jer 3:4}   从今以后，你岂不向我呼叫说：我父啊，你是我幼年的恩主。
{Jer 3:5}   will he be angry forever, will he be indignant to the end?' Behold, you have spoken, but you have done all the evil that you could."
{Jer 3:5}   耶和华岂永远怀怒，存留到底吗？看哪，你又发恶言又行坏事，随自己的私意而行（或作：你虽这样说，还是行恶放纵欲心）。
{Jer 3:6}   The LORD said to me in the days of King Josiah: "Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and there played the whore?
{Jer 3:6}   约西亚王在位的时候，耶和华又对我说：“背道的以色列所行的，你看见没有？他上各高山，在各青翠树下行淫。
{Jer 3:7}   And I thought, 'After she has done all this she will return to me,' but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
{Jer 3:7}   他行这些事以后，我说他必归向我，他却不归向我。他奸诈的妹妹犹大也看见了。
{Jer 3:8}   She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had sent her away with a decree of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she too went and played the whore.
{Jer 3:8}   背道的以色列行淫，我为这缘故给他休书休他；我看见他奸诈的妹妹犹大，还不惧怕，也去行淫。
{Jer 3:9}   Because she took her whoredom lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and tree.
{Jer 3:9}   因以色列轻忽了他的淫乱，和石头木头行淫，地就被玷污了。
{Jer 3:10}  Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart, but in pretense, declares the LORD."
{Jer 3:10}  虽有这一切的事，他奸诈的妹妹犹大还不一心归向我，不过是假意归我。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 3:11}  And the LORD said to me, "Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
{Jer 3:11}  耶和华对我说：“背道的以色列比奸诈的犹大还显为义。

{Jer 3:16}  And when you have multiplied and been fruitful in the land, in those days, declares the LORD, they shall no more say, "The ark of the covenant of the LORD." It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed; it shall not be made again.
{Jer 3:16}  耶和华说：“你们在国中生养众多；当那些日子，人必不再提说耶和华的约柜，不追想，不记念，不觉缺少，也不再制造。
{Jer 3:17}  At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the LORD, and all nations shall gather to it, to the presence of the LORD in Jerusalem, and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart.
{Jer 3:17}  那时，人必称耶路撒冷为耶和华的宝座；万国必到耶路撒冷，在耶和华立名的地方聚集。他们必不再随从自己顽梗的恶心行事。

{Jer 3:20}  Surely, as a treacherous wife leaves her husband, so have you been treacherous to me, O house of Israel, declares the LORD.'"
{Jer 3:20}  以色列家，你们向我行诡诈，真像妻子行诡诈离开他丈夫一样。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 3:21}  A voice on the bare heights is heard, the weeping and pleading of Israel's sons because they have perverted their way; they have forgotten the LORD their God.
{Jer 3:21}  在净光的高处听见人声，就是以色列人哭泣恳求之声，乃因他们走弯曲之道，忘记耶和华他们的神。

{Jer 3:23}  仰望从小山或从大山的喧嚷中得帮助，真是枉然的。以色列得救，诚然在乎耶和华我们的神。
{Jer 3:24}  "But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
{Jer 3:24}  从我们幼年以来，那可耻的偶像将我们列祖所劳碌得来的羊群、牛群，和他们的儿女都吞吃了。
{Jer 3:25}  Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us. For we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."
{Jer 3:25}  我们在羞耻中躺卧吧！愿惭愧将我们遮盖；因为从立国（原文作幼年）以来，我们和我们的列祖常常得罪耶和华我们的神，没有听从耶和华我们神的话。
{Jer 4:1}   "If you return, O Israel, declares the LORD, to me you should return. If you remove your detestable things from my presence, and do not waver,
{Jer 4:1}   耶和华说：以色列啊，你若回来归向我，若从我眼前除掉你可憎的偶像，你就不被迁移。
{Jer 4:2}   and if you swear, 'As the LORD lives,' in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory."
{Jer 4:2}   你必凭诚实、公平、公义，指着永生的耶和华起誓；列国必因耶和华称自己为有福，也必因他夸耀。
{Jer 4:3}   For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: "Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.

{Jer 4:8}   For this put on sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned back from us."
{Jer 4:8}   因此，你们当腰束麻布，大声哀号，因为耶和华的烈怒没有向我们转消。
{Jer 4:9}   "In that day, declares the LORD, courage shall fail both king and officials. The priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded."

{Jer 4:10}  Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD, surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'It shall be well with you,' whereas the sword has reached their very life."
{Jer 4:10}  我说：“哀哉！主耶和华啊，你真是大大的欺哄这百姓和耶路撒冷，说：‘你们必得平安。’其实刀剑害及性命了。”
{Jer 4:11}  At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A hot wind from the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse,
{Jer 4:11}  那时，必有话对这百姓和耶路撒冷说：“有一阵热风从旷野净光的高处向我的众民（原文作民女）刮来，不是为簸扬，也不是为扬净。
{Jer 4:12}  a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who speak in judgment upon them."
{Jer 4:12}  必有一阵更大的风从这些地方为我刮来；现在我又必发出判语，攻击他们。”
{Jer 4:13}  Behold, he comes up like clouds; his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles-- woe to us, for we are ruined!
{Jer 4:13}  看哪，仇敌必如云上来；他的战车如旋风，他的马匹比鹰更快。我们有祸了！我们败落了！
{Jer 4:14}  O Jerusalem, wash your heart from evil, that you may be saved. How long shall your wicked thoughts lodge within you?
{Jer 4:14}  耶路撒冷啊，你当洗去心中的恶，使你可以得救。恶念存在你心里要到几时呢？
{Jer 4:15}  For a voice declares from Dan and proclaims trouble from Mount Ephraim.
{Jer 4:15}  有声音从但传扬，从以法莲山报祸患。

{Jer 4:18}  Your ways and your deeds have brought this upon you. This is your doom, and it is bitter; it has reached your very heart."
{Jer 4:18}  你的行动，你的作为，招惹这事；这是你罪恶的结果，实在是苦，是害及你心了！

{Jer 4:19}  我的肺腑啊，我的肺腑啊，我心疼痛！我心在我里面烦躁不安。我不能静默不言，因为我已经听见角声和打仗的喊声。
{Jer 4:20}  Crash follows hard on crash; the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are laid waste, my curtains in a moment.
{Jer 4:20}  毁坏的信息连络不绝，因为全地荒废。我的帐棚忽然毁坏；我的幔子顷刻破裂。
{Jer 4:21}  How long must I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
{Jer 4:21}  我看见大旗，听见角声，要到几时呢？
{Jer 4:22}  "For my people are foolish; they know me not; they are stupid children; they have no understanding. They are 'wise'--in doing evil! But how to do good they know not."
{Jer 4:22}  耶和华说：我的百性愚顽，不认识我；他们是愚昧无知的儿女，有智慧行恶，没有知识行善。
{Jer 4:23}  I looked on the earth, and behold, it was without form and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.
{Jer 4:23}  先知说：我观看地，不料，地是空虚混沌；我观看天，天也无光。

{Jer 4:27}  耶和华如此说：全地必然荒凉，我却不毁灭净尽。
{Jer 4:28}  "For this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above be dark; for I have spoken; I have purposed; I have not relented, nor will I turn back."

{Jer 4:29}  At the noise of horseman and archer every city takes to flight; they enter thickets; they climb among rocks; all the cities are forsaken, and no man dwells in them.
{Jer 4:29}  各城的人因马兵和弓箭手的响声就都逃跑，进入密林，爬上磐石；各城被撇下，无人住在其中。

{Jer 4:30}  你凄凉的时候要怎样行呢？你虽穿上朱红衣服，佩戴黄金装饰，用颜料修饰眼目，这样标致是枉然的！恋爱你的藐视你，并且寻索你的性命。

{Jer 4:31}  我听见有声音，彷佛妇人产难的声音，好像生头胎疼痛的声音，是锡安女子（就是指民的意思）的声音；他喘着气、挓挲手，说：我有祸了！在杀人的跟前，我的心发昏了。

{Jer 5:1}   你们当在耶路撒冷的街上跑来跑去，在宽阔处寻找，看看有一人行公义求诚实没有？若有，我就赦免这城。
{Jer 5:2}   Though they say, "As the LORD lives," yet they swear falsely.
{Jer 5:2}   其中的人虽然指着永生的耶和华起誓，所起的誓实在是假的。
{Jer 5:3}   O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You have struck them down, but they felt no anguish; you have consumed them, but they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to repent.
{Jer 5:3}   耶和华啊，你的眼目不是看顾诚实吗？你击打他们，他们却不伤恸；你毁灭他们，他们仍不受惩治。他们使脸刚硬过于磐石，不肯回头。
{Jer 5:4}   Then I said, "These are only the poor; they have no sense; for they do not know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God.
{Jer 5:4}   我说：这些人实在是贫穷的，是愚昧的，因为不晓得耶和华的作为和他们神的法则。

{Jer 5:5}   我要去见尊大的人，对他们说话，因为他们晓得耶和华的作为和他们神的法则。哪知，这些人齐心将轭折断，挣开绳索。
{Jer 5:6}   Therefore a lion from the forest shall strike them down; a wolf from the desert shall devastate them. A leopard is watching their cities; everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many, their apostasies are great.
{Jer 5:6}   因此，林中的狮子必害死他们；晚上（或作：野地）的豺狼必灭绝他们；豹子要在城外窥伺他们。凡出城的必被撕碎；因为他们的罪过极多，背道的事也加增了。
{Jer 5:7}   "How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me and have sworn by those who are no gods. When I fed them to the full, they committed adultery and trooped to the houses of whores.
{Jer 5:7}   我怎能赦免你呢？你的儿女离弃我，又指着那不是神的起誓。我使他们饱足，他们就行奸淫，成群地聚集在娼妓家里。
{Jer 5:8}   They were well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for his neighbor's wife.

{Jer 5:16}  他们的箭袋是敞开的坟墓；他们都是勇士。
{Jer 5:17}  They shall eat up your harvest and your food; they shall eat up your sons and your daughters; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; your fortified cities in which you trust they shall beat down with the sword."
{Jer 5:17}  他们必吃尽你的庄稼和你的粮食，是你儿女该吃的；必吃尽你的牛羊，吃尽你的葡萄和无花果；又必用刀毁坏你所倚靠的坚固城。
{Jer 5:18}  "But even in those days, declares the LORD, I will not make a full end of you.
{Jer 5:18}  耶和华说：“就是到那时，我也不将你们毁灭净尽。
{Jer 5:19}  And when your people say, 'Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?' you shall say to them, 'As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve foreigners in a land that is not yours.'"
{Jer 5:19}  百姓若说：‘耶和华我们的神为什么向我们行这一切事呢？’你就对他们说：‘你们怎样离弃耶和华（原文作我），在你们的地上事奉外邦神，也必照样在不属你们的地上事奉外邦人。’”
{Jer 5:20}  Declare this in the house of Jacob; proclaim it in Judah:
{Jer 5:20}  当传扬在雅各家，报告在犹大说：
{Jer 5:21}  "Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes, but see not, who have ears, but hear not.
{Jer 5:21}  愚昧无知的百姓啊，你们有眼不看，有耳不听，现在当听这话。

{Jer 5:22}  耶和华说：你们怎么不惧怕我呢？我以永远的定例，用沙为海的界限，水不得越过。因此，你们在我面前还不战兢吗？波浪虽然翻腾，却不能逾越；虽然砰訇，却不能过去。

{Jer 5:25}  你们的罪孽使这些事转离你们；你们的罪恶使你们不能得福。

{Jer 5:30}  国中有可惊骇、可憎恶的事：

{Jer 6:10}  To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, they cannot listen; behold, the word of the LORD is to them an object of scorn; they take no pleasure in it.
{Jer 6:10}  现在我可以向谁说话作见证，使他们听呢？他们的耳朵未受割礼，不能听见。看哪，耶和华的话他们以为羞辱，不以为喜悦。
{Jer 6:11}  Therefore I am full of the wrath of the LORD; I am weary of holding it in. "Pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the gatherings of young men, also; both husband and wife shall be taken, the elderly and the very aged.

{Jer 7:5}   “你们若实在改正行动作为，在人和邻舍中间诚然施行公平，
{Jer 7:6}   if you do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own harm,
{Jer 7:6}   不欺压寄居的和孤儿寡妇；在这地方不流无辜人的血，也不随从别神陷害自己；

{Jer 7:13}  And now, because you have done all these things, declares the LORD, and when I spoke to you persistently you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer,
{Jer 7:13}  耶和华说：“现在因你们行了这一切的事，我也从早起来警戒你们，你们却不听从；呼唤你们，你们却不答应。
{Jer 7:14}  therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, and in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
{Jer 7:14}  所以我要向这称我为名下、你们所倚靠的殿，与我所赐给你们和你们列祖的地施行，照我从前向示罗所行的一样。
{Jer 7:15}  And I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the offspring of Ephraim.
{Jer 7:15}  我必将你们从我眼前赶出，正如赶出你们的众弟兄，就是以法莲的一切后裔。”
{Jer 7:16}  "As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you.
{Jer 7:16}  “所以，你不要为这百姓祈祷；不要为他们呼求祷告，也不要向我为他们祈求，因我不听允你。
{Jer 7:17}  Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
{Jer 7:17}  他们在犹大城邑中和耶路撒冷街上所行的，你没有看见吗？
{Jer 7:18}  The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven. And they pour out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
{Jer 7:18}  孩子捡柴，父亲烧火，妇女抟面做饼，献给天后，又向别神浇奠祭，惹我发怒。”
{Jer 7:19}  Is it I whom they provoke? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves, to their own shame?
{Jer 7:19}  耶和华说：“他们岂是惹我发怒呢？不是自己惹祸，以致脸上惭愧吗？”
{Jer 7:20}  Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, upon man and beast, upon the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; it will burn and not be quenched."
{Jer 7:20}  所以主耶和华如此说：“看哪，我必将我的怒气和忿怒倾在这地方的人和牲畜身上，并田野的树木和地里的出产上，必如火着起，不能熄灭。”
{Jer 7:21}  Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh.
{Jer 7:21}  万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：“你们将燔祭加在平安祭上，吃肉吧！
{Jer 7:22}  For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.
{Jer 7:22}  因为我将你们列祖从埃及地领出来的那日，燔祭平安祭的事我并没有提说，也没有吩咐他们。
{Jer 7:23}  But this command I gave them: 'Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. And walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.'
{Jer 7:23}  我只吩咐他们这一件说：‘你们当听从我的话，我就作你们的神，你们也作我的子民。你们行我所吩咐的一切道，就可以得福。’
{Jer 7:24}  But they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and went backward and not forward.
{Jer 7:24}  他们却不听从，不侧耳而听，竟随从自己的计谋和顽梗的恶心，向后不向前。
{Jer 7:25}  From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day.
{Jer 7:25}  自从你们列祖出埃及地的那日，直到今日，我差遣我的仆人众先知到你们那里去，每日从早起来差遣他们。
{Jer 7:26}  Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.
{Jer 7:26}  你们却不听从，不侧耳而听，竟硬着颈项行恶，比你们列祖更甚。
{Jer 7:27}  "So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall call to them, but they will not answer you.
{Jer 7:27}  “你要将这一切的话告诉他们，他们却不听从；呼唤他们，他们却不答应。
{Jer 7:28}  And you shall say to them, 'This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, and did not accept discipline; truth has perished; it is cut off from their lips.
{Jer 7:28}  你要对他们说：这就是不听从耶和华他们神的话、不受教训的国民；从他们的口中，诚实灭绝了。”
{Jer 7:29}  "'Cut off your hair and cast it away; raise a lamentation on the bare heights, for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.'
{Jer 7:29}  耶路撒冷啊，要剪发抛弃，在净光的高处举哀；因为耶和华丢掉离弃了惹他忿怒的世代。
{Jer 7:30}  "For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, declares the LORD. They have set their detestable things in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.
{Jer 7:30}  耶和华说：“犹大人行我眼中看为恶的事，将可憎之物设立在称为我名下的殿中，污秽这殿。
{Jer 7:31}  And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind.
{Jer 7:31}  他们在欣嫩子谷建筑陀斐特的邱坛，好在火中焚烧自己的儿女。这并不是我所吩咐的，也不是我心所起的意。”
{Jer 7:32}  Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it will no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth, because there is no room elsewhere.
{Jer 7:32}  耶和华说：“因此，日子将到，这地方不再称为陀斐特和欣嫩子谷，反倒称为杀戮谷。因为要在陀斐特葬埋尸首，甚至无处可葬；
{Jer 7:33}  And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, and none will frighten them away.
{Jer 7:33}  并且这百姓的尸首必给空中的飞鸟和地上的野兽作食物，并无人哄赶。
{Jer 7:34}  And I will silence in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land shall become a waste.
{Jer 7:34}  那时，我必使犹大城邑中和耶路撒冷街上，欢喜和快乐的声音，新郎和新妇的声音，都止息了，因为地必成为荒场。”
{Jer 8:1}   "At that time, declares the LORD, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be brought out of their tombs.
{Jer 8:1}   耶和华说：“到那时，人必将犹大王的骸骨和他首领的骸骨、祭司的骸骨、先知的骸骨，并耶路撒冷居民的骸骨，都从坟墓中取出来，
{Jer 8:2}   And they shall be spread before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, which they have gone after, and which they have sought and worshiped. And they shall not be gathered or buried. They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground.
{Jer 8:2}   抛散在日头、月亮，和天上众星之下，就是他们从前所喜爱、所事奉、所随从、所求问、所敬拜的。这些骸骨不再收殓，不再葬埋，必在地面上成为粪土；
{Jer 8:3}   Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family in all the places where I have driven them, declares the LORD of hosts.
{Jer 8:3}   并且这恶族所剩下的民在我所赶他们到的各处，宁可拣死不拣生。这是万军之耶和华说的。”
{Jer 8:4}   "You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD: When men fall, do they not rise again? If one turns away, does he not return?
{Jer 8:4}   你要对他们说，耶和华如此说：人跌倒，不再起来吗？人转去，不再转来吗？
{Jer 8:5}   Why then has this people turned away in perpetual backsliding? They hold fast to deceit; they refuse to return.
{Jer 8:5}   这耶路撒冷的民，为何恒久背道呢？他们守定诡诈，不肯回头。
{Jer 8:6}   I have paid attention and listened, but they have not spoken rightly; no man relents of his evil, saying, 'What have I done?' Everyone turns to his own course, like a horse plunging headlong into battle.
{Jer 8:6}   我留心听，听见他们说不正直的话。无人悔改恶行，说：我做的是什么呢？他们各人转奔己路，如马直闯战场。
{Jer 8:7}   Even the stork in the heavens knows her times, and the turtledove, swallow, and crane keep the time of their coming, but my people know not the rules of the LORD.
{Jer 8:7}   空中的鹳鸟知道来去的定期；斑鸠燕子与白鹤也守候当来的时令；我的百姓却不知道耶和华的法则。
{Jer 8:8}   "How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us'? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.
{Jer 8:8}   你们怎么说：我们有智慧，耶和华的律法在我们这里？看哪，文士的假笔舞弄虚假。
{Jer 8:9}   The wise men shall be put to shame; they shall be dismayed and taken; behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, so what wisdom is in them?
{Jer 8:9}   智慧人惭愧，惊惶，被擒拿；他们弃掉耶和华的话，心里还有什么智慧呢？
{Jer 8:10}  Therefore I will give their wives to others and their fields to conquerors, because from the least to the greatest everyone is greedy for unjust gain; from prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
{Jer 8:10}  所以我必将他们的妻子给别人，将他们的田地给别人为业；因为他们从最小的到至大的都一味地贪婪，从先知到祭司都行事虚谎。
{Jer 8:11}  They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.
{Jer 8:11}  他们轻轻忽忽地医治我百姓的损伤，说：平安了！平安了！其实没有平安。
{Jer 8:12}  Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among the fallen; when I punish them, they shall be overthrown, says the LORD.
{Jer 8:12}  他们行可憎的事知道惭愧吗？不然，他们毫不惭愧，也不知羞耻。因此他们必在仆倒的人中仆倒；我向他们讨罪的时候，他们必致跌倒。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 8:13}  When I would gather them, declares the LORD, there are no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree; even the leaves are withered, and what I gave them has passed away from them."
{Jer 8:13}  耶和华说：我必使他们全然灭绝；葡萄树上必没有葡萄，无花果树上必没有果子，叶子也必枯干。我所赐给他们的，必离开他们过去。
{Jer 8:14}  Why do we sit still? Gather together; let us go into the fortified cities and perish there, for the LORD our God has doomed us to perish and has given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
{Jer 8:14}  我们为何静坐不动呢？我们当聚集，进入坚固城，在那里静默不言；因为耶和华我们的神使我们静默不言，又将苦胆水给我们喝，都因我们得罪了耶和华。
{Jer 8:15}  We looked for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, terror.
{Jer 8:15}  我们指望平安，却得不着好处；指望痊愈的时候，不料，受了惊惶。
{Jer 8:16}  "The snorting of their horses is heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighing of their stallions the whole land quakes. They come and devour the land and all that fills it, the city and those who dwell in it.
{Jer 8:16}  听见从但那里敌人的马喷鼻气，他的壮马发嘶声，全地就都震动；因为他们来吞灭这地和其上所有的，吞灭这城与其中的居民。
{Jer 8:17}  For behold, I am sending among you serpents, adders that cannot be charmed, and they shall bite you," declares the LORD.
{Jer 8:17}  看哪，我必使毒蛇到你们中间，是不服法术的，必咬你们。这是耶和华说的。

{Jer 8:18}  我有忧愁，愿能自慰；我心在我里面发昏。
{Jer 8:19}  Behold, the cry of the daughter of my people from the length and breadth of the land: "Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not in her?" "Why have they provoked me to anger with their carved images and with their foreign idols?"
{Jer 8:19}  听啊，是我百姓的哀声从极远之地而来，说：耶和华不在锡安吗？锡安的王不在其中吗？耶和华说：他们为什么以雕刻的偶像和外邦虚无的神惹我发怒呢？
{Jer 8:20}  "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved."
{Jer 8:20}  麦秋已过，夏令已完，我们还未得救！

{Jer 8:21}  先知说：因我百姓的损伤，我也受了损伤。我哀痛，惊惶将我抓住。
{Jer 8:22}  Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?
{Jer 8:22}  在基列岂没有乳香呢？在那里岂没有医生呢？我百姓为何不得痊愈呢？
{Jer 9:1}   Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
{Jer 9:1}   但愿我的头为水，我的眼为泪的泉源，我好为我百姓（原文作民女；七节同）中被杀的人昼夜哭泣。
{Jer 9:2}   Oh that I had in the desert a travelers' lodging place, that I might leave my people and go away from them! For they are all adulterers, a company of treacherous men.
{Jer 9:2}   惟愿我在旷野有行路人住宿之处，使我可以离开我的民出去；因他们都是行奸淫的，是行诡诈的一党。
{Jer 9:3}   They bend their tongue like a bow; falsehood and not truth has grown strong in the land; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know me, declares the LORD.
{Jer 9:3}   他们弯起舌头像弓一样，为要说谎话。他们在国中增长势力，不是为行诚实，乃是恶上加恶，并不认识我。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 9:4}   Let everyone beware of his neighbor, and put no trust in any brother, for every brother is a deceiver, and every neighbor goes about as a slanderer.
{Jer 9:4}   你们各人当谨防邻舍，不可信靠弟兄；因为弟兄尽行欺骗，邻舍都往来谗谤人。
{Jer 9:5}   Everyone deceives his neighbor, and no one speaks the truth; they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves committing iniquity.
{Jer 9:5}   他们各人欺哄邻舍，不说真话；他们教舌头学习说谎，劳劳碌碌地作孽。
{Jer 9:6}   Heaping oppression upon oppression, and deceit upon deceit, they refuse to know me, declares the LORD.
{Jer 9:6}   你的住处在诡诈的人中；他们因行诡诈，不肯认识我。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 9:7}   Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: "Behold, I will refine them and test them, for what else can I do, because of my people?
{Jer 9:7}   所以万军之耶和华如此说：看哪，我要将他们融化熬炼；不然，我因我百姓的罪该怎样行呢？
{Jer 9:8}   Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceitfully; with his mouth each speaks peace to his neighbor, but in his heart he plans an ambush for him.
{Jer 9:8}   他们的舌头是毒箭，说话诡诈；人与邻舍口说和平话，心却谋害他。
{Jer 9:9}   Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD, and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this?
{Jer 9:9}   耶和华说：我岂不因这些事讨他们的罪呢？岂不报复这样的国民呢？

{Jer 9:10}  我要为山岭哭泣悲哀，为旷野的草场扬声哀号；因为都已干焦，甚至无人经过。人也听不见牲畜鸣叫，空中的飞鸟和地上的野兽都已逃去。
{Jer 9:11}  I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a lair of jackals, and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant."
{Jer 9:11}  我必使耶路撒冷变为乱堆，为野狗的住处，也必使犹大的城邑变为荒场，无人居住。
{Jer 9:12}  Who is the man so wise that he can understand this? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined and laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?
{Jer 9:12}  谁是智慧人，可以明白这事？耶和华的口向谁说过，使他可以传说？遍地为何灭亡，干焦好像旷野，甚至无人经过呢？
{Jer 9:13}  And the LORD says: "Because they have forsaken my law that I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in accord with it,
{Jer 9:13}  耶和华说：“因为这百姓离弃我，在他们面前所设立的律法没有遵行，也没有听从我的话；
{Jer 9:14}  but have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them.
{Jer 9:14}  只随从自己顽梗的心行事，照他们列祖所教训的随从众巴力。”
{Jer 9:15}  Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will feed this people with bitter food, and give them poisonous water to drink.
{Jer 9:15}  所以万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：“看哪，我必将茵陈给这百姓吃，又将苦胆水给他们喝。

{Jer 9:17}  Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Consider, and call for the mourning women to come; send for the skillful women to come;
{Jer 9:17}  万军之耶和华如此说：你们应当思想，将善唱哀歌的妇女召来，又打发人召善哭的妇女来，
{Jer 9:18}  let them make haste and raise a wailing over us, that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids flow with water.
{Jer 9:18}  叫他们速速为我们举哀，使我们眼泪汪汪，使我们的眼皮涌出水来。
{Jer 9:19}  For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion: 'How we are ruined! We are utterly shamed, because we have left the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.'"
{Jer 9:19}  因为听见哀声出于锡安，说：我们怎样败落了！我们大大的惭愧！我们撇下地土；人也拆毁了我们的房屋。
{Jer 9:20}  Hear, O women, the word of the LORD, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; teach to your daughters a lament, and each to her neighbor a dirge.

{Jer 9:23}  Thus says the LORD: "Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches,
{Jer 9:23}  耶和华如此说：“智慧人不要因他的智慧夸口，勇士不要因他的勇力夸口，财主不要因他的财物夸口。
{Jer 9:24}  but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the LORD."
{Jer 9:24}  夸口的却因他有聪明，认识我是耶和华，又知道我喜悦在世上施行慈爱、公平，和公义，以此夸口。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 9:25}  "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will punish all those who are circumcised merely in the flesh--
{Jer 9:25}  耶和华说：“看哪，日子将到，我要刑罚一切受过割礼、心却未受割礼的，
{Jer 9:26}  Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all who dwell in the desert who cut the corners of their hair, for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart."
{Jer 9:26}  就是埃及、犹大、以东、亚扪人、摩押人，和一切住在旷野剃周围头发的；因为列国人都没有受割礼，以色列人心中也没有受割礼。”
{Jer 10:1}  Hear the word that the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.

{Jer 10:2}  耶和华如此说：你们不要效法列国的行为，也不要为天象惊惶，因列国为此事惊惶。
{Jer 10:3}  for the customs of the peoples are vanity. A tree from the forest is cut down and worked with an axe by the hands of a craftsman.
{Jer 10:3}  众民的风俗是虚空的；他们在树林中用斧子砍伐一棵树，匠人用手工造成偶像。
{Jer 10:4}  They decorate it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it cannot move.
{Jer 10:4}  他们用金银妆饰他，用钉子和锤子钉稳，使他不动摇。
{Jer 10:5}  Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak; they have to be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good."
{Jer 10:5}  他好像棕树，是镟成的，不能说话，不能行走，必须有人抬着。你们不要怕他；他不能降祸，也无力降福。
{Jer 10:6}  There is none like you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might.
{Jer 10:6}  耶和华啊，没有能比你的！你本为大，有大能大力的名。
{Jer 10:7}  Who would not fear you, O King of the nations? For this is your due; for among all the wise ones of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like you.
{Jer 10:7}  万国的王啊，谁不敬畏你？敬畏你本是合宜的；因为在列国的智慧人中，虽有政权的尊荣，也不能比你。
{Jer 10:8}  They are both stupid and foolish; the instruction of idols is but wood!
{Jer 10:8}  他们尽都是畜类，是愚昧的。偶像的训诲算什么呢？偶像不过是木头。
{Jer 10:9}  Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz. They are the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; their clothing is violet and purple; they are all the work of skilled men.
{Jer 10:9}  有银子打成片，是从他施带来的，并有从乌法来的金子，都是匠人和银匠的手工，又有蓝色紫色料的衣服，都是巧匠的工作。
{Jer 10:10} But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God and the everlasting King. At his wrath the earth quakes, and the nations cannot endure his indignation.
{Jer 10:10} 惟耶和华是真神，是活神，是永远的王。他一发怒，大地震动；他一恼恨，列国都担当不起。
{Jer 10:11} Thus shall you say to them: "The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens."
{Jer 10:11} （你们要对他们如此说：不是那创造天地的神，必从地上从天下被除灭！）
{Jer 10:12} It is he who made the earth by his power, who established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the heavens.
{Jer 10:12} 耶和华用能力创造大地，用智慧建立世界，用聪明铺张穹苍。
{Jer 10:13} When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, and he brings forth the wind from his storehouses.
{Jer 10:13} 他一发声，空中便有多水激动；他使云雾从地极上腾；他造电随雨而闪，从他府库中带出风来。
{Jer 10:14} Every man is stupid and without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, for his images are false, and there is no breath in them.
{Jer 10:14} 各人都成了畜类，毫无知识；各银匠都因他雕刻的偶像羞愧。他所铸的偶像本是虚假的，其中并无气息，
{Jer 10:15} They are worthless, a work of delusion; at the time of their punishment they shall perish.
{Jer 10:15} 都是虚无的，是迷惑人的工作；到追讨的时候必被除灭。
{Jer 10:16} Not like these is he who is the portion of Jacob, for he is the one who formed all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the LORD of hosts is his name.
{Jer 10:16} 雅各的分不像这些，因他是造作万有的主。以色列也是他产业的支派，万军之耶和华是他的名。
{Jer 10:17} Gather up your bundle from the ground, O you who dwell under siege!
{Jer 10:17} 受围困的人哪，当收拾你的财物，从国中带出去。
{Jer 10:18} For thus says the LORD: "Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and I will bring distress on them, that they may feel it."
{Jer 10:18} 因为耶和华如此说：这时候，我必将此地的居民，好像用机弦甩出去，又必加害在他们身上，使他们觉悟。
{Jer 10:19} Woe is me because of my hurt! My wound is grievous. But I said, "Truly this is an affliction, and I must bear it."
{Jer 10:19} 民说：祸哉！我受损伤；我的伤痕极其重大。我却说：这真是我的痛苦，必须忍受。
{Jer 10:20} My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken; my children have gone from me, and they are not; there is no one to spread my tent again and to set up my curtains.
{Jer 10:20} 我的帐棚毁坏；我的绳索折断。我的儿女离我出去，没有了。无人再支搭我的帐棚，挂起我的幔子。
{Jer 10:21} For the shepherds are stupid and do not inquire of the LORD; therefore they have not prospered, and all their flock is scattered.
{Jer 10:21} 因为牧人都成为畜类，没有求问耶和华，所以不得顺利；他们的羊群也都分散。
{Jer 10:22} A voice, a rumor! Behold, it comes!-- a great commotion out of the north country to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a lair of jackals.
{Jer 10:22} 有风声！看哪，敌人来了！有大扰乱从北方出来，要使犹大城邑变为荒凉，成为野狗的住处。
{Jer 10:23} I know, O LORD, that the way of man is not in himself, that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
{Jer 10:23} 耶和华啊，我晓得人的道路不由自己，行路的人也不能定自己的脚步。
{Jer 10:24} Correct me, O LORD, but in justice; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.
{Jer 10:24} 耶和华啊，求你从宽惩治我，不要在你的怒中惩治我，恐怕使我归于无有。
{Jer 10:25} Pour out your wrath on the nations that know you not, and on the peoples that call not on your name, for they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.
{Jer 10:25} 愿你将忿怒倾在不认识你的列国中，和不求告你名的各族上；因为他们吞了雅各，不但吞了，而且灭绝，把他的住处变为荒场。
{Jer 11:1}  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
{Jer 11:1}  耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 11:2}  "Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{Jer 11:2}  “当听这约的话，告诉犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民，
{Jer 11:3}  You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant
{Jer 11:3}  对他们说，耶和华以色列的神如此说：不听从这约之话的人必受咒诅。
{Jer 11:4}  that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God,
{Jer 11:4}  这约是我将你们列祖从埃及地领出来、脱离铁炉的那日所吩咐他们的，说：‘你们要听从我的话，照我一切所吩咐的去行。’这样，你们就作我的子民，我也作你们的神；
{Jer 11:5}  that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day." Then I answered, "So be it, LORD."
{Jer 11:5}  我好坚定向你们列祖所起的誓，给他们流奶与蜜之地，正如今日一样。”我就回答说：“耶和华啊，阿们！”
{Jer 11:6}  And the LORD said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
{Jer 11:6}  耶和华对我说：“你要在犹大城邑中和耶路撒冷街市上，宣告这一切话说：你们当听从遵行这约的话。
{Jer 11:7}  For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice.
{Jer 11:7}  因为我将你们列祖从埃及地领出来的那日，直到今日，都是从早起来，切切诰诫他们说：‘你们当听从我的话。’
{Jer 11:8}  Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not."
{Jer 11:8}  他们却不听从，不侧耳而听，竟随从自己顽梗的恶心去行。所以我使这约中一切咒诅的话临到他们身上；这约是我吩咐他们行的，他们却不去行。”
{Jer 11:9}  Again the LORD said to me, "A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{Jer 11:9}  耶和华对我说：“在犹大人和耶路撒冷居民中有同谋背叛的事。
{Jer 11:10} They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their fathers.
{Jer 11:10} 他们转去效法他们的先祖，不肯听我的话，犯罪作孽，又随从别神，事奉他。以色列家和犹大家背了我与他们列祖所立的约。”
{Jer 11:11} Therefore, thus says the LORD, Behold, I am bringing disaster upon them that they cannot escape. Though they cry to me, I will not listen to them.
{Jer 11:11} 所以耶和华如此说：“我必使灾祸临到他们，是他们不能逃脱的。他们必向我哀求，我却不听。
{Jer 11:12} Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they make offerings, but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble.
{Jer 11:12} 那时，犹大城邑的人和耶路撒冷的居民要去哀求他们烧香所供奉的神；只是遭难的时候，这些神毫不拯救他们。
{Jer 11:13} For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah, and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, altars to make offerings to Baal.
{Jer 11:13} 犹大啊，你神的数目与你城的数目相等；你为那可耻的巴力所筑烧香的坛也与耶路撒冷街道的数目相等。
{Jer 11:14} "Therefore do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble.
{Jer 11:14} “所以你不要为这百姓祈祷，不要为他们呼求祷告；因为他们遭难向我哀求的时候，我必不应允。
{Jer 11:15} What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done many vile deeds? Can even sacrificial flesh avert your doom? Can you then exult?
{Jer 11:15} 我所亲爱的，既行许多淫乱，圣肉也离了你，你在我殿中做什么呢？你作恶就喜乐。
{Jer 11:16} The LORD once called you 'a green olive tree, beautiful with good fruit.' But with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and its branches will be consumed.
{Jer 11:16} 从前耶和华给你起名叫青橄榄树，又华美又结好果子；如今他用哄嚷之声，点火在其上，枝子也被折断。
{Jer 11:17} The LORD of hosts, who planted you, has decreed disaster against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal."
{Jer 11:17} 原来栽培你的万军之耶和华已经说，要降祸攻击你，是因以色列家和犹大家行恶，向巴力烧香，惹我发怒，是自作自受。”
{Jer 11:18} The LORD made it known to me and I knew; then you showed me their deeds.
{Jer 11:18} 耶和华指示我，我就知道；你将他们所行的给我指明。
{Jer 11:19} But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter. I did not know it was against me they devised schemes, saying, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name be remembered no more."
{Jer 11:19} 我却像柔顺的羊羔被牵到宰杀之地；我并不知道他们设计谋害我，说：我们把树连果子都灭了吧！将他从活人之地剪除，使他的名不再被纪念。
{Jer 11:20} But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, who tests the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance upon them, for to you have I committed my cause.
{Jer 11:20} 按公义判断、察验人肺腑心肠的万军之耶和华啊，我却要见你在他们身上报仇，因我将我的案件向你禀明了。
{Jer 11:21} Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, and say, "Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand"--
{Jer 11:21} 所以，耶和华论到寻索你命的亚拿突人如此说：“他们说：你不要奉耶和华的名说预言，免得你死在我们手中。
{Jer 11:22} therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: "Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,
{Jer 11:22} 所以万军之耶和华如此说：看哪，我必刑罚他们；他们的少年人必被刀剑杀死，他们的儿女必因饥荒灭亡，
{Jer 11:23} and none of them shall be left. For I will bring disaster upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their punishment."
{Jer 11:23} 并且没有余剩的人留给他们；因为在追讨之年，我必使灾祸临到亚拿突人。”
{Jer 12:1}  Righteous are you, O LORD, when I complain to you; yet I would plead my case before you. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all who are treacherous thrive?
{Jer 12:1}  耶和华啊，我与你争辩的时候，你显为义；但有一件，我还要与你理论：恶人的道路为何亨通呢？大行诡诈的为何得安逸呢？
{Jer 12:2}  You plant them, and they take root; they grow and produce fruit; you are near in their mouth and far from their heart.
{Jer 12:2}  你栽培了他们，他们也扎了根，长大，而且结果。他们的口是与你相近，心却与你远离。
{Jer 12:3}  But you, O LORD, know me; you see me, and test my heart toward you. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and set them apart for the day of slaughter.
{Jer 12:3}  耶和华啊，你晓得我，看见我，察验我向你是怎样的心。求你将他们拉出来，好像将宰的羊，叫他们等候杀戮的日子。
{Jer 12:4}  How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? For the evil of those who dwell in it the beasts and the birds are swept away, because they said, "He will not see our latter end."
{Jer 12:4}  这地悲哀，通国的青草枯干，要到几时呢？因其上居民的恶行，牲畜和飞鸟都灭绝了。他们曾说：他看不见我们的结局。
{Jer 12:5}  "If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you, how will you compete with horses? And if in a safe land you are so trusting, what will you do in the thicket of the Jordan?
{Jer 12:5}  耶和华说：你若与步行的人同跑，尚且觉累，怎能与马赛跑呢？你在平安之地，虽然安稳，在约但河边的丛林要怎样行呢？
{Jer 12:6}  For even your brothers and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; they are in full cry after you; do not believe them, though they speak friendly words to you."
{Jer 12:6}  因为连你弟兄和你父家都用奸诈待你。他们也在你后边大声喊叫，虽向你说好话，你也不要信他们。
{Jer 12:7}  "I have forsaken my house; I have abandoned my heritage; I have given the beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies.
{Jer 12:7}  我离了我的殿宇，撇弃我的产业，将我心里所亲爱的交在他仇敌的手中。
{Jer 12:8}  My heritage has become to me like a lion in the forest; she has lifted up her voice against me; therefore I hate her.
{Jer 12:8}  我的产业向我如林中的狮子，他发声攻击我，因此我恨恶他。
{Jer 12:9}  Is my heritage to me like a hyena's lair? Are the birds of prey against her all around? Go, assemble all the wild beasts; bring them to devour.
{Jer 12:9}  我的产业向我岂如斑点的鸷鸟呢？鸷鸟岂在他四围攻击他呢？你们要去聚集田野的百兽，带来吞吃吧！
{Jer 12:10} Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard; they have trampled down my portion; they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
{Jer 12:10} 许多牧人毁坏我的葡萄园，践踏我的分，使我美好的分变为荒凉的旷野。
{Jer 12:11} They have made it a desolation; desolate, it mourns to me. The whole land is made desolate, but no man lays it to heart.
{Jer 12:11} 他们使地荒凉；地既荒凉，便向我悲哀。全地荒凉，因无人介意。
{Jer 12:12} Upon all the bare heights in the desert destroyers have come, for the sword of the LORD devours from one end of the land to the other; no flesh has peace.
{Jer 12:12} 灭命的都来到旷野中一切净光的高处；耶和华的刀从地这边直到地那边尽行杀灭。凡有血气的都不得平安。
{Jer 12:13} They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns; they have tired themselves out but profit nothing. They shall be ashamed of their harvests because of the fierce anger of the LORD."
{Jer 12:13} 他们种的是麦子，收的是荆棘；劳劳苦苦却毫无益处。因耶和华的烈怒，你们必为自己的土产羞愧。
{Jer 12:14} Thus says the LORD concerning all my evil neighbors who touch the heritage that I have given my people Israel to inherit: "Behold, I will pluck them up from their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
{Jer 12:14} 耶和华如此说：“一切恶邻，就是占据我使百姓以色列所承受产业的，我要将他们拔出本地，又要将犹大家从他们中间拔出来。
{Jer 12:15} And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them, and I will bring them again each to his heritage and each to his land.
{Jer 12:15} 我拔出他们以后，我必转过来怜悯他们，把他们再带回来，各归本业，各归故土。
{Jer 12:16} And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, 'As the LORD lives,' even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built up in the midst of my people.
{Jer 12:16} 他们若殷勤学习我百姓的道，指着我的名起誓说：‘我指着永生的耶和华起誓’，正如他们从前教我百姓指着巴力起誓，他们就必建立在我百姓中间。
{Jer 12:17} But if any nation will not listen, then I will utterly pluck it up and destroy it, declares the LORD."
{Jer 12:17} 他们若是不听，我必拔出那国，拔出而且毁灭。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 13:1}  Thus says the LORD to me, "Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it around your waist, and do not dip it in water."
{Jer 13:1}  耶和华对我如此说：“你去买一根麻布带子束腰，不可放在水中。”
{Jer 13:2}  So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the LORD, and put it around my waist.
{Jer 13:2}  我就照着耶和华的话，买了一根带子束腰。
{Jer 13:3}  And the word of the LORD came to me a second time,
{Jer 13:3}  耶和华的话第二次临到我说：
{Jer 13:4}  "Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a cleft of the rock."
{Jer 13:4}  “要拿着你所买的腰带，就是你腰上的带子，起来往伯拉河去，将腰带藏在那里的磐石穴中。”
{Jer 13:5}  So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
{Jer 13:5}  我就去，照着耶和华所吩咐我的，将腰带藏在伯拉河边。
{Jer 13:6}  And after many days the LORD said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there."
{Jer 13:6}  过了多日，耶和华对我说：“你起来往伯拉河去，将我吩咐你藏在那里的腰带取出来。”
{Jer 13:7}  Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing.
{Jer 13:7}  我就往伯拉河去，将腰带从我所藏的地方刨出来，见腰带已经变坏，毫无用了。
{Jer 13:8}  Then the word of the LORD came to me:
{Jer 13:8}  耶和华的话临到我说：
{Jer 13:9}  "Thus says the LORD: Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
{Jer 13:9}  “耶和华如此说：我必照样败坏犹大的骄傲和耶路撒冷的大骄傲。
{Jer 13:10} This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing.
{Jer 13:10} 这恶民不肯听我的话，按自己顽梗的心而行，随从别神，事奉敬拜，他们也必像这腰带变为无用。”
{Jer 13:11} For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the LORD, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.
{Jer 13:11} 耶和华说：“腰带怎样紧贴人腰，照样，我也使以色列全家和犹大全家紧贴我，好叫他们属我为子民，使我得名声，得颂赞，得荣耀；他们却不肯听。”
{Jer 13:12} "You shall speak to them this word: 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Every jar shall be filled with wine."' And they will say to you, 'Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?'
{Jer 13:12} “所以你要对他们说：‘耶和华以色列的神如此说：各都要盛满了酒。’他们必对你说：‘我们岂不确知各都要盛满了酒呢？’
{Jer 13:13} Then you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{Jer 13:13} 你就要对他们说：‘耶和华如此说：我必使这地的一切居民，就是坐大卫宝座的君王和祭司，与先知，并耶路撒冷的一切居民，都酩酊大醉。’”
{Jer 13:14} And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, declares the LORD. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.'"
{Jer 13:14} 耶和华说：“我要使他们彼此相碰，就是父与子彼此相碰；我必不可怜，不顾惜，不怜悯，以致灭绝他们。”
{Jer 13:15} Hear and give ear; be not proud, for the LORD has spoken.
{Jer 13:15} 你们当听，当侧耳而听。不要骄傲，因为耶和华已经说了。
{Jer 13:16} Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the twilight mountains, and while you look for light he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness.
{Jer 13:16} 耶和华你们的神未使黑暗来到，你们的脚未在昏暗山上绊跌之先，当将荣耀归给他；免得你们盼望光明，他使光明变为死荫，成为幽暗。
{Jer 13:17} But if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock has been taken captive.
{Jer 13:17} 你们若不听这话，我必因你们的骄傲在暗地哭泣；我眼必痛哭流泪，因为耶和华的群众被掳去了。
{Jer 13:18} Say to the king and the queen mother: "Take a lowly seat, for your beautiful crown has come down from your head."
{Jer 13:18} 你要对君王和太后说：你们当自卑，坐在下边；因你们的头巾，就是你们的华冠，已经脱落了。
{Jer 13:19} The cities of the Negeb are shut up, with none to open them; all Judah is taken into exile, wholly taken into exile.
{Jer 13:19} 南方的城尽都关闭，无人开放；犹大全被掳掠，且掳掠净尽。
{Jer 13:20} "Lift up your eyes and see those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?
{Jer 13:20} 你们要举目观看从北方来的人。先前赐给你的群众，就是你佳美的群众，如今在那里呢？
{Jer 13:21} What will you say when they set as head over you those whom you yourself have taught to be friends to you? Will not pangs take hold of you like those of a woman in labor?
{Jer 13:21} 耶和华立你自己所交的朋友为首，辖制你，那时你还有什么话说呢？痛苦岂不将你抓住像产难的妇人吗？
{Jer 13:22} And if you say in your heart, 'Why have these things come upon me?' it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up and you suffer violence.
{Jer 13:22} 你若心里说：这一切事为何临到我呢？你的衣襟揭起，你的脚跟受伤，是因你的罪孽甚多。
{Jer 13:23} Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.
{Jer 13:23} 古实人岂能改变皮肤呢？豹岂能改变斑点呢？若能，你们这习惯行恶的便能行善了。
{Jer 13:24} I will scatter you like chaff driven by the wind from the desert.
{Jer 13:24} 所以我必用旷野的风吹散他们，像吹过的碎秸一样。
{Jer 13:25} This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you, declares the LORD, because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies.
{Jer 13:25} 耶和华说：这是你所当得的，是我量给你的分；因为你忘记我，倚靠虚假（或作：偶像）。
{Jer 13:26} I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, and your shame will be seen.
{Jer 13:26} 所以我要揭起你的衣襟，蒙在你脸上，显出你的丑陋。
{Jer 13:27} I have seen your abominations, your adulteries and neighings, your lewd whorings, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will it be before you are made clean?"
{Jer 13:27} 你那些可憎恶之事，就是在田野的山上行奸淫，发嘶声，做淫乱的事我都看见了。耶路撒冷啊，你有祸了！你不肯洁净，还要到几时呢？
{Jer 14:1}  The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
{Jer 14:1}  耶和华论到干旱之灾的话临到耶利米：
{Jer 14:2}  "Judah mourns, and her gates languish; her people lament on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.
{Jer 14:2}  犹大悲哀，城门衰败。众人披上黑衣坐在地上；耶路撒冷的哀声上达。
{Jer 14:3}  Her nobles send their servants for water; they come to the cisterns; they find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are ashamed and confounded and cover their heads.
{Jer 14:3}  他们的贵胄打发家僮打水；他们来到水池，见没有水，就拿着空器皿，蒙羞惭愧，抱头而回。
{Jer 14:4}  Because of the ground that is dismayed, since there is no rain on the land, the farmers are ashamed; they cover their heads.
{Jer 14:4}  耕地的也蒙羞抱头；因为无雨降在地上，地都干裂。
{Jer 14:5}  Even the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn because there is no grass.
{Jer 14:5}  田野的母鹿生下小鹿，就撇弃，因为无草。
{Jer 14:6}  The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail because there is no vegetation.
{Jer 14:6}  野驴站在净光的高处，喘气好像野狗；因为无草，眼目失明。
{Jer 14:7}  "Though our iniquities testify against us, act, O LORD, for your name's sake; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you.
{Jer 14:7}  耶和华啊，我们的罪孽虽然作见证告我们，还求你为你名的缘故行事。我们本是多次背道，得罪了你。
{Jer 14:8}  O you hope of Israel, its savior in time of trouble, why should you be like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who turns aside to tarry for a night?
{Jer 14:8}  以色列所盼望、在患难时作他救主的啊，你为何在这地像寄居的，又像行路的只住一宵呢？
{Jer 14:9}  Why should you be like a man confused, like a mighty warrior who cannot save? Yet you, O LORD, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; do not leave us."
{Jer 14:9}  你为何像受惊的人，像不能救人的勇士呢？耶和华啊，你仍在我们中间；我们也称为你名下的人，求你不要离开我们。
{Jer 14:10} Thus says the LORD concerning this people: "They have loved to wander thus; they have not restrained their feet; therefore the LORD does not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins."
{Jer 14:10} 耶和华对这百姓如此说：这百姓喜爱妄行（原文作飘流），不禁止脚步，所以耶和华不悦纳他们。现今要记念他们的罪孽，追讨他们的罪恶。
{Jer 14:11} The LORD said to me: "Do not pray for the welfare of this people.
{Jer 14:11} 耶和华又对我说：“不要为这百姓祈祷求好处。
{Jer 14:12} Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence."
{Jer 14:12} 他们禁食的时候，我不听他们的呼求；他们献燔祭和素祭，我也不悦纳；我却要用刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫灭绝他们。”
{Jer 14:13} Then I said: "Ah, Lord GOD, behold, the prophets say to them, 'You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.'"
{Jer 14:13} 我就说：“唉！主耶和华啊，那些先知常对他们说：‘你们必不看见刀剑，也不遭遇饥荒；耶和华要在这地方赐你们长久的平安。’”
{Jer 14:14} And the LORD said to me: "The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own minds.
{Jer 14:14} 耶和华对我说：“那些先知托我的名说假预言，我并没有打发他们，没有吩咐他们，也没有对他们说话；他们向你们预言的，乃是虚假的异象和占卜，并虚无的事，以及本心的诡诈。
{Jer 14:15} Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although I did not send them, and who say, 'Sword and famine shall not come upon this land': By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.
{Jer 14:15} 所以耶和华如此说：论到托我名说预言的那些先知，我并没有打发他们；他们还说这地不能有刀剑饥荒，其实那些先知必被刀剑饥荒灭绝。
{Jer 14:16} And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, with none to bury them--them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their evil upon them.
{Jer 14:16} 听他们说预言的百姓必因饥荒刀剑抛在耶路撒冷的街道上，无人葬埋。他们连妻子带儿女，都是如此。我必将他们的恶倒在他们身上（或作：我必使他们罪恶的报应临到他们身上）。”
{Jer 14:17} "You shall say to them this word: 'Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter of my people is shattered with a great wound, with a very grievous blow.
{Jer 14:17} 你要将这话对他们说：愿我眼泪汪汪，昼夜不息，因为我百姓（原文作民的处女）受了裂口破坏的大伤。
{Jer 14:18} If I go out into the field, behold, those pierced by the sword! And if I enter the city, behold, the diseases of famine! For both prophet and priest ply their trade through the land and have no knowledge.'"
{Jer 14:18} 我若出往田间，就见有被刀杀的；我若进入城内，就见有因饥荒患病的；连先知带祭司在国中往来，也是毫无知识（或作：不知怎样才好）。
{Jer 14:19} Have you utterly rejected Judah? Does your soul loathe Zion? Why have you struck us down so that there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, terror.
{Jer 14:19} 你全然弃掉犹大吗？你心厌恶锡安吗？为何击打我们，以致无法医治呢？我们指望平安，却得不着好处；指望痊愈，不料，受了惊惶。

{Jer 15:2}  And when they ask you, 'Where shall we go?' you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: "'Those who are for pestilence, to pestilence, and those who are for the sword, to the sword; those who are for famine, to famine, and those who are for captivity, to captivity.'
{Jer 15:2}  他们问你说：‘我们往那里去呢？’你便告诉他们，耶和华如此说：定为死亡的，必致死亡；定为刀杀的，必交刀杀；定为饥荒的，必遭饥荒；定为掳掠的，必被掳掠。”
{Jer 15:3}  I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, declares the LORD: the sword to kill, the dogs to tear, and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
{Jer 15:3}  耶和华说：“我命定四样害他们，就是刀剑杀戮、狗类撕裂、空中的飞鸟，和地上的野兽吞吃毁灭；
{Jer 15:4}  And I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.

{Jer 15:15} 耶和华啊，你是知道的；求你记念我，眷顾我，向逼迫我的人为我报仇；不要向他们忍怒取我的命，要知道我为你的缘故受了凌辱。
{Jer 15:16} Your words were found, and I ate them, and your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart, for I am called by your name, O LORD, God of hosts.
{Jer 15:16} 耶和华万军之神啊，我得着你的言语就当食物吃了；你的言语是我心中的欢喜快乐，因我是称为你名下的人。
{Jer 15:17} I did not sit in the company of revelers, nor did I rejoice; I sat alone, because your hand was upon me, for you had filled me with indignation.
{Jer 15:17} 我没有坐在宴乐人的会中，也没有欢乐；我因你的感动（原文作手）独自静坐，因你使我满心愤恨。
{Jer 15:18} Why is my pain unceasing, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will you be to me like a deceitful brook, like waters that fail?
{Jer 15:18} 我的痛苦为何长久不止呢？我的伤痕为何无法医治、不能痊愈呢？难道你待我有诡诈，像流干的河道吗？
{Jer 15:19} Therefore thus says the LORD: "If you return, I will restore you, and you shall stand before me. If you utter what is precious, and not what is worthless, you shall be as my mouth. They shall turn to you, but you shall not turn to them.
{Jer 15:19} 耶和华如此说：你若归回，我就将你再带来，使你站在我面前；你若将宝贵的和下贱的分别出来，你就可以当作我的口。他们必归向你，你却不可归向他们。

{Jer 16:1}  The word of the LORD came to me:
{Jer 16:1}  耶和华的话又临到我说：
{Jer 16:2}  "You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.
{Jer 16:2}  “你在这地方不可娶妻，生儿养女。
{Jer 16:3}  For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who fathered them in this land:
{Jer 16:3}  因为论到在这地方所生的儿女，又论到在这国中生养他们的父母，耶和华如此说：
{Jer 16:4}  They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried. They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. They shall perish by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.
{Jer 16:4}  他们必死得甚苦，无人哀哭，必不得葬埋，必在地上像粪土，必被刀剑和饥荒灭绝；他们的尸首必给空中的飞鸟和地上的野兽作食物。”
{Jer 16:5}  "For thus says the LORD: Do not enter the house of mourning, or go to lament or grieve for them, for I have taken away my peace from this people, my steadfast love and mercy, declares the LORD.
{Jer 16:5}  耶和华如此说：“不要进入丧家，不要去哀哭，也不要为他们悲伤，因我已将我的平安、慈爱、怜悯从这百姓夺去了。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 16:6}  Both great and small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, and no one shall lament for them or cut himself or make himself bald for them.
{Jer 16:6}  连大带小，都必在这地死亡，不得葬埋。人必不为他们哀哭，不用刀划身，也不使头光秃。

{Jer 16:8}  你不可进入宴乐的家，与他们同坐吃喝。
{Jer 16:9}  For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will silence in this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
{Jer 16:9}  因为万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：你们还活着的日子在你们眼前，我必使欢喜和快乐的声音，新郎和新妇的声音，从这地方止息了。
{Jer 16:10} "And when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, 'Why has the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?'
{Jer 16:10} “你将这一切的话指示这百姓。他们问你说：‘耶和华为什么说，要降这大灾祸攻击我们呢？我们有什么罪孽呢？我们向耶和华我们的神犯了什么罪呢？’
{Jer 16:11} then you shall say to them: 'Because your fathers have forsaken me, declares the LORD, and have gone after other gods and have served and worshiped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law,
{Jer 16:11} 你就对他们说：‘耶和华说：因为你们列祖离弃我，随从别神，事奉敬拜，不遵守我的律法，
{Jer 16:12} and because you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, every one of you follows his stubborn, evil will, refusing to listen to me.
{Jer 16:12} 而且你们行恶比你们列祖更甚；因为各人随从自己顽梗的恶心行事，甚至不听从我，
{Jer 16:13} Therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.'
{Jer 16:13} 所以我必将你们从这地赶出，直赶到你们和你们列祖素不认识的地。你们在那里必昼夜事奉别神，因为我必不向你们施恩。’”
{Jer 16:14} "Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it shall no longer be said, 'As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'
{Jer 16:14} 耶和华说：“日子将到，人必不再指着那领以色列人从埃及地上来之永生的耶和华起誓，
{Jer 16:15} but 'As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.' For I will bring them back to their own land that I gave to their fathers.
{Jer 16:15} 却要指着那领以色列人从北方之地，并赶他们到的各国上来之永生的耶和华起誓，并且我要领他们再入我从前赐给他们列祖之地。”
{Jer 16:16} "Behold, I am sending for many fishers, declares the LORD, and they shall catch them. And afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
{Jer 16:16} 耶和华说：“我要召许多打鱼的把以色列人打上来，然后我要召许多打猎的，从各山上、各冈上、各石穴中猎取他们。
{Jer 16:17} For my eyes are on all their ways. They are not hidden from me, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.
{Jer 16:17} 因我的眼目察看他们的一切行为；他们不能在我面前遮掩，他们的罪孽也不能在我眼前隐藏。
{Jer 16:18} But first I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations."
{Jer 16:18} 我先要加倍报应他们的罪孽和罪恶；因为他们用可憎之尸玷污我的地土，又用可厌之物充满我的产业。”
{Jer 16:19} O LORD, my strength and my stronghold, my refuge in the day of trouble, to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth and say: "Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, worthless things in which there is no profit.
{Jer 16:19} 耶和华啊，你是我的力量，是我的保障；在苦难之日是我的避难所。列国人必从地极来到你这里，说：我们列祖所承受的，不过是虚假，是虚空无益之物。
{Jer 16:20} Can man make for himself gods? Such are not gods!"
{Jer 16:20} 人岂可为自己制造神呢？其实这不是神。
{Jer 16:21} "Therefore, behold, I will make them know, this once I will make them know my power and my might, and they shall know that my name is the LORD."
{Jer 16:21} 耶和华说：“我要使他们知道，就是这一次使他们知道我的手和我的能力。他们就知道我的名是耶和华了。”
{Jer 17:1}  "The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron; with a point of diamond it is engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of their altars,
{Jer 17:1}  犹大的罪是用铁笔、用金钢钻记录的，铭刻在他们的心版上和坛角上。
{Jer 17:2}  while their children remember their altars and their Asherim, beside every green tree and on the high hills,
{Jer 17:2}  他们的儿女记念他们高冈上、青翠树旁的坛和木偶。
{Jer 17:3}  on the mountains in the open country. Your wealth and all your treasures I will give for spoil as the price of your high places for sin throughout all your territory.
{Jer 17:3}  我田野的山哪，我必因你在四境之内所犯的罪，把你的货物、财宝，并邱坛当掠物交给仇敌；
{Jer 17:4}  You shall loosen your hand from your heritage that I gave to you, and I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever."
{Jer 17:4}  并且你因自己的罪必失去我所赐给你的产业。我也必使你在你所不认识的地上服事你的仇敌；因为你使我怒中起火，直烧到永远。
{Jer 17:5}  Thus says the LORD: "Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the LORD.
{Jer 17:5}  耶和华如此说：倚靠人血肉的膀臂，心中离弃耶和华的，那人有祸了！
{Jer 17:6}  He is like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see any good come. He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.
{Jer 17:6}  因他必像沙漠的杜松，不见福乐来到，却要住旷野干旱之处，无人居住的硷地。
{Jer 17:7}  "Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD.
{Jer 17:7}  倚靠耶和华、以耶和华为可靠的，那人有福了！
{Jer 17:8}  He is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit."
{Jer 17:8}  他必像树栽于水旁，在河边扎根，炎热来到，并不惧怕，叶子仍必青翠，在干旱之年毫无挂虑，而且结果不止。
{Jer 17:9}  The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?
{Jer 17:9}  人心比万物都诡诈，坏到极处，谁能识透呢？
{Jer 17:10} "I the LORD search the heart and test the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds."
{Jer 17:10} 我耶和华是鉴察人心、试验人肺腑的，要照各人所行的和他做事的结果报应他。
{Jer 17:11} Like the partridge that gathers a brood that she did not hatch, so is he who gets riches but not by justice; in the midst of his days they will leave him, and at his end he will be a fool.
{Jer 17:11} 那不按正道得财的，好像鹧鸪抱不是自己下的蛋；到了中年，那财都必离开他，他终久成为愚顽人。
{Jer 17:12} A glorious throne set on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.
{Jer 17:12} 我们的圣所是荣耀的宝座，从太初安置在高处。
{Jer 17:13} O LORD, the hope of Israel, all who forsake you shall be put to shame; those who turn away from you shall be written in the earth, for they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living water.
{Jer 17:13} 耶和华以色列的盼望啊，凡离弃你的必致蒙羞。耶和华说：离开我的，他们的名字必写在土里，因为他们离弃我这活水的泉源。
{Jer 17:14} Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.
{Jer 17:14} 耶和华啊，求你医治我，我便痊愈，拯救我，我便得救；因你是我所赞美的。
{Jer 17:15} Behold, they say to me, "Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come!"
{Jer 17:15} 他们对我说：耶和华的话在那里呢？叫这话应验吧！
{Jer 17:16} I have not run away from being your shepherd, nor have I desired the day of sickness. You know what came out of my lips; it was before your face.
{Jer 17:16} 至于我，那跟从你作牧人的职分，我并没有急忙离弃，也没有想那灾殃的日子；这是你知道的。我口中所出的言语都在你面前。
{Jer 17:17} Be not a terror to me; you are my refuge in the day of disaster.
{Jer 17:17} 不要使我因你惊恐；当灾祸的日子，你是我的避难所。
{Jer 17:18} Let those be put to shame who persecute me, but let me not be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed; bring upon them the day of disaster; destroy them with double destruction!
{Jer 17:18} 愿那些逼迫我的蒙羞，却不要使我蒙羞；使他们惊惶，却不要使我惊惶；使灾祸的日子临到他们，以加倍的毁坏毁坏他们。
{Jer 17:19} Thus said the LORD to me: "Go and stand in the People's Gate, by which the kings of Judah enter and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem,
{Jer 17:19} 耶和华对我如此说：“你去站在平民的门口，就是犹大君王出入的门，又站在耶路撒冷的各门口，
{Jer 17:20} and say: 'Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates.
{Jer 17:20} 对他们说：‘你们这犹大君王和犹大众人，并耶路撒冷的一切居民，凡从这些门进入的都当听耶和华的话。
{Jer 17:21} Thus says the LORD: Take care for the sake of your lives, and do not bear a burden on the Sabbath day or bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.
{Jer 17:21} 耶和华如此说：你们要谨慎，不要在安息日担什么担子进入耶路撒冷的各门；
{Jer 17:22} And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath or do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers.
{Jer 17:22} 也不要在安息日从家中担出担子去。无论何工都不可做，只要以安息日为圣日，正如我所吩咐你们列祖的。’
{Jer 17:23} Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck, that they might not hear and receive instruction.
{Jer 17:23} 他们却不听从，不侧耳而听，竟硬着颈项不听，不受教训。”
{Jer 17:24} "'But if you listen to me, declares the LORD, and bring in no burden by the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but keep the Sabbath day holy and do no work on it,
{Jer 17:24} 耶和华说：“你们若留意听从我，在安息日不担什么担子进入这城的各门，只以安息日为圣日，在那日无论何工都不做；
{Jer 17:25} then there shall enter by the gates of this city kings and princes who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their officials, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall be inhabited forever.
{Jer 17:25} 那时就有坐大卫宝座的君王和首领，他们与犹大人，并耶路撒冷的居民，或坐车，或骑马，进入这城的各门，而且这城必存到永远。
{Jer 17:26} And people shall come from the cities of Judah and the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the Shephelah, from the hill country, and from the Negeb, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and frankincense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the LORD.
{Jer 17:26} 也必有人从犹大城邑和耶路撒冷四围的各处，从便雅悯地、高原、山地，并南地而来，都带燔祭、平安祭、素祭，和乳香，并感谢祭，到耶和华的殿去。
{Jer 17:27} But if you do not listen to me, to keep the Sabbath day holy, and not to bear a burden and enter by the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem and shall not be quenched.'"
{Jer 17:27} 你们若不听从我，不以安息日为圣日，仍在安息日担担子，进入耶路撒冷的各门，我必在各门中点火；这火也必烧毁耶路撒冷的宫殿，不能熄灭。”
{Jer 18:1}  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
{Jer 18:1}  耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 18:2}  "Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you hear my words."
{Jer 18:2}  “你起来，下到窑匠的家里去，我在那里要使你听我的话。”
{Jer 18:3}  So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was working at his wheel.
{Jer 18:3}  我就下到窑匠的家里去，正遇他转轮做器皿。
{Jer 18:4}  And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do.
{Jer 18:4}  窑匠用泥做的器皿，在他手中做坏了，他又用这泥另做别的器皿；窑匠看怎样好，就怎样做。
{Jer 18:5}  Then the word of the LORD came to me:
{Jer 18:5}  耶和华的话就临到我说：
{Jer 18:6}  "O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the LORD. Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
{Jer 18:6}  “耶和华说：以色列家啊，我待你们，岂不能照这窑匠弄泥吗？以色列家啊，泥在窑匠的手中怎样，你们在我的手中也怎样。
{Jer 18:7}  If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it,
{Jer 18:7}  我何时论到一邦或一国说，要拔出、拆毁、毁坏；
{Jer 18:8}  and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it.
{Jer 18:8}  我所说的那一邦，若是转意离开他们的恶，我就必后悔，不将我想要施行的灾祸降与他们。
{Jer 18:9}  And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it,
{Jer 18:9}  我何时论到一邦或一国说，要建立、栽植；
{Jer 18:10} and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it.
{Jer 18:10} 他们若行我眼中看为恶的事，不听从我的话，我就必后悔，不将我所说的福气赐给他们。
{Jer 18:11} Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: 'Thus says the LORD, Behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Return, every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.'
{Jer 18:11} 现在你要对犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民说：‘耶和华如此说：我造出灾祸攻击你们，定意刑罚你们。你们各人当回头离开所行的恶道，改正你们的行动作为。’
{Jer 18:12} "But they say, 'That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.'
{Jer 18:12} “他们却说：‘这是枉然。我们要照自己的计谋去行。’各人随自己顽梗的恶心做事。”
{Jer 18:13} "Therefore thus says the LORD: Ask among the nations, Who has heard the like of this? The virgin Israel has done a very horrible thing.
{Jer 18:13} 所以，耶和华如此说：你们且往各国访问，有谁听见这样的事？以色列民（原文作处女）行了一件极可憎恶的事。
{Jer 18:14} Does the snow of Lebanon leave the crags of Sirion? Do the mountain waters run dry, the cold flowing streams?
{Jer 18:14} 利巴嫩的雪从田野的磐石上岂能断绝呢？从远处流下的凉水岂能干涸呢？
{Jer 18:15} But my people have forgotten me; they make offerings to false gods; they made them stumble in their ways, in the ancient roads, and to walk into side roads, not the highway,
{Jer 18:15} 我的百姓竟忘记我，向假神烧香，使他们在所行的路上，在古道上绊跌，使他们行没有修筑的斜路，
{Jer 18:16} making their land a horror, a thing to be hissed at forever. Everyone who passes by it is horrified and shakes his head.
{Jer 18:16} 以致他们的地令人惊骇，常常嗤笑；凡经过这地的必惊骇摇头。
{Jer 18:17} Like the east wind I will scatter them before the enemy. I will show them my back, not my face, in the day of their calamity."
{Jer 18:17} 我必在仇敌面前分散他们，好像用东风吹散一样。遭难的日子，我必以背向他们，不以面向他们。
{Jer 18:18} Then they said, "Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words."
{Jer 18:18} 他们就说：“来吧！我们可以设计谋害耶利米；因为我们有祭司讲律法，智慧人设谋略，先知说预言，都不能断绝。来吧！我们可以用舌头击打他，不要理会他的一切话。”
{Jer 18:19} Hear me, O LORD, and listen to the voice of my adversaries.
{Jer 18:19} 耶和华啊，求你理会我，且听那些与我争竞之人的话。
{Jer 18:20} Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for my life. Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.
{Jer 18:20} 岂可以恶报善呢？他们竟挖坑要害我的性命！求你记念我怎样站在你面前为他们代求，要使你的忿怒向他们转消。
{Jer 18:21} Therefore deliver up their children to famine; give them over to the power of the sword; let their wives become childless and widowed. May their men meet death by pestilence, their youths be struck down by the sword in battle.
{Jer 18:21} 故此，愿你将他们的儿女交与饥荒和刀剑；愿他们的妻无子，且作寡妇；又愿他们的男人被死亡所灭，他们的少年人在阵上被刀击杀。
{Jer 18:22} May a cry be heard from their houses, when you bring the plunderer suddenly upon them! For they have dug a pit to take me and laid snares for my feet.
{Jer 18:22} 你使敌军忽然临到他们的时候，愿人听见哀声从他们的屋内发出；因他们挖坑要捉拿我，暗设网罗要绊我的脚。
{Jer 18:23} Yet you, O LORD, know all their plotting to kill me. Forgive not their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from your sight. Let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger.
{Jer 18:23} 耶和华啊，他们要杀我的那一切计谋，你都知道。不要赦免他们的罪孽，也不要从你面前涂抹他们的罪恶，要叫他们在你面前跌倒；愿你发怒的时候罚办他们。
{Jer 19:1}  Thus says the LORD, "Go, buy a potter's earthenware flask, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the elders of the priests,
{Jer 19:1}  耶和华如此说：“你去买窑匠的瓦瓶，又带百姓中的长老和祭司中的长老，
{Jer 19:2}  and go out to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you.
{Jer 19:2}  出去到欣嫩子谷、哈珥西（就是瓦片的意思）的门口那里，宣告我所吩咐你的话，
{Jer 19:3}  You shall say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing such disaster upon this place that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
{Jer 19:3}  说：‘犹大君王和耶路撒冷的居民哪，当听耶和华的话。万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：我必使灾祸临到这地方，凡听见的人都必耳鸣；
{Jer 19:4}  Because the people have forsaken me and have profaned this place by making offerings in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have known; and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
{Jer 19:4}  因为他们和他们列祖，并犹大君王离弃我，将这地方看为平常，在这里向素不认识的别神烧香，又使这地方满了无辜人的血，
{Jer 19:5}  and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into my mind--
{Jer 19:5}  又建筑巴力的邱坛，好在火中焚烧自己的儿子，作为燔祭献给巴力。这不是我所吩咐的，不是我所提说的，也不是我心所起的意。
{Jer 19:6}  therefore, behold, days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place shall no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
{Jer 19:6}  耶和华说：因此，日子将到，这地方不再称为陀斐特和欣嫩子谷，反倒称为杀戮谷。
{Jer 19:7}  And in this place I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, and will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth.
{Jer 19:7}  我必在这地方使犹大和耶路撒冷的计谋落空，也必使他们在仇敌面前倒于刀下，并寻索其命的人手下。他们的尸首，我必给空中的飞鸟和地上的野兽作食物。
{Jer 19:8}  And I will make this city a horror, a thing to be hissed at. Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its wounds.
{Jer 19:8}  我必使这城令人惊骇嗤笑；凡经过的人，必因这城所遭的灾惊骇嗤笑。
{Jer 19:9}  And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and everyone shall eat the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies and those who seek their life afflict them.'
{Jer 19:9}  我必使他们在围困窘迫之中，就是仇敌和寻索其命的人窘迫他们的时候，各人吃自己儿女的肉和朋友的肉。’
{Jer 19:10} "Then you shall break the flask in the sight of the men who go with you,
{Jer 19:10} “你要在同去的人眼前打碎那瓶，
{Jer 19:11} and shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: So will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, so that it can never be mended. Men shall bury in Topheth because there will be no place else to bury.
{Jer 19:11} 对他们说：‘万军之耶和华如此说：我要照样打碎这民和这城，正如人打碎窑匠的瓦器，以致不能再囫囵。并且人要在陀斐特葬埋尸首，甚至无处可葬。
{Jer 19:12} Thus will I do to this place, declares the LORD, and to its inhabitants, making this city like Topheth.
{Jer 19:12} 耶和华说：我必向这地方和其中的居民如此行，使这城与陀斐特一样。
{Jer 19:13} The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah--all the houses on whose roofs offerings have been offered to all the host of heaven, and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods--shall be defiled like the place of Topheth.'"
{Jer 19:13} 耶路撒冷的房屋和犹大君王的宫殿是已经被玷污的，就是他们在其上向天上的万象烧香、向别神浇奠祭的宫殿房屋，都必与陀斐特一样。’”
{Jer 19:14} Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the LORD's house and said to all the people:
{Jer 19:14} 耶利米从陀斐特，就是耶和华差他去说预言的地方回来，站在耶和华殿的院中，对众人说：
{Jer 19:15} "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, behold, I am bringing upon this city and upon all its towns all the disaster that I have pronounced against it, because they have stiffened their neck, refusing to hear my words."
{Jer 19:15} “万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：我必使我所说的一切灾祸临到这城和属城的一切城邑，因为他们硬着颈项不听我的话。”
{Jer 20:1}  Now Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
{Jer 20:1}  祭司音麦的儿子巴施户珥作耶和华殿的总管，听见耶利米预言这些事，
{Jer 20:2}  Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the LORD.
{Jer 20:2}  他就打先知耶利米，用耶和华殿里便雅悯高门内的枷，将他枷在那里。
{Jer 20:3}  The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, "The LORD does not call your name Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side.
{Jer 20:3}  次日，巴施户珥将耶利米开枷释放。于是耶利米对他说：“耶和华不是叫你的名为巴施户珥，乃是叫你玛歌珥米撒毕（就是四面惊吓的意思），
{Jer 20:4}  For thus says the LORD: Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall strike them down with the sword.
{Jer 20:4}  因耶和华如此说：‘我必使你自觉惊吓，你也必使众朋友惊吓；他们必倒在仇敌的刀下，你也必亲眼看见；我必将犹大人全交在巴比伦王的手中，他要将他们掳到巴比伦去，也要用刀将他们杀戮。
{Jer 20:5}  Moreover, I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.
{Jer 20:5}  并且我要将这城中的一切货财和劳碌得来的，并一切珍宝，以及犹大君王所有的宝物，都交在他们仇敌的手中；仇敌要当作掠物带到巴比伦去。
{Jer 20:6}  And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. To Babylon you shall go, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely."
{Jer 20:6}  你这巴施户珥和一切住在你家中的人都必被掳去；你和你的众朋友，就是你向他们说假预言的，都必到巴比伦去，要死在那里，葬在那里。’”
{Jer 20:7}  O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and you have prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all the day; everyone mocks me.
{Jer 20:7}  耶和华啊，你曾劝导我，我也听了你的劝导。你比我有力量，且胜了我。我终日成为笑话，人人都戏弄我。
{Jer 20:8}  For whenever I speak, I cry out, I shout, "Violence and destruction!" For the word of the LORD has become for me a reproach and derision all day long.
{Jer 20:8}  我每逢讲论的时候，就发出哀声，我喊叫说：有强暴和毁灭！因为耶和华的话终日成了我的凌辱、讥刺。
{Jer 20:9}  If I say, "I will not mention him, or speak any more in his name," there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot.
{Jer 20:9}  我若说：我不再提耶和华，也不再奉他的名讲论，我便心里觉得似乎有烧着的火闭塞在我骨中，我就含忍不住，不能自禁。
{Jer 20:10} For I hear many whispering. Terror is on every side! "Denounce him! Let us denounce him!" say all my close friends, watching for my fall. "Perhaps he will be deceived; then we can overcome him and take our revenge on him."
{Jer 20:10} 我听见了许多人的谗谤，四围都是惊吓；就是我知己的朋友也都窥探我，愿我跌倒，说：告他吧，我们也要告他！或者他被引诱，我们就能胜他，在他身上报仇。
{Jer 20:11} But the LORD is with me as a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble; they will not overcome me. They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. Their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten.
{Jer 20:11} 然而，耶和华与我同在，好像甚可怕的勇士。因此，逼迫我的必都绊跌，不能得胜；他们必大大蒙羞，就是受永不忘记的羞辱，因为他们行事没有智慧。
{Jer 20:12} O LORD of hosts, who tests the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance upon them, for to you have I committed my cause.
{Jer 20:12} 试验义人、察看人肺腑心肠的万军之耶和华啊，求你容我见你在他们身上报仇，因我将我的案件向你禀明了。
{Jer 20:13} Sing to the LORD; praise the LORD! For he has delivered the life of the needy from the hand of evildoers.
{Jer 20:13} 你们要向耶和华唱歌；赞美耶和华！因他救了穷人的性命脱离恶人的手。
{Jer 20:14} Cursed be the day on which I was born! The day when my mother bore me, let it not be blessed!
{Jer 20:14} 愿我生的那日受咒诅；愿我母亲产我的那日不蒙福！
{Jer 20:15} Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, "A son is born to you," making him very glad.
{Jer 20:15} 给我父亲报信说“你得了儿子”，使我父亲甚欢喜的，愿那人受咒诅。
{Jer 20:16} Let that man be like the cities that the LORD overthrew without pity; let him hear a cry in the morning and an alarm at noon,
{Jer 20:16} 愿那人像耶和华所倾覆而不后悔的城邑；愿他早晨听见哀声，晌午听见呐喊；
{Jer 20:17} because he did not kill me in the womb; so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb forever great.
{Jer 20:17} 因他在我未出胎的时候不杀我，使我母亲成了我的坟墓，胎就时常重大。
{Jer 20:18} Why did I come out from the womb to see toil and sorrow, and spend my days in shame?
{Jer 20:18} 我为何出胎见劳碌愁苦，使我的年日因羞愧消灭呢？
{Jer 21:1}  This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchiah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying,
{Jer 21:1}  耶和华的话临到耶利米。那时，西底家王打发玛基雅的儿子巴施户珥和玛西雅的儿子祭司西番雅去见耶利米，说：
{Jer 21:2}  "Inquire of the LORD for us, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war against us. Perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all his wonderful deeds and will make him withdraw from us."
{Jer 21:2}  “请你为我们求问耶和华；因为巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒来攻击我们，或者耶和华照他一切奇妙的作为待我们，使巴比伦王离开我们上去。”
{Jer 21:3}  Then Jeremiah said to them: "Thus you shall say to Zedekiah,
{Jer 21:3}  耶利米对他们说：“你们当对西底家这样说：
{Jer 21:4}  'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls. And I will bring them together into the midst of this city.
{Jer 21:4}  ‘耶和华以色列的神如此说：我要使你们手中的兵器，就是你们在城外与巴比伦王和围困你们的迦勒底人打仗的兵器翻转过来，又要使这些都聚集在这城中。
{Jer 21:5}  I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, in anger and in fury and in great wrath.
{Jer 21:5}  并且我要在怒气、忿怒，和大恼恨中，用伸出来的手，并大能的膀臂，亲自攻击你们；
{Jer 21:6}  And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast. They shall die of a great pestilence.
{Jer 21:6}  又要击打这城的居民，连人带牲畜都必遭遇大瘟疫死亡。
{Jer 21:7}  Afterward, declares the LORD, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people in this city who survive the pestilence, sword, and famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their lives. He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword. He shall not pity them or spare them or have compassion.'
{Jer 21:7}  以后我要将犹大王西底家和他的臣仆百姓，就是在城内，从瘟疫、刀剑、饥荒中剩下的人，都交在巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒的手中和他们仇敌，并寻索其命的人手中。巴比伦王必用刀击杀他们，不顾惜，不可怜，不怜悯。这是耶和华说的。’
{Jer 21:8}  "And to this people you shall say: 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
{Jer 21:8}  “你要对这百姓说：‘耶和华如此说：看哪，我将生命的路和死亡的路摆在你们面前。
{Jer 21:9}  He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live and shall have his life as a prize of war.
{Jer 21:9}  住在这城里的必遭刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫而死；但出去归降围困你们迦勒底人的必得存活，要以自己的命为掠物。
{Jer 21:10} For I have set my face against this city for harm and not for good, declares the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.'
{Jer 21:10} 耶和华说：我向这城变脸，降祸不降福；这城必交在巴比伦王的手中，他必用火焚烧。’”
{Jer 21:11} "And to the house of the king of Judah say, 'Hear the word of the LORD,
{Jer 21:11} “至于犹大王的家，你们当听耶和华的话。
{Jer 21:12} O house of David! Thus says the LORD: "'Execute justice in the morning, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of your evil deeds.'"
{Jer 21:12} 大卫家啊，耶和华如此说：你们每早晨要施行公平，拯救被抢夺的脱离欺压人的手，恐怕我的忿怒因你们的恶行发作，如火着起，甚至无人能以熄灭。
{Jer 21:13} "Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, O rock of the plain, declares the LORD; you who say, 'Who shall come down against us, or who shall enter our habitations?'
{Jer 21:13} 耶和华说：住山谷和平原磐石上的居民，你们说：谁能下来攻击我们？谁能进入我们的住处呢？看哪，我与你们为敌。
{Jer 21:14} I will punish you according to the fruit of your deeds, declares the LORD; I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is around her."
{Jer 21:14} 耶和华又说：我必按你们做事的结果刑罚你们；我也必使火在耶路撒冷的林中着起，将他四围所有的尽行烧灭。”
{Jer 22:1}  Thus says the LORD: "Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word,
{Jer 22:1}  耶和华如此说：“你下到犹大王的宫中，在那里说这话，
{Jer 22:2}  and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter these gates.
{Jer 22:2}  说：‘坐大卫宝座的犹大王啊，你和你的臣仆，并进入城门的百姓，都当听耶和华的话。
{Jer 22:3}  Thus says the LORD: Do justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And do no wrong or violence to the resident alien, the fatherless, and the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place.
{Jer 22:3}  耶和华如此说：你们要施行公平和公义，拯救被抢夺的脱离欺压人的手，不可亏负寄居的和孤儿寡妇，不可以强暴待他们，在这地方也不可流无辜人的血。
{Jer 22:4}  For if you will indeed obey this word, then there shall enter the gates of this house kings who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their servants and their people.
{Jer 22:4}  你们若认真行这事，就必有坐大卫宝座的君王和他的臣仆百姓，或坐车或骑马，从这城的各门进入。
{Jer 22:5}  But if you will not obey these words, I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.
{Jer 22:5}  你们若不听这些话，耶和华说：我指着自己起誓，这城必变为荒场。’
{Jer 22:6}  For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah: "'You are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon, yet surely I will make you a desert, an uninhabited city.
{Jer 22:6}  耶和华论到犹大王的家如此说：我看你如基列，如利巴嫩顶；然而，我必使你变为旷野，为无人居住的城邑。
{Jer 22:7}  I will prepare destroyers against you, each with his weapons, and they shall cut down your choicest cedars and cast them into the fire.
{Jer 22:7}  我要预备行毁灭的人，各拿器械攻击你；他们要砍下你佳美的香柏树，扔在火中。
{Jer 22:8}  "'And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to his neighbor, "Why has the LORD dealt thus with this great city?"
{Jer 22:8}  “许多国的民要经过这城，各人对邻舍说：‘耶和华为何向这大城如此行呢？’
{Jer 22:9}  And they will answer, "Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and worshiped other gods and served them."'"
{Jer 22:9}  他们必回答说：‘是因离弃了耶和华他们神的约，事奉敬拜别神。’”
{Jer 22:10} Weep not for him who is dead, nor grieve for him, but weep bitterly for him who goes away, for he shall return no more to see his native land.
{Jer 22:10} 不要为死人哭号；不要为他悲伤，却要为离家出外的人大大哭号；因为他不得再回来，也不得再见他的本国。
{Jer 22:11} For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went away from this place: "He shall return here no more,
{Jer 22:11} 因为耶和华论到从这地方出去的犹大王约西亚的儿子沙龙（在列王下二十三章三十节名约哈斯），就是接续他父亲约西亚作王的，这样说：“他必不得再回到这里来，
{Jer 22:12} but in the place where they have carried him captive, there shall he die, and he shall never see this land again."
{Jer 22:12} 却要死在被掳去的地方，必不得再见这地。”
{Jer 22:13} "Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his upper rooms by injustice, who makes his neighbor serve him for nothing and does not give him his wages,
{Jer 22:13} 那行不义盖房、行不公造楼、白白使用人的手工不给工价的有祸了！
{Jer 22:14} who says, 'I will build myself a great house with spacious upper rooms,' who cuts out windows for it, paneling it with cedar and painting it with vermilion.
{Jer 22:14} 他说：我要为自己盖广大的房、宽敞的楼，为自己开窗户。这楼房的护墙板是香柏木的，楼房是丹色油漆的。
{Jer 22:15} Do you think you are a king because you compete in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
{Jer 22:15} 难道你作王是在乎造香柏木楼房争胜吗？你的父亲岂不是也吃也喝、也施行公平和公义吗？那时他得了福乐。
{Jer 22:16} He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Is not this to know me? declares the LORD.
{Jer 22:16} 他为困苦和穷乏人伸冤，那时就得了福乐。认识我不在乎此吗？这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 22:17} But you have eyes and heart only for your dishonest gain, for shedding innocent blood, and for practicing oppression and violence."
{Jer 22:17} 惟有你的眼和你的心专顾贪婪，流无辜人的血，行欺压和强暴。
{Jer 22:18} Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: "They shall not lament for him, saying, 'Ah, my brother!' or 'Ah, sister!' They shall not lament for him, saying, 'Ah, lord!' or 'Ah, his majesty!'
{Jer 22:18} 所以，耶和华论到犹大王约西亚的儿子约雅敬如此说：人必不为他举哀说：哀哉！我的哥哥；或说：哀哉！我的姊姊；也不为他举哀说：哀哉！我的主；或说：哀哉！我主的荣华。
{Jer 22:19} With the burial of a donkey he shall be buried, dragged and dumped beyond the gates of Jerusalem."
{Jer 22:19} 他被埋葬，好像埋驴一样，要拉出去扔在耶路撒冷的城门之外。
{Jer 22:20} "Go up to Lebanon, and cry out, and lift up your voice in Bashan; cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers are destroyed.
{Jer 22:20} 你要上利巴嫩哀号，在巴珊扬声，从亚巴琳哀号，因为你所亲爱的都毁灭了。
{Jer 22:21} I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, 'I will not listen.' This has been your way from your youth, that you have not obeyed my voice.
{Jer 22:21} 你兴盛的时候，我对你说话；你却说：我不听。你自幼年以来总是这样，不听从我的话。
{Jer 22:22} The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity; then you will be ashamed and confounded because of all your evil.
{Jer 22:22} 你的牧人要被风吞吃，你所亲爱的必被掳去；那时你必因你一切的恶抱愧蒙羞。
{Jer 22:23} O inhabitant of Lebanon, nested among the cedars, how you will be pitied when pangs come upon you, pain as of a woman in labor!"
{Jer 22:23} 你这住利巴嫩、在香柏树上搭窝的，有痛苦临到你，好像疼痛临到产难的妇人，那时你何等可怜！
{Jer 22:24} "As I live, declares the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off
{Jer 22:24} 耶和华说：“犹大王约雅敬的儿子哥尼雅（又名耶哥尼雅；下同），虽是我右手上带印的戒指，我凭我的永生起誓，也必将你从其上摘下来，
{Jer 22:25} and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
{Jer 22:25} 并且我必将你交给寻索你命的人和你所惧怕的人手中，就是巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒和迦勒底人的手中。
{Jer 22:26} I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die.
{Jer 22:26} 我也必将你和生你的母亲赶到别国，并不是你们生的地方；你们必死在那里，
{Jer 22:27} But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not return."
{Jer 22:27} 但心中甚想归回之地，必不得归回。”
{Jer 22:28} Is this man Coniah a despised, broken pot, a vessel no one cares for? Why are he and his children hurled and cast into a land that they do not know?
{Jer 22:28} 哥尼雅这人是被轻看、破坏的器皿吗？是无人喜爱的器皿吗？他和他的后裔为何被赶到不认识之地呢？
{Jer 22:29} O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD!
{Jer 22:29} 地啊，地啊，地啊，当听耶和华的话！
{Jer 22:30} Thus says the LORD: "Write this man down as childless, a man who shall not succeed in his days, for none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah."
{Jer 22:30} 耶和华如此说：要写明这人算为无子，是平生不得亨通的；因为他后裔中再无一人得亨通，能坐在大卫的宝座上治理犹大。
{Jer 23:1}  "Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!" declares the LORD.
{Jer 23:1}  耶和华说：“那些残害、赶散我草场之羊的牧人有祸了！”
{Jer 23:2}  Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: "You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD.
{Jer 23:2}  耶和华以色列的神斥责那些牧养他百姓的牧人，如此说：“你们赶散我的羊群，并没有看顾他们；我必讨你们这行恶的罪。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 23:3}  Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
{Jer 23:3}  我要将我羊群中所余剩的，从我赶他们到的各国内招聚出来，领他们归回本圈；他们也必生养众多。
{Jer 23:4}  I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the LORD.
{Jer 23:4}  我必设立照管他们的牧人，牧养他们。他们不再惧怕，不再惊惶，也不缺少一个；这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 23:5}  "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
{Jer 23:5}  耶和华说：“日子将到，我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔；他必掌王权，行事有智慧，在地上施行公平和公义。
{Jer 23:6}  In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: 'The LORD is our righteousness.'
{Jer 23:6}  在他的日子，犹大必得救，以色列也安然居住。他的名必称为‘耶和华我们的义’。”
{Jer 23:7}  "Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when they shall no longer say, 'As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'
{Jer 23:7}  耶和华说：“日子将到，人必不再指着那领以色列人从埃及地上来永生的耶和华起誓，
{Jer 23:8}  but 'As the LORD lives who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.' Then they shall dwell in their own land."
{Jer 23:8}  却要指着那领以色列家的后裔从北方和赶他们到的各国中上来、永生的耶和华起誓。他们必住在本地。”
{Jer 23:9}  Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the LORD and because of his holy words.
{Jer 23:9}  论到那些先知，我心在我里面忧伤，我骨头都发颤；因耶和华和他的圣言，我像醉酒的人，像被酒所胜的人。
{Jer 23:10} For the land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land mourns, and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right.
{Jer 23:10} 地满了行淫的人！因妄自赌咒，地就悲哀；旷野的草场都枯干了。他们所行的道乃是恶的；他们的勇力使得不正。
{Jer 23:11} "Both prophet and priest are ungodly; even in my house I have found their evil, declares the LORD.
{Jer 23:11} 连先知带祭司都是亵渎的，就是在我殿中我也看见他们的恶。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 23:12} Therefore their way shall be to them like slippery paths in the darkness, into which they shall be driven and fall, for I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment, declares the LORD.
{Jer 23:12} 因此，他们的道路必像黑暗中的滑地，他们必被追赶，在这路中仆倒；因为当追讨之年，我必使灾祸临到他们。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 23:13} In the prophets of Samaria I saw an unsavory thing: they prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
{Jer 23:13} 我在撒玛利亚的先知中曾见愚妄；他们藉巴力说预言，使我的百姓以色列走错了路。
{Jer 23:14} But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his evil; all of them have become like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah."
{Jer 23:14} 我在耶路撒冷的先知中曾见可憎恶的事；他们行奸淫，做事虚妄，又坚固恶人的手，甚至无人回头离开他的恶。他们在我面前都像所多玛；耶路撒冷的居民都像蛾摩拉。
{Jer 23:15} Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: "Behold, I will feed them with bitter food and give them poisoned water to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land."
{Jer 23:15} 所以万军之耶和华论到先知如此说：我必将茵陈给他们吃，又将苦胆水给他们喝；因为亵渎的事出于耶路撒冷的先知，流行遍地。
{Jer 23:16} Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.
{Jer 23:16} 万军之耶和华如此说：“这些先知向你们说预言，你们不要听他们的话。他们以虚空教训你们，所说的异象是出于自己的心，不是出于耶和华的口。
{Jer 23:17} They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, 'It shall be well with you'; and to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, 'No disaster shall come upon you.'"
{Jer 23:17} 他们常对藐视我的人说：‘耶和华说：你们必享平安’；又对一切按自己顽梗之心而行的人说：‘必没有灾祸临到你们。’
{Jer 23:18} For who among them has stood in the council of the LORD to see and to hear his word, or who has paid attention to his word and listened?
{Jer 23:18} 有谁站在耶和华的会中得以听见并会悟他的话呢？有谁留心听他的话呢？
{Jer 23:19} Behold, the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
{Jer 23:19} 看哪！耶和华的忿怒好像暴风，已经发出；是暴烈的旋风，必转到恶人的头上。
{Jer 23:20} The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his heart. In the latter days you will understand it clearly.
{Jer 23:20} 耶和华的怒气必不转消，直到他心中所拟定的成就了。末后的日子你们要全然明白。
{Jer 23:21} "I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.
{Jer 23:21} 我没有打发那些先知，他们竟自奔跑；我没有对他们说话，他们竟自预言。
{Jer 23:22} But if they had stood in my council, then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their deeds.
{Jer 23:22} 他们若是站在我的会中，就必使我的百姓听我的话，又使他们回头离开恶道和他们所行的恶。
{Jer 23:23} "Am I a God at hand, declares the LORD, and not a God far away?
{Jer 23:23} 耶和华说：“我岂为近处的神呢？不也为远处的神吗？”
{Jer 23:24} Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD.
{Jer 23:24} 耶和华说：“人岂能在隐密处藏身，使我看不见他呢？”耶和华说：“我岂不充满天地吗？
{Jer 23:25} I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, 'I have dreamed, I have dreamed!'
{Jer 23:25} 我已听见那些先知所说的，就是托我名说的假预言，他们说我作了梦，我作了梦。
{Jer 23:26} How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,
{Jer 23:26} 说假预言的先知，就是预言本心诡诈的先知，他们这样存心要到几时呢？
{Jer 23:27} who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal?
{Jer 23:27} 他们各人将所做的梦对邻舍述说，想要使我的百姓忘记我的名，正如他们列祖因巴力忘记我的名一样。
{Jer 23:28} Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? declares the LORD.
{Jer 23:28} 得梦的先知可以述说那梦；得我话的人可以诚实讲说我的话。糠秕怎能与麦子比较呢？这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 23:29} Is not my word like fire, declares the LORD, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
{Jer 23:29} 耶和华说：“我的话岂不像火，又像能打碎磐石的大锤吗？”
{Jer 23:30} Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who steal my words from one another.
{Jer 23:30} 耶和华说：“那些先知各从邻舍偷窃我的言语，因此我必与他们反对。”
{Jer 23:31} Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who use their tongues and declare, 'declares the LORD.'
{Jer 23:31} 耶和华说：“那些先知用舌头，说是耶和华说的；我必与他们反对。”
{Jer 23:32} Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, declares the LORD, and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them. So they do not profit this people at all, declares the LORD.
{Jer 23:32} 耶和华说：“那些以幻梦为预言，又述说这梦，以谎言和矜夸使我百姓走错了路的，我必与他们反对。我没有打发他们，也没有吩咐他们。他们与这百姓毫无益处。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 23:33} "When one of this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, 'What is the burden of the LORD?' you shall say to them, 'You are the burden, and I will cast you off, declares the LORD.'
{Jer 23:33} “无论是百姓，是先知，是祭司，问你说：‘耶和华有什么默示呢？’你就对他们说：‘什么默示啊？耶和华说：我要撇弃你们。’
{Jer 23:34} And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, 'The burden of the LORD,' I will punish that man and his household.
{Jer 23:34} 无论是先知，是祭司，是百姓，说‘耶和华的默示’，我必刑罚那人和他的家。
{Jer 23:35} Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, 'What has the LORD answered?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?'
{Jer 23:35} 你们各人要对邻舍，各人要对弟兄如此说：‘耶和华回答什么？’‘耶和华说了什么呢？’
{Jer 23:36} But 'the burden of the LORD' you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man's own word, and you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God.
{Jer 23:36} ‘耶和华的默示’你们不可再提，各人所说的话必作自己的重担（重担和默示原文同），因为你们谬用永生神、万军之耶和华我们神的言语。
{Jer 23:37} Thus you shall say to the prophet, 'What has the LORD answered you?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?'
{Jer 23:37} 你们要对先知如此说：‘耶和华回答你什么？’‘耶和华说了什么呢？’
{Jer 23:38} But if you say, 'The burden of the LORD,' thus says the LORD, 'Because you have said these words, "The burden of the LORD," when I sent to you, saying, "You shall not say, 'The burden of the LORD,'"
{Jer 23:38} 你们若说‘耶和华的默示’，耶和华就如此说：‘因你们说“耶和华的默示”这句话，我也打发人到你们那里去，告诉你们不可说“耶和华的默示”。’
{Jer 23:39} therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers.
{Jer 23:39} 所以我必全然忘记你们，将你们和我所赐给你们并你们列祖的城撇弃了；
{Jer 23:40} And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.'"
{Jer 23:40} 又必使永远的凌辱和长久的羞耻临到你们，是不能忘记的。”
{Jer 24:1}  After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with the officials of Judah, the craftsmen, and the metal workers, and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me this vision: behold, two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the LORD.
{Jer 24:1}  巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒将犹大王约雅敬的儿子耶哥尼雅和犹大的首领，并工匠、铁匠从耶路撒冷掳去，带到巴比伦。这事以后，耶和华指给我看，有两筐无花果，放在耶和华的殿前。
{Jer 24:2}  One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.
{Jer 24:2}  一筐是极好的无花果，好像是初熟的；一筐是极坏的无花果，坏得不可吃。
{Jer 24:3}  And the LORD said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I said, "Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten."
{Jer 24:3}  于是耶和华问我说：“耶利米你看见什么？”我说：“我看见无花果，好的极好，坏的极坏，坏得不可吃。”
{Jer 24:4}  Then the word of the LORD came to me:
{Jer 24:4}  耶和华的话临到我说：“
{Jer 24:5}  "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
{Jer 24:5}  耶和华以色列的神如此说：被掳去的犹大人，就是我打发离开这地到迦勒底人之地去的，我必看顾他们如这好无花果，使他们得好处。
{Jer 24:6}  I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
{Jer 24:6}  我要眷顾他们，使他们得好处，领他们归回这地。我也要建立他们，必不拆毁；栽植他们，并不拔出。
{Jer 24:7}  I will give them a heart to know that I am the LORD, and they shall be my people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
{Jer 24:7}  我要赐他们认识我的心，知道我是耶和华。他们要作我的子民，我要作他们的神，因为他们要一心归向我。”
{Jer 24:8}  "But thus says the LORD: Like the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, so will I treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.
{Jer 24:8}  耶和华如此说：“我必将犹大王西底家和他的首领，以及剩在这地耶路撒冷的余民，并住在埃及地的犹大人都交出来，好像那极坏、坏得不可吃的无花果。
{Jer 24:9}  I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a reproach, a byword, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I shall drive them.
{Jer 24:9}  我必使他们交出来，在天下万国中抛来抛去，遭遇灾祸；在我赶逐他们到的各处成为凌辱、笑谈、讥刺、咒诅。
{Jer 24:10} And I will send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they shall be utterly destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers."
{Jer 24:10} 我必使刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫临到他们，直到他们从我所赐给他们和他们列祖之地灭绝。”
{Jer 25:1}  The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
{Jer 25:1}  犹大王约西亚的儿子约雅敬第四年，就是巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒的元年，耶和华论犹大众民的话临到耶利米。
{Jer 25:2}  which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
{Jer 25:2}  先知耶利米就将这话对犹大众人和耶路撒冷的一切居民说：
{Jer 25:3}  "For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken persistently to you, but you have not listened.
{Jer 25:3}  “从犹大王亚们的儿子约西亚十三年直到今日，这二十三年之内，常有耶和华的话临到我；我也对你们传说，就是从早起来传说，只是你们没有听从。
{Jer 25:4}  You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the LORD persistently sent to you all his servants the prophets,
{Jer 25:4}  耶和华也从早起来，差遣他的仆人众先知到你们这里来（只是你们没有听从，也没有侧耳而听），
{Jer 25:5}  saying, 'Turn now, every one of you, from his evil way and evil deeds, and dwell upon the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers from of old and forever.
{Jer 25:5}  说：‘你们各人当回头，离开恶道和所作的恶，便可居住耶和华古时所赐给你们和你们列祖之地，直到永远。
{Jer 25:6}  Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, or provoke me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.'
{Jer 25:6}  不可随从别神事奉敬拜，以你们手所做的惹我发怒；这样，我就不加害与你们。
{Jer 25:7}  Yet you have not listened to me, declares the LORD, that you might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.
{Jer 25:7}  然而你们没有听从我，竟以手所做的惹我发怒，陷害自己。这是耶和华说的。’”
{Jer 25:8}  "Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words,
{Jer 25:8}  所以万军之耶和华如此说：“因为你们没有听从我的话，
{Jer 25:9}  behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, declares the LORD, and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations. I will devote them to destruction, and make them a horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation.
{Jer 25:9}  我必召北方的众族和我仆人巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒来攻击这地和这地的居民，并四围一切的国民。我要将他们尽行灭绝，以致他们令人惊骇、嗤笑，并且永久荒凉。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 25:10} Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
{Jer 25:10} 我又要使欢喜和快乐的声音，新郎和新妇的声音，推磨的声音和灯的亮光，从他们中间止息。
{Jer 25:11} This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
{Jer 25:11} 这全地必然荒凉，令人惊骇。这些国民要服事巴比伦王七十年。
{Jer 25:12} Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the LORD, making the land an everlasting waste.
{Jer 25:12} 七十年满了以后，我必刑罚巴比伦王和那国民，并迦勒底人之地，因他们的罪孽使那地永远荒凉。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 25:13} I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against it, everything written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
{Jer 25:13} 我也必使我向那地所说的话，就是记在这书上的话，是耶利米向这些国民说的预言，都临到那地。
{Jer 25:14} For many nations and great kings shall make slaves even of them, and I will recompense them according to their deeds and the work of their hands."
{Jer 25:14} 因为有多国和大君王必使迦勒底人作奴仆；我也必照他们的行为，按他们手所做的报应他们。”
{Jer 25:15} Thus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: "Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
{Jer 25:15} 耶和华以色列的神对我如此说：“你从我手中接这杯忿怒的酒，使我所差遣你去的各国的民喝。
{Jer 25:16} They shall drink and stagger and be crazed because of the sword that I am sending among them."
{Jer 25:16} 他们喝了就要东倒西歪，并要发狂，因我使刀剑临到他们中间。”
{Jer 25:17} So I took the cup from the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to whom the LORD sent me drink it:
{Jer 25:17} 我就从耶和华的手中接了这杯，给耶和华所差遣我去的各国的民喝，
{Jer 25:18} Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a desolation and a waste, a hissing and a curse, as at this day;
{Jer 25:18} 就是耶路撒冷和犹大的城邑，并耶路撒冷的君王与首领，使这城邑荒凉，令人惊骇、嗤笑、咒诅，正如今日一样。
{Jer 25:19} Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, all his people,
{Jer 25:19} 又有埃及王法老和他的臣仆、首领，以及他的众民，
{Jer 25:20} and all the mixed tribes among them; all the kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the land of the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod);
{Jer 25:20} 并杂族的人民和乌斯地的诸王，与非利士地的诸王（亚实基伦、迦萨、以革伦，以及亚实突剩下的人）；
{Jer 25:21} Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon;
{Jer 25:21} 以东、摩押、亚扪人、
{Jer 25:22} all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastland across the sea;
{Jer 25:22} 推罗的诸王、西顿的诸王、海岛的诸王、
{Jer 25:23} Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair;
{Jer 25:23} 底但、提玛、布斯，和一切剃周围头发的；
{Jer 25:24} all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert;
{Jer 25:24} 亚拉伯的诸王、住旷野杂族人民的诸王、
{Jer 25:25} all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;
{Jer 25:25} 心利的诸王、以拦的诸王、玛代的诸王、
{Jer 25:26} all the kings of the north, far and near, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the face of the earth. And after them the king of Babylon shall drink.
{Jer 25:26} 北方远近的诸王，以及天下地上的万国喝了，以后示沙克（就是巴比伦）王也要喝。
{Jer 25:27} "Then you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink, be drunk and vomit, fall and rise no more, because of the sword that I am sending among you.'
{Jer 25:27} “你要对他们说：‘万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：你们要喝，且要喝醉，要呕吐，且要跌倒，不得再起来，都因我使刀剑临到你们中间。’
{Jer 25:28} "And if they refuse to accept the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: You must drink!
{Jer 25:28} “他们若不肯从你手接这杯喝，你就要对他们说：‘万军之耶和华如此说：你们一定要喝！
{Jer 25:29} For behold, I begin to work disaster at the city that is called by my name, and shall you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, declares the LORD of hosts.'
{Jer 25:29} 我既从称为我名下的城起首施行灾祸，你们能尽免刑罚吗？你们必不能免，因为我要命刀剑临到地上一切的居民。这是万军之耶和华说的。’
{Jer 25:30} "You, therefore, shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: "'The LORD will roar from on high, and from his holy habitation utter his voice; he will roar mightily against his fold, and shout, like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
{Jer 25:30} “所以你要向他们预言这一切的话，攻击他们，说：耶和华必从高天吼叫，从圣所发声，向自己的羊群大声吼叫；他要向地上一切的居民呐喊，像踹葡萄的一样。
{Jer 25:31} The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth, for the LORD has an indictment against the nations; he is entering into judgment with all flesh, and the wicked he will put to the sword, declares the LORD.'
{Jer 25:31} 必有响声达到地极，因为耶和华与列国相争；凡有血气的，他必审问；至于恶人，他必交给刀剑。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 25:32} "Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, disaster is going forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth!
{Jer 25:32} 万军之耶和华如此说：看哪，必有灾祸从这国发到那国，并有大暴风从地极刮起。
{Jer 25:33} "And those pierced by the LORD on that day shall extend from one end of the earth to the other. They shall not be lamented, or gathered, or buried; they shall be dung on the surface of the ground.
{Jer 25:33} “到那日，从地这边直到地那边都有耶和华所杀戮的。必无人哀哭，不得收殓，不得葬埋，必在地上成为粪土。
{Jer 25:34} "Wail, you shepherds, and cry out, and roll in ashes, you lords of the flock, for the days of your slaughter and dispersion have come, and you shall fall like a choice vessel.
{Jer 25:34} 牧人哪，你们当哀号，呼喊；群众的头目啊，你们要滚在灰中；因为你们被杀戮分散的日子足足来到。你们要跌碎，好像美器打碎一样。
{Jer 25:35} No refuge will remain for the shepherds, nor escape for the lords of the flock.
{Jer 25:35} 牧人无路逃跑；群众的头目也无法逃脱。
{Jer 25:36} A voice--the cry of the shepherds, and the wail of the lords of the flock! For the LORD is laying waste their pasture,
{Jer 25:36} 听啊，有牧人呼喊，有群众头目哀号的声音，因为耶和华使他们的草场变为荒场。
{Jer 25:37} and the peaceful folds are devastated because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
{Jer 25:37} 耶和华发出猛烈的怒气，平安的羊圈就都寂静无声。
{Jer 25:38} Like a lion he has left his lair, for their land has become a waste because of the sword of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger."
{Jer 25:38} 他离了隐密处像狮子一样，他们的地，因刀剑凶猛的欺压，又因他猛烈的怒气都成为可惊骇的。”
{Jer 26:1}  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD:
{Jer 26:1}  犹大王约西亚的儿子约雅敬登基的时候，有这话从耶和华临到耶利米说：
{Jer 26:2}  "Thus says the LORD: Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the LORD all the words that I command you to speak to them; do not hold back a word.
{Jer 26:2}  “耶和华如此说：你站在耶和华殿的院内，对犹大众城邑的人，就是到耶和华殿来礼拜的，说我所吩咐你的一切话，一字不可删减。
{Jer 26:3}  It may be they will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, that I may relent of the disaster that I intend to do to them because of their evil deeds.
{Jer 26:3}  或者他们肯听从，各人回头离开恶道，使我后悔不将我因他们所行的恶，想要施行的灾祸降与他们。
{Jer 26:4}  You shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you,
{Jer 26:4}  你要对他们说，耶和华如此说：‘你们若不听从我，不遵行我设立在你们面前的律法，
{Jer 26:5}  and to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently, though you have not listened,
{Jer 26:5}  不听我从早起来差遣到你们那里去我仆人众先知的话（你们还是没有听从），
{Jer 26:6}  then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.'"
{Jer 26:6}  我就必使这殿如示罗，使这城为地上万国所咒诅的。’”
{Jer 26:7}  The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
{Jer 26:7}  耶利米在耶和华殿中说的这些话，祭司、先知与众民都听见了。
{Jer 26:8}  And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, "You shall die!
{Jer 26:8}  耶利米说完了耶和华所吩咐他对众人说的一切话，祭司、先知与众民都来抓住他，说：“你必要死！
{Jer 26:9}  Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, 'This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant'?" And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
{Jer 26:9}  你为何托耶和华的名预言，说这殿必如示罗，这城必变为荒场无人居住呢？”于是众民都在耶和华的殿中聚集到耶利米那里。
{Jer 26:10} When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and took their seat in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the LORD.
{Jer 26:10} 犹大的首领听见这事，就从王宫上到耶和华的殿，坐在耶和华殿的新门口。
{Jer 26:11} Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, "This man deserves the sentence of death, because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears."
{Jer 26:11} 祭司、先知对首领和众民说：“这人是该死的；因为他说预言攻击这城，正如你们亲耳所听见的。”
{Jer 26:12} Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard.
{Jer 26:12} 耶利米就对众首领和众民说：“耶和华差遣我预言，攻击这殿和这城，说你们所听见的这一切话。
{Jer 26:13} Now therefore mend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will relent of the disaster that he has pronounced against you.
{Jer 26:13} 现在要改正你们的行动作为，听从耶和华你们神的话，他就必后悔，不将所说的灾祸降与你们。
{Jer 26:14} But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you.
{Jer 26:14} 至于我，我在你们手中，你们眼看何为善，何为正，就那样待我吧！
{Jer 26:15} Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears."
{Jer 26:15} 但你们要确实地知道，若把我治死，就使无辜人的血归到你们和这城，并其中的居民了；因为耶和华实在差遣我到你们这里来，将这一切话传与你们耳中。”
{Jer 26:16} Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God."
{Jer 26:16} 首领和众民就对祭司、先知说：“这人是不该死的，因为他是奉耶和华我们神的名向我们说话。”
{Jer 26:17} And certain of the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled people, saying,
{Jer 26:17} 国中的长老就有几个人起来，对聚会的众民说：
{Jer 26:18} "Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and said to all the people of Judah: 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "'Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.'
{Jer 26:18} “当犹大王希西家的日子，有摩利沙人弥迦对犹大众人预言说：万军之耶和华如此说：锡安必被耕种像一块田；耶路撒冷必变为乱堆；这殿的山必像丛林的高处。
{Jer 26:19} Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and did not the LORD relent of the disaster that he had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great disaster upon ourselves."
{Jer 26:19} 犹大王希西家和犹大众人岂是把他治死呢？希西家岂不是敬畏耶和华、恳求他的恩吗？耶和华就后悔，不把自己所说的灾祸降与他们。若治死这人，我们就作了大恶，自害己命。”
{Jer 26:20} There was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like those of Jeremiah.
{Jer 26:20} （又有一个人奉耶和华的名说预言，是基列耶琳人示玛雅的儿子乌利亚，他照耶利米的一切话说预言，攻击这城和这地。
{Jer 26:21} And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the officials, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt.
{Jer 26:21} 约雅敬王和他众勇士、众首领听见了乌利亚的话，王就想要把他治死。乌利亚听见就惧怕，逃往埃及去了。
{Jer 26:22} Then King Jehoiakim sent to Egypt certain men, Elnathan the son of Achbor and others with him,
{Jer 26:22} 约雅敬王便打发亚革波的儿子以利拿单，带领几个人往埃及去。
{Jer 26:23} and they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who struck him down with the sword and dumped his dead body into the burial place of the common people.
{Jer 26:23} 他们就从埃及将乌利亚带出来，送到约雅敬王那里；王用刀杀了他，把他的尸首抛在平民的坟地中。）
{Jer 26:24} But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over to the people to be put to death.
{Jer 26:24} 然而，沙番的儿子亚希甘保护耶利米，不交在百姓的手中治死他。
{Jer 27:1}  In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD.
{Jer 27:1}  犹大王约西亚的儿子约雅敬（约雅敬是西底家的别名，看第三节）登基的时候，有这话从耶和华临到耶利米说：
{Jer 27:2}  Thus the LORD said to me: "Make yourself straps and yoke-bars, and put them on your neck.
{Jer 27:2}  “耶和华对我如此说：你做绳索与轭，加在自己的颈项上，
{Jer 27:3}  Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the sons of Ammon, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
{Jer 27:3}  藉那些来到耶路撒冷见犹大王西底家的使臣之手，把绳索与轭送到以东王、摩押王、亚扪王、推罗王、西顿王那里，
{Jer 27:4}  Give them this charge for their masters: 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters:
{Jer 27:4}  且嘱咐使臣，传与他们的主人说，万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：
{Jer 27:5}  "It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth, with the men and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever it seems right to me.
{Jer 27:5}  我用大能和伸出来的膀臂，创造大地和地上的人民、牲畜。我看给谁相宜，就把地给谁。
{Jer 27:6}  Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him.
{Jer 27:6}  现在我将这些地都交给我仆人巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒的手，我也将田野的走兽给他使用。
{Jer 27:7}  All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.
{Jer 27:7}  列国都必服事他和他的儿孙，直到他本国遭报的日期来到。那时，多国和大君王要使他作他们的奴仆。
{Jer 27:8}  "'"But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, declares the LORD, until I have consumed it by his hand.
{Jer 27:8}  “无论哪一邦哪一国，不肯服事这巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒，也不把颈项放在巴比伦王的轭下，我必用刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫刑罚那邦，直到我藉巴比伦王的手将他们毁灭。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 27:9}  So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your fortune-tellers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon.'
{Jer 27:9}  至于你们，不可听从你们的先知和占卜的、圆梦的、观兆的，以及行邪术的；他们告诉你们说：‘你们不至服事巴比伦王。’
{Jer 27:10} For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will perish.
{Jer 27:10} 他们向你们说假预言，要叫你们迁移，远离本地，以致我将你们赶出去，使你们灭亡。
{Jer 27:11} But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to work it and dwell there, declares the LORD."'"
{Jer 27:11} 但哪一邦肯把颈项放在巴比伦王的轭下服事他，我必使那邦仍在本地存留，得以耕种居住。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 27:12} To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: "Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people and live.
{Jer 27:12} 我就照这一切的话对犹大王西底家说：“要把你们的颈项放在巴比伦王的轭下，服事他和他的百姓，便得存活。
{Jer 27:13} Why will you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as the LORD has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
{Jer 27:13} 你和你的百姓为何要因刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫死亡，正如耶和华论到不服事巴比伦王的那国说的话呢？
{Jer 27:14} Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon,' for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.
{Jer 27:14} 不可听那些先知对你们所说的话；他们说：‘你们不至服事巴比伦王’，其实他们向你们说假预言。
{Jer 27:15} I have not sent them, declares the LORD, but they are prophesying falsely in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you."
{Jer 27:15} 耶和华说：‘我并没有打发他们，他们却托我的名说假预言，好使我将你们和向你们说预言的那些先知赶出去，一同灭亡。’”
{Jer 27:16} Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, 'Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon,' for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.
{Jer 27:16} 我又对祭司和这众民说：“耶和华如此说：你们不可听那先知对你们所说的预言。他们说：‘耶和华殿中的器皿快要从巴比伦带回来’；其实他们向你们说假预言。
{Jer 27:17} Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a desolation?
{Jer 27:17} 不可听从他们，只管服事巴比伦王便得存活。这城何致变为荒场呢？
{Jer 27:18} If they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, then let them intercede with the LORD of hosts, that the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon.
{Jer 27:18} 他们若果是先知，有耶和华的话临到他们，让他们祈求万军之耶和华，使那在耶和华殿中和犹大王宫内，并耶路撒冷剩下的器皿，不被带到巴比伦去。
{Jer 27:19} For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
{Jer 27:19} （因为万军之耶和华论到柱子、铜海、盆座，并剩在这城里的器皿，
{Jer 27:20} which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away, when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem--
{Jer 27:20} 就是巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒掳掠犹大王约雅敬的儿子耶哥尼雅，和犹大、耶路撒冷一切贵胄的时候所没有掠去的器皿。）
{Jer 27:21} thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
{Jer 27:21} 论到那在耶和华殿中和犹大王宫内，并耶路撒冷剩下的器皿，万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：
{Jer 27:22} They shall be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when I visit them, declares the LORD. Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place."
{Jer 27:22} 必被带到巴比伦存在那里，直到我眷顾以色列人的日子。那时，我必将这器皿带回来，交还此地。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 28:1}  In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,
{Jer 28:1}  当年，就是犹大王西底家登基第四年五月，基遍人押朔的儿子，先知哈拿尼雅，在耶和华的殿中当着祭司和众民对我说：
{Jer 28:2}  "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
{Jer 28:2}  “万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：我已经折断巴比伦王的轭。
{Jer 28:3}  Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.
{Jer 28:3}  二年之内，我要将巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒从这地掠到巴比伦的器皿，就是耶和华殿中的一切器皿都带回此地。
{Jer 28:4}  I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, declares the LORD, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."
{Jer 28:4}  我又要将犹大王约雅敬的儿子耶哥尼雅和被掳到巴比伦去的一切犹大人带回此地，因为我要折断巴比伦王的轭。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 28:5}  Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD,
{Jer 28:5}  先知耶利米当着祭司和站在耶和华殿里的众民对先知哈拿尼雅说：
{Jer 28:6}  and the prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD make the words that you have prophesied come true, and bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the house of the LORD, and all the exiles.
{Jer 28:6}  “阿们！愿耶和华如此行，愿耶和华成就你所预言的话，将耶和华殿中的器皿和一切被掳去的人从巴比伦带回此地。
{Jer 28:7}  Yet hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
{Jer 28:7}  然而我向你和众民耳中所要说的话，你应当听。
{Jer 28:8}  The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms.
{Jer 28:8}  从古以来，在你我以前的先知，向多国和大邦说预言，论到争战、灾祸、瘟疫的事。
{Jer 28:9}  As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then it will be known that the LORD has truly sent the prophet."
{Jer 28:9}  先知预言的平安，到话语成就的时候，人便知道他真是耶和华所差来的。”
{Jer 28:10} Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke them.
{Jer 28:10} 于是，先知哈拿尼雅将先知耶利米颈项上的轭取下来，折断了。
{Jer 28:11} And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years." But Jeremiah the prophet went his way.
{Jer 28:11} 哈拿尼雅又当着众民说：“耶和华如此说：二年之内我必照样从列国人的颈项上折断巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒的轭。”于是先知耶利米就走了。
{Jer 28:12} Sometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
{Jer 28:12} 先知哈拿尼雅把先知耶利米颈项上的轭折断以后，耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 28:13} "Go, tell Hananiah, 'Thus says the LORD: You have broken wooden bars, but you have made in their place bars of iron.
{Jer 28:13} “你去告诉哈拿尼雅说，耶和华如此说：你折断木轭，却换了铁轭！
{Jer 28:14} For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations an iron yoke to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him, for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.'"
{Jer 28:14} 因为万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：我已将铁轭加在这些国的颈项上，使他们服事巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒，他们总要服事他；我也把田野的走兽给了他。”
{Jer 28:15} And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie.
{Jer 28:15} 于是先知耶利米对先知哈拿尼雅说：“哈拿尼雅啊，你应当听！耶和华并没有差遣你，你竟使这百姓倚靠谎言。
{Jer 28:16} Therefore thus says the LORD: 'Behold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, because you have uttered rebellion against the LORD.'"
{Jer 28:16} 所以耶和华如此说：看哪，我要叫你去世，你今年必死，因为你向耶和华说了叛逆的话。”
{Jer 28:17} In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah died.
{Jer 28:17} 这样，先知哈拿尼雅当年七月间就死了。
{Jer 29:1}  These are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders of the exiles, and to the priests, the prophets, and all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
{Jer 29:1}  先知耶利米从耶路撒冷寄信与被掳的祭司、先知，和众民，并生存的长老，就是尼布甲尼撒从耶路撒冷掳到巴比伦去的。
{Jer 29:2}  This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had departed from Jerusalem.
{Jer 29:2}  （这在耶哥尼雅王和太后、太监，并犹大、耶路撒冷的首领，以及工匠、铁匠都离了耶路撒冷以后。）
{Jer 29:3}  The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said:
{Jer 29:3}  他藉沙番的儿子以利亚萨和希勒家的儿子基玛利的手寄去。他们二人是犹大王西底家打发往巴比伦去见尼布甲尼撒王的。
{Jer 29:4}  "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
{Jer 29:4}  信上说：“万军之耶和华以色列的神对一切被掳去的（就是我使他们从耶路撒冷被掳到巴比伦的人）如此说：
{Jer 29:5}  Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.
{Jer 29:5}  你们要盖造房屋，住在其中；栽种田园，吃其中所产的；
{Jer 29:6}  Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease.
{Jer 29:6}  娶妻生儿女，为你们的儿子娶妻，使你们的女儿嫁人，生儿养女。在那里生养众多，不至减少。
{Jer 29:7}  But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.
{Jer 29:7}  我所使你们被掳到的那城，你们要为那城求平安，为那城祷告耶和华；因为那城得平安，你们也随着得平安。
{Jer 29:8}  For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they dream,
{Jer 29:8}  万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：不要被你们中间的先知和占卜的诱惑，也不要听信自己所做的梦；
{Jer 29:9}  for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send them, declares the LORD.
{Jer 29:9}  因为他们托我的名对你们说假预言，我并没有差遣他们。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 29:10} "For thus says the LORD: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place.
{Jer 29:10} “耶和华如此说：为巴比伦所定的七十年满了以后，我要眷顾你们，向你们成就我的恩言，使你们仍回此地。
{Jer 29:11} For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.
{Jer 29:11} 耶和华说：我知道我向你们所怀的意念是赐平安的意念，不是降灾祸的意念，要叫你们末后有指望。
{Jer 29:12} Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you.
{Jer 29:12} 你们要呼求我，祷告我，我就应允你们。
{Jer 29:13} You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.
{Jer 29:13} 你们寻求我，若专心寻求我，就必寻见。
{Jer 29:14} I will be found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, declares the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.
{Jer 29:14} 耶和华说：我必被你们寻见，我也必使你们被掳的人归回，将你们从各国中和我所赶你们到的各处招聚了来，又将你们带回我使你们被掳掠离开的地方。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 29:15} "Because you have said, 'The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,'
{Jer 29:15} “你们说：‘耶和华在巴比伦为我们兴起先知’；
{Jer 29:16} thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your kinsmen who did not go out with you into exile:
{Jer 29:16} 所以耶和华论到坐大卫宝座的王和住在这城里的一切百姓，就是未曾与你们一同被掳的弟兄，
{Jer 29:17} 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, behold, I am sending on them sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like vile figs that are so rotten they cannot be eaten.
{Jer 29:17} 万军之耶和华如此说：‘看哪，我必使刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫临到他们，使他们像极坏的无花果，坏得不可吃。
{Jer 29:18} I will pursue them with sword, famine, and pestilence, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, a terror, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,
{Jer 29:18} 我必用刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫追赶他们，使他们在天下万国抛来抛去，在我所赶他们到的各国中，令人咒诅、惊骇、嗤笑、羞辱。
{Jer 29:19} because they did not pay attention to my words, declares the LORD, that I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets, but you would not listen, declares the LORD.'
{Jer 29:19} 耶和华说：这是因为他们没有听从我的话，就是我从早起来差遣我仆人众先知去说的，无奈他们不听。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 29:20} Hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
{Jer 29:20} 所以你们一切被掳去的，就是我从耶路撒冷打发到巴比伦去的，当听耶和华的话。’”
{Jer 29:21} 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall strike them down before your eyes.
{Jer 29:21} 万军之耶和华以色列的神论到哥赖雅的儿子亚哈，并玛西雅的儿子西底家，如此说：“他们是托我名向你们说假预言的，我必将他们交在巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒的手中；他要在你们眼前杀害他们。
{Jer 29:22} Because of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: "The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,"
{Jer 29:22} 住巴比伦一切被掳的犹大人必藉这二人赌咒说：‘愿耶和华使你像巴比伦王在火中烧的西底家和亚哈一样。’
{Jer 29:23} because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel, they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them. I am the one who knows, and I am witness, declares the LORD.'"
{Jer 29:23} 这二人是在以色列中行了丑事，与邻舍的妻行淫，又假托我名说我未曾吩咐他们的话。知道的是我，作见证的也是我。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 29:24} To Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say:
{Jer 29:24} “论到尼希兰人示玛雅，你当说，
{Jer 29:25} "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
{Jer 29:25} 万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：你曾用自己的名寄信给耶路撒冷的众民和祭司玛西雅的儿子西番雅，并众祭司，说：
{Jer 29:26} 'The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have charge in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and neck irons.
{Jer 29:26} ‘耶和华已经立你西番雅为祭司，代替祭司耶何耶大，使耶和华殿中有官长，好将一切狂妄自称为先知的人用枷枷住，用锁锁住。
{Jer 29:27} Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who is prophesying to you?
{Jer 29:27} 现在亚拿突人耶利米向你们自称为先知，你们为何没有责备他呢？
{Jer 29:28} For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, "Your exile will be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce."'"
{Jer 29:28} 因为他寄信给我们在巴比伦的人说：被掳的事必长久。你们要盖造房屋，住在其中；栽种田园，吃其中所产的。’”
{Jer 29:29} Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
{Jer 29:29} 祭司西番雅就把这信念给先知耶利米听。
{Jer 29:30} Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
{Jer 29:30} 于是耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 29:31} "Send to all the exiles, saying, 'Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah had prophesied to you when I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie,
{Jer 29:31} “你当寄信给一切被掳的人说：‘耶和华论到尼希兰人示玛雅说：因为示玛雅向你们说预言，我并没有差遣他，他使你们倚靠谎言；
{Jer 29:32} therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants. He shall not have anyone living among this people, and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, declares the LORD, for he has spoken rebellion against the LORD.'"
{Jer 29:32} 所以耶和华如此说：我必刑罚尼希兰人示玛雅和他的后裔，他必无一人存留住在这民中，也不得见我所要赐与我百姓的福乐，因为他向耶和华说了叛逆的话。这是耶和华说的。’”
{Jer 30:1}  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
{Jer 30:1}  耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 30:2}  "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you.
{Jer 30:2}  “耶和华以色列的神如此说：你将我对你说过的一切话都写在书上。
{Jer 30:3}  For behold, days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel and Judah, says the LORD, and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall take possession of it."
{Jer 30:3}  耶和华说：日子将到，我要使我的百姓以色列和犹大被掳的人归回；我也要使他们回到我所赐给他们列祖之地，他们就得这地为业。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 30:4}  These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah:
{Jer 30:4}  以下是耶和华论到以色列和犹大所说的话：
{Jer 30:5}  "Thus says the LORD: We have heard a cry of panic, of terror, and no peace.
{Jer 30:5}  耶和华如此说：我们听见声音，是战抖惧怕而不平安的声音。
{Jer 30:6}  Ask now, and see, can a man bear a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor? Why has every face turned pale?
{Jer 30:6}  你们且访问看看，男人有产难吗？我怎么看见人人用手掐腰，像产难的妇人，脸面都变青了呢？
{Jer 30:7}  Alas! That day is so great there is none like it; it is a time of distress for Jacob; yet he shall be saved out of it.
{Jer 30:7}  哀哉！那日为大，无日可比；这是雅各遭难的时候，但他必被救出来。
{Jer 30:8}  "And it shall come to pass in that day, declares the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and I will burst your bonds, and foreigners shall no more make a servant of him.
{Jer 30:8}  万军之耶和华说：“到那日，我必从你颈项上折断仇敌的轭，扭开他的绳索；外邦人不得再使你作他们的奴仆。
{Jer 30:9}  But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
{Jer 30:9}  你们却要事奉耶和华你们的神和我为你们所要兴起的王大卫。”
{Jer 30:10} "Then fear not, O Jacob my servant, declares the LORD, nor be dismayed, O Israel; for behold, I will save you from far away, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, and none shall make him afraid.
{Jer 30:10} 故此，耶和华说：我的仆人雅各啊，不要惧怕；以色列啊，不要惊惶；因我要从远方拯救你，从被掳到之地拯救你的后裔；雅各必回来得享平靖安逸，无人使他害怕。
{Jer 30:11} For I am with you to save you, declares the LORD; I will make a full end of all the nations among whom I scattered you, but of you I will not make a full end. I will discipline you in just measure, and I will by no means leave you unpunished.
{Jer 30:11} 因我与你同在，要拯救你，也要将所赶散你到的那些国灭绝净尽，却不将你灭绝净尽，倒要从宽惩治你，万不能不罚你（不罚你：或作以你为无罪）。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 30:12} "For thus says the LORD: Your hurt is incurable, and your wound is grievous.
{Jer 30:12} 耶和华如此说：你的损伤无法医治；你的伤痕极其重大。
{Jer 30:13} There is none to uphold your cause, no medicine for your wound, no healing for you.
{Jer 30:13} 无人为你分诉，使你的伤痕得以缠裹；你没有医治的良药。
{Jer 30:14} All your lovers have forgotten you; they care nothing for you; for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy, the punishment of a merciless foe, because your guilt is great, because your sins are flagrant.
{Jer 30:14} 你所亲爱的都忘记你，不来探问（或作：理会）你。我因你的罪孽甚大，罪恶众多，曾用仇敌加的伤害伤害你，用残忍者的惩治惩治你。
{Jer 30:15} Why do you cry out over your hurt? Your pain is incurable. Because your guilt is great, because your sins are flagrant, I have done these things to you.
{Jer 30:15} 你为何因损伤哀号呢？你的痛苦无法医治。我因你的罪孽甚大，罪恶众多，曾将这些加在你身上。
{Jer 30:16} Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured, and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity; those who plunder you shall be plundered, and all who prey on you I will make a prey.
{Jer 30:16} 故此，凡吞吃你的必被吞吃；你的敌人个个都被掳去；掳掠你的必成为掳物；抢夺你的必成为掠物。
{Jer 30:17} For I will restore health to you, and your wounds I will heal, declares the LORD, because they have called you an outcast: 'It is Zion, for whom no one cares!'
{Jer 30:17} 耶和华说：我必使你痊愈，医好你的伤痕，都因人称你为被赶散的，说：这是锡安，无人来探问（或作：理会）的！
{Jer 30:18} "Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and have compassion on his dwellings; the city shall be rebuilt on its mound, and the palace shall stand where it used to be.
{Jer 30:18} 耶和华如此说：我必使雅各被掳去的帐棚归回，也必顾惜他的住处。城必建造在原旧的山冈；宫殿也照旧有人居住。
{Jer 30:19} Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving, and the voices of those who celebrate. I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will make them honored, and they shall not be small.
{Jer 30:19} 必有感谢和欢乐的声音从其中发出，我要使他们增多，不至减少；使他们尊荣，不至卑微。
{Jer 30:20} Their children shall be as they were of old, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all who oppress them.
{Jer 30:20} 他们的儿女要如往日；他们的会众坚立在我面前；凡欺压他们的，我必刑罚他。
{Jer 30:21} Their prince shall be one of themselves; their ruler shall come out from their midst; I will make him draw near, and he shall approach me, for who would dare of himself to approach me? declares the LORD.
{Jer 30:21} 他们的君王必是属乎他们的；掌权的必从他们中间而出。我要使他就近我，他也要亲近我；不然，谁有胆量亲近我呢？这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 30:22} And you shall be my people, and I will be your God."
{Jer 30:22} 你们要作我的子民，我要作你们的神。
{Jer 30:23} Behold the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
{Jer 30:23} 看哪，耶和华的忿怒好像暴风已经发出；是扫灭的暴风，必转到恶人的头上。
{Jer 30:24} The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intentions of his mind. In the latter days you will understand this.
{Jer 30:24} 耶和华的烈怒必不转消，直到他心中所拟定的成就了；末后的日子你们要明白。
{Jer 31:1}  "At that time, declares the LORD, I will be the God of all the clans of Israel, and they shall be my people."
{Jer 31:1}  耶和华说：“那时，我必作以色列各家的神；他们必作我的子民。”
{Jer 31:2}  Thus says the LORD: "The people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness; when Israel sought for rest,
{Jer 31:2}  耶和华如此说：脱离刀剑的就是以色列人。我使他享安息的时候，他曾在旷野蒙恩。
{Jer 31:3}  the LORD appeared to him from far away. I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you.
{Jer 31:3}  古时（或作：从远方）耶和华向以色列（原文作我）显现，说：我以永远的爱爱你，因此我以慈爱吸引你。
{Jer 31:4}  Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin Israel! Again you shall adorn yourself with tambourines and shall go forth in the dance of the merrymakers.
{Jer 31:4}  以色列的民（原文作处女）哪，我要再建立你，你就被建立；你必再以击鼓为美，与欢乐的人一同跳舞而出；
{Jer 31:5}  Again you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant and shall enjoy the fruit.
{Jer 31:5}  又必在撒玛利亚的山上栽种葡萄园，栽种的人要享用所结的果子。
{Jer 31:6}  For there shall be a day when watchmen will call in the hill country of Ephraim: 'Arise, and let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God.'"
{Jer 31:6}  日子必到，以法莲山上守望的人必呼叫说：起来吧！我们可以上锡安，到耶和华我们的神那里去。
{Jer 31:7}  For thus says the LORD: "Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, and raise shouts for the chief of the nations; proclaim, give praise, and say, 'O LORD, save your people, the remnant of Israel.'
{Jer 31:7}  耶和华如此说：你们当为雅各欢乐歌唱，因万国中为首的欢呼。当传扬颂赞说：耶和华啊，求你拯救你的百姓以色列所剩下的人。
{Jer 31:8}  Behold, I will bring them from the north country and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth, among them the blind and the lame, the pregnant woman and she who is in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here.
{Jer 31:8}  我必将他们从北方领来，从地极招聚；同着他们来的有瞎子、瘸子、孕妇、产妇；他们必成为大帮回到这里来。
{Jer 31:9}  With weeping they shall come, and with pleas for mercy I will lead them back, I will make them walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not stumble, for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
{Jer 31:9}  他们要哭泣而来。我要照他们恳求的引导他们，使他们在河水旁走正直的路，在其上不至绊跌；因为我是以色列的父，以法莲是我的长子。
{Jer 31:10} "Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away; say, 'He who scattered Israel will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.'
{Jer 31:10} 列国啊，要听耶和华的话，传扬在远处的海岛说：赶散以色列的必招聚他，又看守他，好像牧人看守羊群。
{Jer 31:11} For the LORD has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.
{Jer 31:11} 因耶和华救赎了雅各，救赎他脱离比他更强之人的手。
{Jer 31:12} They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion, and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the LORD, over the grain, the wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd; their life shall be like a watered garden, and they shall languish no more.
{Jer 31:12} 他们要来到锡安的高处歌唱，又流归耶和华施恩之地，就是有五谷、新酒，和油，并羊羔、牛犊之地。他们的心必像浇灌的园子；他们也不再有一点愁烦。
{Jer 31:13} Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old shall be merry. I will turn their mourning into joy; I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.
{Jer 31:13} 那时，处女必欢乐跳舞；年少的、年老的，也必一同欢乐；因为我要使他们的悲哀变为欢喜，并要安慰他们，使他们的愁烦转为快乐。
{Jer 31:14} I will feast the soul of the priests with abundance, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, declares the LORD."
{Jer 31:14} 我必以肥油使祭司的心满足；我的百姓也要因我的恩惠知足。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 31:15} Thus says the LORD: "A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more."
{Jer 31:15} 耶和华如此说：在拉玛听见号啕痛哭的声音，是拉结哭他儿女，不肯受安慰，因为他们都不在了。
{Jer 31:16} Thus says the LORD: "Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there is a reward for your work, declares the LORD, and they shall come back from the land of the enemy.

{Jer 31:18} I have heard Ephraim grieving, 'You have disciplined me, and I was disciplined, like an untrained calf; bring me back that I may be restored, for you are the LORD my God.
{Jer 31:18} 我听见以法莲为自己悲叹说：你责罚我，我便受责罚，像不惯负轭的牛犊一样。求你使我回转，我便回转，因为你是耶和华我的神。
{Jer 31:19} For after I had turned away, I relented, and after I was instructed, I struck my thigh; I was ashamed, and I was confounded, because I bore the disgrace of my youth.'
{Jer 31:19} 我回转以后就真正懊悔；受教以后就拍腿叹息；我因担当幼年的凌辱就抱愧蒙羞。
{Jer 31:20} Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he my darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I do remember him still. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him, declares the LORD.
{Jer 31:20} 耶和华说：以法莲是我的爱子吗？是可喜悦的孩子吗？我每逢责备他，仍深顾念他；所以我的心肠恋慕他；我必要怜悯他。
{Jer 31:21} "Set up road markers for yourself; make yourself guideposts; consider well the highway, the road by which you went. Return, O virgin Israel, return to these your cities.

{Jer 31:23} Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Once more they shall use these words in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I restore their fortunes: "'The LORD bless you, O habitation of righteousness, O holy hill!'
{Jer 31:23} 万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：“我使被掳之人归回的时候，他们在犹大地和其中的城邑必再这样说：公义的居所啊，圣山哪，愿耶和华赐福给你。
{Jer 31:24} And Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together, and the farmers and those who wander with their flocks.
{Jer 31:24} 犹大和属犹大城邑的人，农夫和放羊的人，要一同住在其中。
{Jer 31:25} For I will satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul I will replenish."
{Jer 31:25} 疲乏的人，我使他饱饫；愁烦的人，我使他知足。”

{Jer 31:26} 先知说：“我醒了，觉着睡得香甜！”
{Jer 31:27} "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast.
{Jer 31:27} 耶和华说：“日子将到，我要把人的种和牲畜的种播种在以色列家和犹大家。
{Jer 31:28} And it shall come to pass that as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring harm, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, declares the LORD.
{Jer 31:28} 我先前怎样留意将他们拔出、拆毁、毁坏、倾覆、苦害，也必照样留意将他们建立、栽植。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 31:29} In those days they shall no longer say: "'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.'
{Jer 31:29} 当那些日子，人不再说：父亲吃了酸葡萄，儿子的牙酸倒了。
{Jer 31:30} But everyone shall die for his own iniquity. Each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
{Jer 31:30} 但各人必因自己的罪死亡；凡吃酸葡萄的，自己的牙必酸倒。”
{Jer 31:31} "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah,
{Jer 31:31} 耶和华说：“日子将到，我要与以色列家和犹大家另立新约，
{Jer 31:32} not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD.
{Jer 31:32} 不像我拉着他们祖宗的手，领他们出埃及地的时候，与他们所立的约。我虽作他们的丈夫，他们却背了我的约。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 31:33} For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
{Jer 31:33} 耶和华说：“那些日子以后，我与以色列家所立的约乃是这样：我要将我的律法放在他们里面，写在他们心上。我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民。
{Jer 31:34} And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
{Jer 31:34} 他们各人不再教导自己的邻舍和自己的弟兄说：‘你该认识耶和华’，因为他们从最小的到至大的都必认识我。我要赦免他们的罪孽，不再记念他们的罪恶。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 31:35} Thus says the LORD, who gives the sun for light by day and the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar-- the LORD of hosts is his name:
{Jer 31:35} 那使太阳白日发光，使星月有定例，黑夜发亮，又搅动大海，使海中波浪砰訇的，万军之耶和华是他的名。他如此说：
{Jer 31:36} "If this fixed order departs from before me, declares the LORD, then shall the offspring of Israel cease from being a nation before me forever."
{Jer 31:36} 这些定例若能在我面前废掉，以色列的后裔也就在我面前断绝，永远不再成国。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 31:37} Thus says the LORD: "If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I will cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done, declares the LORD."
{Jer 31:37} 耶和华如此说：若能量度上天，寻察下地的根基，我就因以色列后裔一切所行的弃绝他们。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 31:38} "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when the city shall be rebuilt for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
{Jer 31:38} 耶和华说：“日子将到，这城必为耶和华建造，从哈楠业楼直到角门。
{Jer 31:39} And the measuring line shall go out farther, straight to the hill Gareb, and shall then turn to Goah.
{Jer 31:39} 准绳要往外量出，直到迦立山，又转到歌亚。
{Jer 31:40} The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be sacred to the LORD. It shall not be plucked up or overthrown anymore forever."
{Jer 31:40} 抛尸的全谷和倒灰之处，并一切田地，直到汲沦溪，又直到东方马门的拐角，都要归耶和华为圣，不再拔出，不再倾覆，直到永远。”
{Jer 32:1}  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
{Jer 32:1}  犹大王西底家第十年，就是尼布甲尼撒十八年，耶和华的话临到耶利米。
{Jer 32:2}  At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah.
{Jer 32:2}  那时巴比伦王的军队围困耶路撒冷，先知耶利米囚在护卫兵的院内，在犹大王的宫中；
{Jer 32:3}  For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, "Why do you prophesy and say, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it;
{Jer 32:3}  因为犹大王西底家已将他囚禁，说：“你为什么预言说，耶和华如此说：‘我必将这城交在巴比伦王的手中，他必攻取这城。
{Jer 32:4}  Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye.
{Jer 32:4}  犹大王西底家必不能逃脱迦勒底人的手，定要交在巴比伦王的手中，要口对口彼此说话，眼对眼彼此相看。
{Jer 32:5}  And he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I visit him, declares the LORD. Though you fight against the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed'?"
{Jer 32:5}  巴比伦王必将西底家带到巴比伦；西底家必住在那里，直到我眷顾他的时候。你们虽与迦勒底人争战，却不顺利。这是耶和华说的。’”
{Jer 32:6}  Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me:
{Jer 32:6}  耶利米说：“耶和华的话临到我说：
{Jer 32:7}  Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say, 'Buy my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.'
{Jer 32:7}  ‘你叔叔沙龙的儿子哈拿篾必来见你，说：我在亚拿突的那块地，求你买来；因你买这地是合乎赎回之理。’”
{Jer 32:8}  Then Hanamel my cousin came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, 'Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
{Jer 32:8}  我叔叔的儿子哈拿篾果然照耶和华的话来到护卫兵的院内，对我说：“我在便雅悯境内、亚拿突的那块地，求你买来；因你买来是合乎承受之理，是你当赎的。你为自己买来吧！”我耶利米就知道这是耶和华的话。
{Jer 32:9}  "And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.
{Jer 32:9}  我便向我叔叔的儿子哈拿篾买了亚拿突的那块地，平了十七舍客勒银子给他。
{Jer 32:10} I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales.
{Jer 32:10} 我在契上画押，将契封缄，又请见证人来，并用天平将银子平给他。
{Jer 32:11} Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions and the open copy.
{Jer 32:11} 我便将照例按规所立的买契，就是封缄的那一张和敞着的那一张，
{Jer 32:12} And I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard.
{Jer 32:12} 当着我叔叔的儿子哈拿篾和画押作见证的人，并坐在护卫兵院内的一切犹大人眼前，交给玛西雅的孙子尼利亚的儿子巴录。
{Jer 32:13} I charged Baruch in their presence, saying,
{Jer 32:13} 当着他们众人眼前，我嘱咐巴录说：
{Jer 32:14} 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time.
{Jer 32:14} “万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：要将这封缄的和敞着的两张契放在瓦器里，可以存留多日。
{Jer 32:15} For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.'
{Jer 32:15} 因为万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：将来在这地必有人再买房屋、田地，和葡萄园。”
{Jer 32:16} "After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying:
{Jer 32:16} 我将买契交给尼利亚的儿子巴录以后，便祷告耶和华说：
{Jer 32:17} 'Ah, Lord GOD! It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you.
{Jer 32:17} “主耶和华啊，你曾用大能和伸出来的膀臂创造天地，在你没有难成的事。
{Jer 32:18} You show steadfast love to thousands, but you repay the guilt of fathers to their children after them, O great and mighty God, whose name is the LORD of hosts,
{Jer 32:18} 你施慈爱与千万人，又将父亲的罪孽报应在他后世子孙的怀中，是至大全能的神，万军之耶和华是你的名。
{Jer 32:19} great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of man, rewarding each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds.
{Jer 32:19} 谋事有大略，行事有大能，注目观看世人一切的举动，为要照各人所行的和他做事的结果报应他。
{Jer 32:20} You have shown signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all mankind, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day.
{Jer 32:20} 在埃及地显神迹奇事，直到今日在以色列和别人中间也是如此，使自己得了名声，正如今日一样。
{Jer 32:21} You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror.
{Jer 32:21} 用神迹奇事和大能的手，并伸出来的膀臂与大可畏的事，领你的百姓以色列出了埃及。
{Jer 32:22} And you gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
{Jer 32:22} 将这地赐给他们，就是你向他们列祖起誓应许赐给他们流奶与蜜之地。
{Jer 32:23} And they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your voice or walk in your law. They did nothing of all you commanded them to do. Therefore you have made all this disaster come upon them.
{Jer 32:23} 他们进入这地得了为业，却不听从你的话，也不遵行你的律法；你一切所吩咐他们行的，他们一无所行，因此你使这一切的灾祸临到他们。
{Jer 32:24} Behold, the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and because of sword and famine and pestilence the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you spoke has come to pass, and behold, you see it.
{Jer 32:24} 看哪，敌人已经来到，筑垒要攻取这城；城也因刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫交在攻城的迦勒底人手中。你所说的话都成就了，你也看见了。
{Jer 32:25} Yet you, O Lord GOD, have said to me, "Buy the field for money and get witnesses"--though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.'"
{Jer 32:25} 主耶和华啊，你对我说：要用银子为自己买那块地，又请见证人。其实这城已交在迦勒底人的手中了。”
{Jer 32:26} The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
{Jer 32:26} 耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 32:27} "Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is anything too hard for me?
{Jer 32:27} “我是耶和华，是凡有血气者的神，岂有我难成的事吗？
{Jer 32:28} Therefore, thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall capture it.
{Jer 32:28} 耶和华如此说：我必将这城交付迦勒底人的手和巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒的手，他必攻取这城。
{Jer 32:29} The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs offerings have been made to Baal and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
{Jer 32:29} 攻城的迦勒底人必来放火焚烧这城和其中的房屋。在这房屋上，人曾向巴力烧香，向别神浇奠，惹我发怒。
{Jer 32:30} For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth. The children of Israel have done nothing but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, declares the LORD.
{Jer 32:30} 以色列人和犹大人自从幼年以来，专行我眼中看为恶的事；以色列人尽以手所做的惹我发怒。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 32:31} This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, so that I will remove it from my sight
{Jer 32:31} 这城自从建造的那日直到今日，常惹我的怒气和忿怒，使我将这城从我面前除掉；
{Jer 32:32} because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger--their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{Jer 32:32} 是因以色列人和犹大人一切的邪恶，就是他们和他们的君王、首领、祭司、先知，并犹大的众人，以及耶路撒冷的居民所行的，惹我发怒。
{Jer 32:33} They have turned to me their back and not their face. And though I have taught them persistently, they have not listened to receive instruction.
{Jer 32:33} 他们以背向我，不以面向我；我虽从早起来教训他们，他们却不听从，不受教训，
{Jer 32:34} They set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.
{Jer 32:34} 竟把可憎之物设立在称为我名下的殿中，污秽了这殿。
{Jer 32:35} They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
{Jer 32:35} 他们在欣嫩子谷建筑巴力的邱坛，好使自己的儿女经火归摩洛；他们行这可憎的事，使犹大陷在罪里，这并不是我所吩咐的，也不是我心所起的意。”
{Jer 32:36} "Now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, 'It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence':
{Jer 32:36} 现在论到这城，就是你们所说、已经因刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫交在巴比伦王手中的，耶和华以色列的神如此说：
{Jer 32:37} Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation. I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them dwell in safety.
{Jer 32:37} “我在怒气、忿怒，和大恼恨中，将以色列人赶到各国。日后我必从那里将他们招聚出来，领他们回到此地，使他们安然居住。
{Jer 32:38} And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
{Jer 32:38} 他们要作我的子民，我要作他们的神。
{Jer 32:39} I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their own good and the good of their children after them.
{Jer 32:39} 我要使他们彼此同心同道，好叫他们永远敬畏我，使他们和他们后世的子孙得福乐，
{Jer 32:40} I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them. And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me.
{Jer 32:40} 又要与他们立永远的约，必随着他们施恩，并不离开他们，且使他们有敬畏我的心，不离开我。
{Jer 32:41} I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul.
{Jer 32:41} 我必欢喜施恩与他们，要尽心尽意、诚诚实实将他们栽于此地。
{Jer 32:42} "For thus says the LORD: Just as I have brought all this great disaster upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise them.
{Jer 32:42} “因为耶和华如此说：我怎样使这一切大祸临到这百姓，我也要照样使我所应许他们的一切福乐都临到他们。
{Jer 32:43} Fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, 'It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.'
{Jer 32:43} 你们说，这地是荒凉、无人民、无牲畜，是交付迦勒底人手之地。日后在这境内，必有人置买田地。
{Jer 32:44} Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be signed and sealed and witnessed, in the land of Benjamin, in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for I will restore their fortunes, declares the LORD."
{Jer 32:44} 在便雅悯地、耶路撒冷四围的各处、犹大的城邑、山地的城邑、高原的城邑，并南地的城邑，人必用银子买田地，在契上画押，将契封缄，请出见证人，因为我必使被掳的人归回。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 33:1}  The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard:
{Jer 33:1}  耶利米还囚在护卫兵的院内，耶和华的话第二次临到他说：
{Jer 33:2}  "Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed it to establish it--the LORD is his name:
{Jer 33:2}  “成就的是耶和华，造作、为要建立的也是耶和华；耶和华是他的名。他如此说：
{Jer 33:3}  Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known.
{Jer 33:3}  你求告我，我就应允你，并将你所不知道、又大又难的事指示你。
{Jer 33:4}  For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to make a defense against the siege mounds and against the sword:
{Jer 33:4}  论到这城中的房屋和犹大王的宫室，就是拆毁为挡敌人高垒和刀剑的，耶和华以色列的神如此说：
{Jer 33:5}  They are coming in to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom I shall strike down in my anger and my wrath, for I have hidden my face from this city because of all their evil.
{Jer 33:5}  人要与迦勒底人争战，正是拿死尸充满这房屋，就是我在怒气和忿怒中所杀的人，因他们的一切恶，我就掩面不顾这城。
{Jer 33:6}  Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security.
{Jer 33:6}  看哪，我要使这城得以痊愈安舒，使城中的人得医治，又将丰盛的平安和诚实显明与他们。
{Jer 33:7}  I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and rebuild them as they were at first.
{Jer 33:7}  我也要使犹大被掳的和以色列被掳的归回，并建立他们和起初一样。
{Jer 33:8}  I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me.
{Jer 33:8}  我要除净他们的一切罪，就是向我所犯的罪；又要赦免他们的一切罪，就是干犯我、违背我的罪。
{Jer 33:9}  And this city shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for them. They shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.
{Jer 33:9}  这城要在地上万国人面前使我得颂赞，得荣耀，名为可喜可乐之城。万国人因听见我向这城所赐的福乐、所施的恩惠平安，就惧怕战兢。”
{Jer 33:10} "Thus says the LORD: In this place of which you say, 'It is a waste without man or beast,' in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man or inhabitant or beast, there shall be heard again
{Jer 33:10} 耶和华如此说：“你们论这地方，说是荒废无人民无牲畜之地，但在这荒凉无人民无牲畜的犹大城邑和耶路撒冷的街上，
{Jer 33:11} the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing, as they bring thank offerings to the house of the LORD: "'Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, for the LORD is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!' For I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the LORD.
{Jer 33:11} 必再听见有欢喜和快乐的声音、新郎和新妇的声音，并听见有人说：要称谢万军之耶和华，因耶和华本为善；他的慈爱永远长存！又有奉感谢祭到耶和华殿中之人的声音；因为我必使这地被掳的人归回，和起初一样。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 33:12} "Thus says the LORD of hosts: In this place that is waste, without man or beast, and in all of its cities, there shall again be habitations of shepherds resting their flocks.
{Jer 33:12} 万军之耶和华如此说：“在这荒废无人民无牲畜之地，并其中所有的城邑，必再有牧人的住处；他们要使羊群躺卧在那里。
{Jer 33:13} In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin, the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of the one who counts them, says the LORD.
{Jer 33:13} 在山地的城邑、高原的城邑、南地的城邑、便雅悯地、耶路撒冷四围的各处，和犹大的城邑必再有羊群从数点的人手下经过。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 33:14} "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
{Jer 33:14} 耶和华说：“日子将到，我应许以色列家和犹大家的恩言必然成就。
{Jer 33:15} In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
{Jer 33:15} 当那日子，那时候，我必使大卫公义的苗裔长起来；他必在地上施行公平和公义。
{Jer 33:16} In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which it will be called: 'The LORD is our righteousness.'
{Jer 33:16} 在那日子犹大必得救，耶路撒冷必安然居住，他的名必称为‘耶和华我们的义’。
{Jer 33:17} "For thus says the LORD: David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,
{Jer 33:17} “因为耶和华如此说：大卫必永不断人坐在以色列家的宝座上；
{Jer 33:18} and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to make sacrifices forever."
{Jer 33:18} 祭司、利未人在我面前也不断人献燔祭、烧素祭，时常办理献祭的事。”
{Jer 33:19} The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
{Jer 33:19} 耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 33:20} "Thus says the LORD: If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night will not come at their appointed time,
{Jer 33:20} “耶和华如此说：你们若能废弃我所立白日黑夜的约，使白日黑夜不按时轮转，
{Jer 33:21} then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests my ministers.
{Jer 33:21} 就能废弃我与我仆人大卫所立的约，使他没有儿子在他的宝座上为王，并能废弃我与事奉我的祭司、利未人所立的约。
{Jer 33:22} As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant, and the Levitical priests who minister to me."
{Jer 33:22} 天上的万象不能数算，海边的尘沙也不能斗量；我必照样使我仆人大卫的后裔和事奉我的利未人多起来。”
{Jer 33:23} The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
{Jer 33:23} 耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 33:24} "Have you not observed that these people are saying, 'The LORD has rejected the two clans that he chose'? Thus they have despised my people so that they are no longer a nation in their sight.
{Jer 33:24} “你没有揣摩这百姓的话吗？他们说：‘耶和华所拣选的二族，他已经弃绝了。’他们这样藐视我的百姓，以为不再成国。
{Jer 33:25} Thus says the LORD: If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the fixed order of heaven and earth,
{Jer 33:25} 耶和华如此说：若是我立白日黑夜的约不能存住，若是我未曾安排天地的定例，
{Jer 33:26} then I will reject the offspring of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his offspring to rule over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them."
{Jer 33:26} 我就弃绝雅各的后裔和我仆人大卫的后裔，不使大卫的后裔治理亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的后裔；因为我必使他们被掳的人归回，也必怜悯他们。”
{Jer 34:1}  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities:
{Jer 34:1}  巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒率领他的全军和地上属他的各国各邦，攻打耶路撒冷和属耶路撒冷所有的城邑。那时，耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 34:2}  "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
{Jer 34:2}  “耶和华以色列的神说，你去告诉犹大王西底家，耶和华如此说：我要将这城交付巴比伦王的手，他必用火焚烧。
{Jer 34:3}  You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face. And you shall go to Babylon.'
{Jer 34:3}  你必不能逃脱他的手，定被拿住，交在他的手中。你的眼要见巴比伦王的眼，他要口对口和你说话，你也必到巴比伦去。
{Jer 34:4}  Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you: 'You shall not die by the sword.
{Jer 34:4}  犹大王西底家啊，你还要听耶和华的话。耶和华论到你如此说：你必不被刀剑杀死，
{Jer 34:5}  You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so people shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, "Alas, lord!"' For I have spoken the word, declares the LORD."
{Jer 34:5}  你必平安而死，人必为你焚烧物件，好像为你列祖，就是在你以前的先王焚烧一般。人必为你举哀说：‘哀哉！我主啊。’耶和华说：这话是我说的。”
{Jer 34:6}  Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
{Jer 34:6}  于是，先知耶利米在耶路撒冷将这一切话告诉犹大王西底家。
{Jer 34:7}  when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah, for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained.
{Jer 34:7}  那时，巴比伦王的军队正攻打耶路撒冷，又攻打犹大所剩下的城邑，就是拉吉和亚西加。原来犹大的坚固城只剩下这两座。
{Jer 34:8}  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them,
{Jer 34:8}  西底家王与耶路撒冷的众民立约，要向他们宣告自由，叫各人任他希伯来的仆人和婢女自由出去，谁也不可使他的一个犹大弟兄作奴仆。（此后，有耶和华的话临到耶利米。）
{Jer 34:9}  that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother.
{Jer 34:9}  (SEE 34:8)
{Jer 34:10} And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant that everyone would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again. They obeyed and set them free.
{Jer 34:10} 所有立约的首领和众民就任他的仆人婢女自由出去，谁也不再叫他们作奴仆。大家都顺从，将他们释放了；
{Jer 34:11} But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves.
{Jer 34:11} 后来却又反悔，叫所任去自由的仆人婢女回来，勉强他们仍为仆婢。
{Jer 34:12} The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
{Jer 34:12} 因此耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 34:13} "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying,
{Jer 34:13} “耶和华以色列的神如此说：我将你们的列祖从埃及地为奴之家领出来的时候，与他们立约说：
{Jer 34:14} 'At the end of seven years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must set him free from your service.' But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me.
{Jer 34:14} ‘你的一个希伯来弟兄若卖给你，服事你六年，到第七年你们各人就要任他自由出去。’只是你们列祖不听从我，也不侧耳而听。
{Jer 34:15} You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name,
{Jer 34:15} 如今你们回转，行我眼中看为正的事，各人向邻舍宣告自由，并且在称为我名下的殿中、在我面前立约。
{Jer 34:16} but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.
{Jer 34:16} 你们却又反悔，亵渎我的名，各人叫所任去随意自由的仆人婢女回来，勉强他们仍为仆婢。
{Jer 34:17} "Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, declares the LORD. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
{Jer 34:17} 所以耶和华如此说：你们没有听从我，各人向弟兄邻舍宣告自由。看哪！我向你们宣告一样自由，就是使你们自由于刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫之下，并且使你们在天下万国中抛来抛去。这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 34:18} And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant that they made before me, I will make them like the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts--
{Jer 34:18} 犹大的首领、耶路撒冷的首领、太监、祭司，和国中的众民曾将牛犊劈开，分成两半，从其中经过，在我面前立约。后来又违背我的约，不遵行这约上的话。
{Jer 34:19} the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf.
{Jer 34:19} (SEE 34:18)
{Jer 34:20} And I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
{Jer 34:20} 我必将他们交在仇敌和寻索其命的人手中；他们的尸首必给空中的飞鸟和地上的野兽作食物。
{Jer 34:21} And Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you.
{Jer 34:21} 并且我必将犹大王西底家和他的首领交在他们仇敌和寻索其命的人，与那暂离你们而去巴比伦王军队的手中。
{Jer 34:22} Behold, I will command, declares the LORD, and will bring them back to this city. And they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant."
{Jer 34:22} 耶和华说：我必吩咐他们回到这城，攻打这城，将城攻取，用火焚烧。我也要使犹大的城邑变为荒场，无人居住。”
{Jer 35:1}  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
{Jer 35:1}  当犹大王约西亚之子约雅敬的时候，耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 35:2}  "Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak with them and bring them to the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink."
{Jer 35:2}  “你去见利甲族的人，和他们说话，领他们进入耶和华殿的一间屋子，给他们酒喝。”
{Jer 35:3}  So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites.
{Jer 35:3}  我就将哈巴洗尼雅的孙子雅利米雅的儿子雅撒尼亚和他弟兄，并他众子，以及利甲全族的人，
{Jer 35:4}  I brought them to the house of the LORD into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.
{Jer 35:4}  领到耶和华的殿，进入神人伊基大利的儿子哈难众子的屋子。那屋子在首领的屋子旁边，在沙龙之子把门的玛西雅屋子以上。
{Jer 35:5}  Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, "Drink wine."
{Jer 35:5}  于是我在利甲族人面前设摆盛满酒的碗和杯，对他们说：“请你们喝酒。”
{Jer 35:6}  But they answered, "We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, 'You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons forever.
{Jer 35:6}  他们却说：“我们不喝酒；因为我们先祖利甲的儿子约拿达曾吩咐我们说：‘你们与你们的子孙永不可喝酒，
{Jer 35:7}  You shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not plant or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.'
{Jer 35:7}  也不可盖房、撒种、栽种葡萄园，但一生的年日要住帐棚，使你们的日子在寄居之地得以延长。’
{Jer 35:8}  We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,
{Jer 35:8}  凡我们先祖利甲的儿子约拿达所吩咐我们的话，我们都听从了。我们和我们的妻子儿女一生的年日都不喝酒，
{Jer 35:9}  and not to build houses to dwell in. We have no vineyard or field or seed,
{Jer 35:9}  也不盖房居住，也没有葡萄园、田地，和种子，
{Jer 35:10} but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
{Jer 35:10} 但住帐棚，听从我们先祖约拿达的话，照他所吩咐我们的去行。
{Jer 35:11} But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, 'Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians.' So we are living in Jerusalem."
{Jer 35:11} 巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒上此地来，我们因怕迦勒底的军队和亚兰的军队，就说：‘来吧，我们到耶路撒冷去。’这样，我们才住在耶路撒冷。”
{Jer 35:12} Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
{Jer 35:12} 耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 35:13} "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? declares the LORD.
{Jer 35:13} “万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：你去对犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民说，耶和华说：你们不受教训，不听从我的话吗？
{Jer 35:14} The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept, and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened to me.
{Jer 35:14} 利甲的儿子约拿达所吩咐他子孙不可喝酒的话，他们已经遵守，直到今日也不喝酒，因为他们听从先祖的吩咐。我从早起来警戒你们，你们却不听从我。
{Jer 35:15} I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, 'Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to you and your fathers.' But you did not incline your ear or listen to me.
{Jer 35:15} 我从早起来，差遣我的仆人众先知去，说：‘你们各人当回头，离开恶道，改正行为，不随从事奉别神，就必住在我所赐给你们和你们列祖的地上。’只是你们没有听从我，也没有侧耳而听。
{Jer 35:16} The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me.
{Jer 35:16} 利甲的儿子约拿达的子孙能遵守先人所吩咐他们的命，这百姓却没有听从我！
{Jer 35:17} Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered."
{Jer 35:17} 因此，耶和华万军之神、以色列的神如此说：我要使我所说的一切灾祸临到犹大人和耶路撒冷的一切居民。因为我对他们说话，他们没有听从；我呼唤他们，他们没有答应。”
{Jer 35:18} But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you,
{Jer 35:18} 耶利米对利甲族的人说：“万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：因你们听从你们先祖约拿达的吩咐，谨守他的一切诫命，照他所吩咐你们的去行，
{Jer 35:19} therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me."
{Jer 35:19} 所以万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：利甲的儿子约拿达必永不缺人侍立在我面前。”
{Jer 36:1}  In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
{Jer 36:1}  犹大王约西亚的儿子约雅敬第四年，耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 36:2}  "Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today.
{Jer 36:2}  “你取一书卷，将我对你说攻击以色列和犹大，并各国的一切话，从我对你说话的那日，就是从约西亚的日子起直到今日，都写在其上。
{Jer 36:3}  It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend to do to them, so that every one may turn from his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."
{Jer 36:3}  或者犹大家听见我想要降与他们的一切灾祸，各人就回头，离开恶道，我好赦免他们的罪孽和罪恶。”
{Jer 36:4}  Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD that he had spoken to him.
{Jer 36:4}  所以，耶利米召了尼利亚的儿子巴录来；巴录就从耶利米口中，将耶和华对耶利米所说的一切话写在书卷上。
{Jer 36:5}  And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, "I am banned from going to the house of the LORD,
{Jer 36:5}  耶利米吩咐巴录说：“我被拘管，不能进耶和华的殿。
{Jer 36:6}  so you are to go, and on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people in the LORD's house you shall read the words of the LORD from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities.
{Jer 36:6}  所以你要去趁禁食的日子，在耶和华殿中将耶和华的话，就是你从我口中所写在书卷上的话，念给百姓和一切从犹大城邑出来的人听。
{Jer 36:7}  It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the LORD, and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people."
{Jer 36:7}  或者他们在耶和华面前恳求各人回头，离开恶道，因为耶和华向这百姓所说要发的怒气和忿怒是大的。”
{Jer 36:8}  And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.
{Jer 36:8}  尼利亚的儿子巴录就照先知耶利米一切所吩咐的去行，在耶和华的殿中从书上念耶和华的话。
{Jer 36:9}  In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD.
{Jer 36:9}  犹大王约西亚的儿子约雅敬第五年九月，耶路撒冷的众民和那从犹大城邑来到耶路撒冷的众民，在耶和华面前宣告禁食的日子，
{Jer 36:10} Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD's house.
{Jer 36:10} 巴录就在耶和华殿的上院，耶和华殿的新门口，沙番的儿子文士基玛利雅的屋内，念书上耶利米的话给众民听。
{Jer 36:11} When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
{Jer 36:11} 沙番的孙子、基玛利雅的儿子米该亚听见书上耶和华的一切话，
{Jer 36:12} he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber, and all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the officials.
{Jer 36:12} 他就下到王宫，进入文士的屋子。众首领，就是文士以利沙玛、示玛雅的儿子第莱雅、亚革波的儿子以利拿单、沙番的儿子基玛利雅、哈拿尼雅的儿子西底家，和其余的首领都坐在那里。
{Jer 36:13} And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people.
{Jer 36:13} 于是米该亚对他们述说他所听见的一切话，就是巴录向百姓念那书的时候所听见的。
{Jer 36:14} Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come." So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.
{Jer 36:14} 众首领就打发古示的曾孙、示利米雅的孙子、尼探雅的儿子犹底到巴录那里，对他说：“你将所念给百姓听的书卷拿在手中到我们这里来。”尼利亚的儿子巴录就手拿书卷来到他们那里。
{Jer 36:15} And they said to him, "Sit down and read it." So Baruch read it to them.
{Jer 36:15} 他们对他说：“请你坐下，念给我们听。”巴录就念给他们听。
{Jer 36:16} When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And they said to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king."
{Jer 36:16} 他们听见这一切话就害怕，面面相观，对巴录说：“我们必须将这一切话告诉王。”
{Jer 36:17} Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?"
{Jer 36:17} 他们问巴录说：“请你告诉我们，你怎样从他口中写这一切话呢？”
{Jer 36:18} Baruch answered them, "He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote them with ink on the scroll."
{Jer 36:18} 巴录回答说：“他用口向我说这一切话，我就用笔墨写在书上。”
{Jer 36:19} Then the officials said to Baruch, "Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are."
{Jer 36:19} 众首领对巴录说：“你和耶利米要去藏起来，不可叫人知道你们在那里。”
{Jer 36:20} So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words to the king.
{Jer 36:20} 众首领进院见王，却先把书卷存在文士以利沙玛的屋内，以后将这一切话说给王听。
{Jer 36:21} Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king.
{Jer 36:21} 王就打发犹底去拿这书卷来，他便从文士以利沙玛的屋内取来，念给王和王左右侍立的众首领听。
{Jer 36:22} It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him.
{Jer 36:22} 那时正是九月，王坐在过冬的房屋里，王的前面火盆中有烧着的火。
{Jer 36:23} As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot.
{Jer 36:23} 犹底念了三四篇（或作：行），王就用文士的刀将书卷割破，扔在火盆中，直到全卷在火中烧尽了。
{Jer 36:24} Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, nor did they tear their garments.
{Jer 36:24} 王和听见这一切话的臣仆都不惧怕，也不撕裂衣服。
{Jer 36:25} Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
{Jer 36:25} 以利拿单和第莱雅，并基玛利雅恳求王不要烧这书卷，他却不听。
{Jer 36:26} And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.
{Jer 36:26} 王就吩咐哈米勒的儿子（或作：王的儿子）耶拉篾和亚斯列的儿子西莱雅，并亚伯叠的儿子示利米雅，去捉拿文士巴录和先知耶利米。耶和华却将他们隐藏。
{Jer 36:27} Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
{Jer 36:27} 王烧了书卷（其上有巴录从耶利米口中所写的话）以后，耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 36:28} "Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
{Jer 36:28} “你再取一卷，将犹大王约雅敬所烧第一卷上的一切话写在其上。
{Jer 36:29} And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, 'Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, "Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?"
{Jer 36:29} 论到犹大王约雅敬你要说，耶和华如此说：你烧了书卷，说：‘你为什么在其上写着，说巴比伦王必要来毁灭这地，使这地上绝了人民牲畜呢？’
{Jer 36:30} Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night.
{Jer 36:30} 所以耶和华论到犹大王约雅敬说：他后裔中必没有人坐在大卫的宝座上；他的尸首必被抛弃，白日受炎热，黑夜受寒霜。
{Jer 36:31} And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.'"
{Jer 36:31} 我必因他和他后裔，并他臣仆的罪孽刑罚他们。我要使我所说的一切灾祸临到他们和耶路撒冷的居民，并犹大人；只是他们不听。”
{Jer 36:32} Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
{Jer 36:32} 于是，耶利米又取一书卷交给尼利亚的儿子文士巴录，他就从耶利米的口中写了犹大王约雅敬所烧前卷上的一切话，另外又添了许多相彷的话。
{Jer 37:1}  Zedekiah the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim.
{Jer 37:1}  约西亚的儿子西底家代替约雅敬的儿子哥尼雅为王，是巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒立在犹大地作王的。
{Jer 37:2}  But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD that he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
{Jer 37:2}  但西底家和他的臣仆，并国中的百姓，都不听从耶和华藉先知耶利米所说的话。
{Jer 37:3}  King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "Please pray for us to the LORD our God."
{Jer 37:3}  西底家王打发示利米雅的儿子犹甲和祭司玛西雅的儿子西番雅去见先知耶利米，说：“求你为我们祷告耶和华我们的神。”
{Jer 37:4}  Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.
{Jer 37:4}  那时耶利米在民中出入，因为他们还没有把他囚在监里。
{Jer 37:5}  The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt. And when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
{Jer 37:5}  法老的军队已经从埃及出来，那围困耶路撒冷的迦勒底人听见他们的风声，就拔营离开耶路撒冷去了。
{Jer 37:6}  Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:
{Jer 37:6}  耶和华的话临到先知耶利米说：
{Jer 37:7}  "Thus says the LORD, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me, 'Behold, Pharaoh's army that came to help you is about to return to Egypt, to its own land.
{Jer 37:7}  “耶和华以色列的神如此说：犹大王打发你们来求问我，你们要如此对他说：‘那出来帮助你们法老的军队必回埃及本国去。
{Jer 37:8}  And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city. They shall capture it and burn it with fire.
{Jer 37:8}  迦勒底人必再来攻打这城，并要攻取，用火焚烧。
{Jer 37:9}  Thus says the LORD, Do not deceive yourselves, saying, "The Chaldeans will surely go away from us," for they will not go away.
{Jer 37:9}  耶和华如此说：你们不要自欺说“迦勒底人必定离开我们”，因为他们必不离开。
{Jer 37:10} For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.'"
{Jer 37:10} 你们即便杀败了与你们争战的迦勒底全军，但剩下受伤的人也必各人从帐棚里起来，用火焚烧这城。’”
{Jer 37:11} Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army,
{Jer 37:11} 迦勒底的军队因怕法老的军队，拔营离开耶路撒冷的时候，
{Jer 37:12} Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people.
{Jer 37:12} 耶利米就杂在民中出离耶路撒冷，要往便雅悯地去，在那里得自己的地业。
{Jer 37:13} When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You are deserting to the Chaldeans."
{Jer 37:13} 他到了便雅悯门那里，有守门官名叫伊利雅，是哈拿尼亚的孙子、示利米雅的儿子，他就拿住先知耶利米，说：“你是投降迦勒底人哪！”
{Jer 37:14} And Jeremiah said, "It is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans." But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
{Jer 37:14} 耶利米说：“你这是谎话，我并不是投降迦勒底人。”伊利雅不听他的话，就拿住他，解到首领那里。
{Jer 37:15} And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.
{Jer 37:15} 首领恼怒耶利米，就打了他，将他囚在文士约拿单的房屋中，因为他们以这房屋当作监牢。
{Jer 37:16} When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days,
{Jer 37:16} 耶利米来到狱中，进入牢房，在那里囚了多日。
{Jer 37:17} King Zedekiah sent for him and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house and said, "Is there any word from the LORD?" Jeremiah said, "There is." Then he said, "You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon."
{Jer 37:17} 西底家王打发人提出他来，在自己的宫内私下问他说：“从耶和华有什么话临到没有？”耶利米说：“有！”又说：“你必交在巴比伦王手中。”
{Jer 37:18} Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, "What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?
{Jer 37:18} 耶利米又对西底家王说：“我在什么事上得罪你，或你的臣仆，或这百姓，你竟将我囚在监里呢？
{Jer 37:19} Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land'?
{Jer 37:19} 对你们预言巴比伦王必不来攻击你们和这地的先知，现今在那里呢？
{Jer 37:20} Now hear, please, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there."
{Jer 37:20} 主我的王啊，求你现在垂听，准我在你面前的恳求：不要使我回到文士约拿单的房屋中，免得我死在那里。”
{Jer 37:21} So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard. And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
{Jer 37:21} 于是，西底家王下令，他们就把耶利米交在护卫兵的院中，每天从饼铺街取一个饼给他，直到城中的饼用尽了。这样，耶利米仍在护卫兵的院中。
{Jer 38:1}  Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people,
{Jer 38:1}  玛坦的儿子示法提雅、巴施户珥的儿子基大利、示利米雅的儿子犹甲、玛基雅的儿子巴示户珥听见耶利米对众人所说的话，说：
{Jer 38:2}  "Thus says the LORD: He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live. He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live.
{Jer 38:2}  “耶和华如此说：住在这城里的必遭刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫而死；但出去归降迦勒底人的必得存活，就是以自己命为掠物的，必得存活。
{Jer 38:3}  Thus says the LORD: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken."
{Jer 38:3}  耶和华如此说：这城必要交在巴比伦王军队的手中，他必攻取这城。”
{Jer 38:4}  Then the officials said to the king, "Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm."
{Jer 38:4}  于是首领对王说：“求你将这人治死；因他向城里剩下的兵丁和众民说这样的话，使他们的手发软。这人不是求这百姓得平安，乃是叫他们受灾祸。”
{Jer 38:5}  King Zedekiah said, "Behold, he is in your hands, for the king can do nothing against you."
{Jer 38:5}  西底家王说：“他在你们手中，无论何事，王也不能与你们反对。”
{Jer 38:6}  So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
{Jer 38:6}  他们就拿住耶利米，下在哈米勒的儿子（或作：王的儿子）玛基雅的牢狱里；那牢狱在护卫兵的院中。他们用绳子将耶利米系下去。牢狱里没有水，只有淤泥，耶利米就陷在淤泥中。
{Jer 38:7}  When Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern--the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate--
{Jer 38:7}  在王宫的太监古实人以伯米勒，听见他们将耶利米下了牢狱（那时王坐在便雅悯门口），
{Jer 38:8}  Ebed-melech went from the king's house and said to the king,
{Jer 38:8}  以伯米勒就从王宫里出来，对王说：
{Jer 38:9}  "My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city."
{Jer 38:9}  “主我的王啊，这些人向先知耶利米一味地行恶，将他下在牢狱中；他在那里必因饥饿而死，因为城中再没有粮食。”
{Jer 38:10} Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, "Take thirty men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."
{Jer 38:10} 王就吩咐古实人以伯米勒说：“你从这里带领三十人，趁着先知耶利米未死以前，将他从牢狱中提上来。”
{Jer 38:11} So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes.
{Jer 38:11} 于是以伯米勒带领这些人同去，进入王宫，到库房以下，从那里取了些碎布和破烂的衣服，用绳子缒下牢狱去到耶利米那里。
{Jer 38:12} Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes." Jeremiah did so.
{Jer 38:12} 古实人以伯米勒对耶利米说：“你用这些碎布和破烂的衣服放在绳子上，垫你的胳肢窝。”耶利米就照样行了。
{Jer 38:13} Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
{Jer 38:13} 这样，他们用绳子将耶利米从牢狱里拉上来。耶利米仍在护卫兵的院中。
{Jer 38:14} King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, "I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me."
{Jer 38:14} 西底家王打发人带领先知耶利米，进耶和华殿中第三门里见王。王就对耶利米说：“我要问你一件事，你丝毫不可向我隐瞒。”
{Jer 38:15} Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me."
{Jer 38:15} 耶利米对西底家说：“我若告诉你，你岂不定要杀我吗？我若劝戒你，你必不听从我。”
{Jer 38:16} Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, "As the LORD lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life."
{Jer 38:16} 西底家王就私下向耶利米说：“我指着那造我们生命之永生的耶和华起誓：我必不杀你，也不将你交在寻索你命的人手中。”
{Jer 38:17} Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live.
{Jer 38:17} 耶利米对西底家说：“耶和华万军之神、以色列的神如此说：你若出去归降巴比伦王的首领，你的命就必存活，这城也不至被火焚烧，你和你的全家都必存活。
{Jer 38:18} But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand."
{Jer 38:18} 你若不出去归降巴比伦王的首领，这城必交在迦勒底人手中。他们必用火焚烧，你也不得脱离他们的手。”
{Jer 38:19} King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me."
{Jer 38:19} 西底家王对耶利米说：“我怕那些投降迦勒底人的犹大人，恐怕迦勒底人将我交在他们手中，他们戏弄我。”
{Jer 38:20} Jeremiah said, "You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the LORD in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared.
{Jer 38:20} 耶利米说：“迦勒底人必不将你交出。求你听从我对你所说耶和华的话，这样你必得好处，你的命也必存活。
{Jer 38:21} But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the LORD has shown to me:
{Jer 38:21} 你若不肯出去，耶和华指示我的话乃是这样：
{Jer 38:22} Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying, "'Your trusted friends have deceived you and prevailed against you; now that your feet are sunk in the mud, they turn away from you.'
{Jer 38:22} 犹大王宫里所剩的妇女必都带到巴比伦王的首领那里。这些妇女必说：你知己的朋友催逼你，胜过你；见你的脚陷入淤泥中，就转身退后了。
{Jer 38:23} All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire."
{Jer 38:23} “人必将你的后妃和你的儿女带到迦勒底人那里；你也不得脱离他们的手，必被巴比伦王的手捉住；你也必使这城被火焚烧。”
{Jer 38:24} Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die.
{Jer 38:24} 西底家对耶利米说：“不要使人知道这些话，你就不至于死。
{Jer 38:25} If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,'
{Jer 38:25} 首领若听见了我与你说话，就来见你，问你说：‘你对王说什么话不要向我们隐瞒，我们就不杀你。王向你说什么话也要告诉我们。’你就对他们说：‘我在王面前恳求不要叫我回到约拿单的房屋死在那里。’”
{Jer 38:26} then you shall say to them, 'I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.'"
{Jer 38:26} 你就对他们说：‘我在王面前恳求不要叫我回到约拿单的房屋死在那里。’”
{Jer 38:27} Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard.
{Jer 38:27} 随后众首领来见耶利米，问他，他就照王所吩咐的一切话回答他们。他们不再与他说话，因为事情没有泄漏。
{Jer 38:28} And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
{Jer 38:28} 于是耶利米仍在护卫兵的院中，直到耶路撒冷被攻取的日子。
{Jer 39:1}  In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it.
{Jer 39:1}  犹大王西底家第九年十月，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒率领全军来围困耶路撒冷。
{Jer 39:2}  In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city.
{Jer 39:2}  西底家十一年四月初九日，城被攻破。
{Jer 39:3}  Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sar-ezer of Samgar, Nebu-sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon.
{Jer 39:3}  耶路撒冷被攻取的时候，巴比伦王的首领尼甲沙利薛、三甲尼波、撒西金、拉撒力、尼甲沙利薛拉墨，并巴比伦王其余的一切首领都来坐在中门。
{Jer 39:4}  When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah.
{Jer 39:4}  犹大王西底家和一切兵丁看见他们，就在夜间从靠近王园两城中间的门出城逃跑，往亚拉巴逃去。
{Jer 39:5}  But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence on him.
{Jer 39:5}  迦勒底的军队追赶他们，在耶利哥的平原追上西底家，将他拿住，带到哈马地的利比拉、巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒那里；尼布甲尼撒就审判他。
{Jer 39:6}  The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes, and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah.
{Jer 39:6}  巴比伦王在利比拉、西底家眼前杀了他的众子，又杀了犹大的一切贵胄，
{Jer 39:7}  He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon.
{Jer 39:7}  并且剜西底家的眼睛，用铜链锁着他，要带到巴比伦去。
{Jer 39:8}  The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
{Jer 39:8}  迦勒底人用火焚烧王宫和百姓的房屋，又拆毁耶路撒冷的城墙。
{Jer 39:9}  Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained.
{Jer 39:9}  那时，护卫长尼布撒拉旦将城里所剩下的百姓和投降他的逃民，以及其余的民都掳到巴比伦去了。
{Jer 39:10} Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
{Jer 39:10} 护卫长尼布撒拉旦却将民中毫无所有的穷人留在犹大地，当时给他们葡萄园和田地。
{Jer 39:11} Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying,
{Jer 39:11} 巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒提到耶利米，嘱咐护卫长尼布撒拉旦说：
{Jer 39:12} "Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you."
{Jer 39:12} “你领他去，好好地看待他，切不可害他；他对你怎么说，你就向他怎么行。”
{Jer 39:13} So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon
{Jer 39:13} 护卫长尼布撒拉旦和尼布沙斯班拉撒力、尼甲沙利薛拉墨，并巴比伦王的一切官长，
{Jer 39:14} sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he lived among the people.
{Jer 39:14} 打发人去，将耶利米从护卫兵院中提出来，交与沙番的孙子亚希甘的儿子基大利，带回家去。于是耶利米住在民中。
{Jer 39:15} The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard:
{Jer 39:15} 耶利米还囚在护卫兵院中的时候，耶和华的话临到他说：
{Jer 39:16} "Go, and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will fulfill my words against this city for harm and not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day.
{Jer 39:16} “你去告诉古实人以伯米勒说，万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：我说降祸不降福的话必临到这城，到那时必在你面前成就了。
{Jer 39:17} But I will deliver you on that day, declares the LORD, and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
{Jer 39:17} 耶和华说：到那日我必拯救你，你必不至交在你所怕的人手中。
{Jer 39:18} For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me, declares the LORD.'"
{Jer 39:18} 我定要搭救你，你不至倒在刀下，却要以自己的命为掠物，因你倚靠我。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 40:1}  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he took him bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
{Jer 40:1}  耶利米锁在耶路撒冷和犹大被掳到巴比伦的人中，护卫长尼布撒拉旦将他从拉玛释放以后，耶和华的话临到耶利米。
{Jer 40:2}  The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, "The LORD your God pronounced this disaster against this place.
{Jer 40:2}  护卫长将耶利米叫来，对他说：“耶和华你的神曾说要降这祸与此地。
{Jer 40:3}  The LORD has brought it about, and has done as he said. Because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you.
{Jer 40:3}  耶和华使这祸临到，照他所说的行了；因为你们得罪耶和华，没有听从他的话，所以这事临到你们。
{Jer 40:4}  Now, behold, I release you today from the chains on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well, but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go.
{Jer 40:4}  现在我解开你手上的链子，你若看与我同往巴比伦去好，就可以去，我必厚待你；你若看与我同往巴比伦去不好，就不必去。看哪，全地在你面前，你以为那里美好，那里合宜，只管上那里去吧！”
{Jer 40:5}  If you remain, then return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever you think it right to go." So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go.
{Jer 40:5}  耶利米还没有回去，护卫长说：“你可以回到沙番的孙子亚希甘的儿子基大利那里去；现在巴比伦王立他作犹大城邑的省长。你可以在他那里住在民中，不然，你看那里合宜就可以上那里去。”于是护卫长送他粮食和礼物，释放他去了。
{Jer 40:6}  Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.
{Jer 40:6}  耶利米就到米斯巴见亚希甘的儿子基大利，在他那里住在境内剩下的民中。
{Jer 40:7}  When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon,
{Jer 40:7}  在田野的一切军长和属他们的人听见巴比伦王立了亚希甘的儿子基大利作境内的省长，并将没有掳到巴比伦的男人、妇女、孩童，和境内极穷的人全交给他。
{Jer 40:8}  they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah--Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
{Jer 40:8}  于是军长尼探雅的儿子以实玛利，加利亚的两个儿子约哈难和约拿单，单户篾的儿子西莱雅，并尼陀法人以斐的众子，玛迦人的儿子耶撒尼亚和属他们的人，都到米斯巴见基大利。
{Jer 40:9}  Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, "Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
{Jer 40:9}  沙番的孙子亚希甘的儿子基大利向他们和属他们的人起誓说：“不要怕服事迦勒底人，只管住在这地，服事巴比伦王，就可以得福。
{Jer 40:10} As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans who will come to us. But as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken."
{Jer 40:10} 至于我，我要住在米斯巴，伺候那到我们这里来的迦勒底人；只是你们当积蓄酒、油，和夏天的果子，收在器皿里，住在你们所占的城邑中。”
{Jer 40:11} Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them,
{Jer 40:11} 在摩押地和亚扪人中，在以东地和各国的一切犹大人，听见巴比伦王留下些犹大人，并立沙番的孙子亚希甘的儿子基大利管理他们。
{Jer 40:12} then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.
{Jer 40:12} 这一切犹大人就从所赶到的各处回来，到犹大地米斯巴的基大利那里，又积蓄了许多的酒，并夏天的果子。
{Jer 40:13} Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
{Jer 40:13} 加利亚的儿子约哈难和在田野的一切军长来到米斯巴见基大利，
{Jer 40:14} and said to him, "Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?" But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them.
{Jer 40:14} 对他说：“亚扪人的王巴利斯打发尼探雅的儿子以实玛利来要你的命，你知道吗？”亚希甘的儿子基大利却不信他们的话。
{Jer 40:15} Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, "Please let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?"
{Jer 40:15} 加利亚的儿子约哈难在米斯巴私下对基大利说：“求你容我去杀尼探雅的儿子以实玛利，必无人知道。何必让他要你的命，使聚集到你这里来的犹大人都分散，以致犹大剩下的人都灭亡呢？”
{Jer 40:16} But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, "You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael."
{Jer 40:16} 亚希甘的儿子基大利对加利亚的儿子约哈难说：“你不可行这事，你所论以实玛利的话是假的。”
{Jer 41:1}  In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. As they ate bread together there at Mizpah,
{Jer 41:1}  七月间，王的大臣宗室以利沙玛的孙子、尼探雅的儿子以实玛利带着十个人，来到米斯巴见亚希甘的儿子基大利。他们在米斯巴一同吃饭。
{Jer 41:2}  Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land.
{Jer 41:2}  尼探雅的儿子以实玛利和同他来的那十个人起来，用刀杀了沙番的孙子亚希甘的儿子基大利，就是巴比伦王所立为全地省长的。
{Jer 41:3}  Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.
{Jer 41:3}  以实玛利又杀了在米斯巴、基大利那里的一切犹大人和所遇见的迦勒底兵丁。
{Jer 41:4}  On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it,
{Jer 41:4}  他杀了基大利，无人知道。
{Jer 41:5}  eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the LORD.
{Jer 41:5}  第二天，有八十人从示剑和示罗，并撒玛利亚来，胡须剃去，衣服撕裂，身体划破，手拿素祭和乳香，要奉到耶和华的殿。
{Jer 41:6}  And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, "Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam."
{Jer 41:6}  尼探雅的儿子以实玛利出米斯巴迎接他们，随走随哭；遇见了他们，就对他们说：“你们可以来见亚希甘的儿子基大利。”
{Jer 41:7}  When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern.
{Jer 41:7}  他们到了城中，尼探雅的儿子以实玛利和同着他的人就将他们杀了，抛在坑中。
{Jer 41:8}  But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, "Do not put us to death, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields." So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions.
{Jer 41:8}  只是他们中间有十个人对以实玛利说：“不要杀我们，因为我们有许多大麦、小麦、油、蜜藏在田间。”于是他住了手，没有将他们杀在弟兄中间。
{Jer 41:9}  Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with Gedaliah was the large cistern that King Asa had made for defense against Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
{Jer 41:9}  以实玛利将所杀之人的尸首都抛在坑里基大利的旁边；这坑是从前亚撒王因怕以色列王巴沙所挖的。尼探雅的儿子以实玛利将那些被杀的人填满了坑。
{Jer 41:10} Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
{Jer 41:10} 以实玛利将米斯巴剩下的人，就是众公主和仍住在米斯巴所有的百姓，原是护卫长尼布撒拉旦交给亚希甘的儿子基大利的，都掳去了。尼探雅的儿子以实玛利掳了他们，要往亚扪人那里去。
{Jer 41:11} But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
{Jer 41:11} 加利亚的儿子约哈难和同着他的众军长听见尼探雅的儿子以实玛利所行的一切恶，
{Jer 41:12} they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at the great pool that is in Gibeon.
{Jer 41:12} 就带领众人前往，要和尼探雅的儿子以实玛利争战，在基遍的大水旁（或作：大水池旁）遇见他。
{Jer 41:13} And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced.
{Jer 41:13} 以实玛利那里的众人看见加利亚的儿子约哈难和同着他的众军长，就都欢喜。
{Jer 41:14} So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
{Jer 41:14} 这样，以实玛利从米斯巴所掳去的众人都转身归加利亚的儿子约哈难去了。
{Jer 41:15} But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
{Jer 41:15} 尼探雅的儿子以实玛利和八个人脱离约哈难的手，逃往亚扪人那里去了。
{Jer 41:16} Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam--soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from Gibeon.
{Jer 41:16} 尼探雅的儿子以实玛利杀了亚希甘的儿子基大利，从米斯巴将剩下的一切百姓、兵丁、妇女、孩童、太监掳到基遍之后，加利亚的儿子约哈难和同着他的众军长将他们都夺回来，
{Jer 41:17} And they went and stayed at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt
{Jer 41:17} 带到靠近伯利恒的金罕寓（或作：基罗特金罕）住下，要进入埃及去；
{Jer 41:18} because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
{Jer 41:18} 因为尼探雅的儿子以实玛利杀了巴比伦王所立为省长的亚希甘的儿子基大利，约哈难惧怕迦勒底人。
{Jer 42:1}  Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, came near
{Jer 42:1}  众军长和加利亚的儿子约哈难，并何沙雅的儿子耶撒尼亚（又名亚撒利雅，见四十三章二节）以及众百姓，从最小的到至大的都进前来，
{Jer 42:2}  and said to Jeremiah the prophet, "Let our plea for mercy come before you, and pray to the LORD your God for us, for all this remnant--because we are left with but a few, as your eyes see us--
{Jer 42:2}  对先知耶利米说：“求你准我们在你面前祈求，为我们这剩下的人祷告耶和华你的神。我们本来众多，现在剩下的极少，这是你亲眼所见的。
{Jer 42:3}  that the LORD your God may show us the way we should go, and the thing that we should do."
{Jer 42:3}  愿耶和华你的神指示我们所当走的路，所当做的事。”
{Jer 42:4}  Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your request, and whatever the LORD answers you I will tell you. I will keep nothing back from you."
{Jer 42:4}  先知耶利米对他们说：“我已经听见你们了，我必照着你们的话祷告耶和华你们的神。耶和华无论回答什么，我必都告诉你们，毫不隐瞒。”
{Jer 42:5}  Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to all the word with which the LORD your God sends you to us.
{Jer 42:5}  于是他们对耶利米说：“我们若不照耶和华你的神差遣你来说的一切话行，愿耶和华在我们中间作真实诚信的见证。
{Jer 42:6}  Whether it is good or bad, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God."
{Jer 42:6}  我们现在请你到耶和华我们的神面前，他说的无论是好是歹，我们都必听从；我们听从耶和华我们神的话，就可以得福。”
{Jer 42:7}  At the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
{Jer 42:7}  过了十天，耶和华的话临到耶利米。
{Jer 42:8}  Then he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest,
{Jer 42:8}  他就将加利亚的儿子约哈难和同着他的众军长，并众百姓，从最小的到至大的都叫了来，
{Jer 42:9}  and said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your plea for mercy before him:
{Jer 42:9}  对他们说：“耶和华以色列的神，就是你们请我在他面前为你们祈求的主，如此说：
{Jer 42:10} If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I relent of the disaster that I did to you.
{Jer 42:10} ‘你们若仍住在这地，我就建立你们，必不拆毁，栽植你们，并不拔出，因我为降与你们的灾祸后悔了。
{Jer 42:11} Do not fear the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Do not fear him, declares the LORD, for I am with you, to save you and to deliver you from his hand.
{Jer 42:11} 不要怕你们所怕的巴比伦王。’”耶和华说：“不要怕他！因为我与你们同在，要拯救你们脱离他的手。
{Jer 42:12} I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land.
{Jer 42:12} 我也要使他发怜悯，好怜悯你们，叫你们归回本地。
{Jer 42:13} But if you say, 'We will not remain in this land,' disobeying the voice of the LORD your God
{Jer 42:13} 倘若你们说：‘我们不住在这地’，以致不听从耶和华你们神的话，
{Jer 42:14} and saying, 'No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war or hear the sound of the trumpet or be hungry for bread, and we will dwell there,'
{Jer 42:14} 说：‘我们不住这地，却要进入埃及地，在那里看不见争战，听不见角声，也不至无食饥饿。我们必住在那里。’
{Jer 42:15} then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set your faces to enter Egypt and go to live there,
{Jer 42:15} 你们所剩下的犹大人哪，现在要听耶和华的话。万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘你们若定意要进入埃及，在那里寄居，
{Jer 42:16} then the sword that you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt, and there you shall die.
{Jer 42:16} 你们所惧怕的刀剑在埃及地必追上你们！你们所惧怕的饥荒在埃及要紧紧地跟随你们！你们必死在那里！
{Jer 42:17} All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. They shall have no remnant or survivor from the disaster that I will bring upon them.
{Jer 42:17} 凡定意要进入埃及在那里寄居的必遭刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫而死，无一人存留，逃脱我所降与他们的灾祸。’
{Jer 42:18} "For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You shall become an execration, a horror, a curse, and a taunt. You shall see this place no more.
{Jer 42:18} “万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘我怎样将我的怒气和忿怒倾在耶路撒冷的居民身上，你们进入埃及的时候，我也必照样将我的忿怒倾在你们身上，以致你们令人辱骂、惊骇、咒诅、羞辱，你们不得再见这地方。’
{Jer 42:19} The LORD has said to you, O remnant of Judah, 'Do not go to Egypt.' Know for a certainty that I have warned you this day
{Jer 42:19} 所剩下的犹大人哪，耶和华论到你们说：‘不要进入埃及去。’你们要确实地知道我今日警教你们了。
{Jer 42:20} that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives. For you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, 'Pray for us to the LORD our God, and whatever the LORD our God says declare to us and we will do it.'
{Jer 42:20} 你们行诡诈自害；因为你们请我到耶和华你们的神那里，说：‘求你为我们祷告耶和华我们神，照耶和华我们的神一切所说的告诉我们，我们就必遵行。’
{Jer 42:21} And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in anything that he sent me to tell you.
{Jer 42:21} 我今日将这话告诉你们，耶和华你们的神为你们的事差遣我到你们那里说的，你们却一样没有听从。
{Jer 42:22} Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live."
{Jer 42:22} 现在你们要确实地知道，你们在所要去寄居之地必遭刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫而死。”
{Jer 43:1}  When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the LORD their God, with which the LORD their God had sent him to them,
{Jer 43:1}  耶利米向众百姓说完了耶和华他们神的一切话，就是耶和华他们神差遣他去所说的一切话。
{Jer 43:2}  Azariah the son of Hoshaiah and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the insolent men said to Jeremiah, "You are telling a lie. The LORD our God did not send you to say, 'Do not go to Egypt to live there,'
{Jer 43:2}  何沙雅的儿子亚撒利雅和加利亚的儿子约哈难，并一切狂傲的人，就对耶利米说：“你说谎言！耶和华我们的神并没有差遣你来说：‘你们不可进入埃及，在那里寄居。’
{Jer 43:3}  but Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon."
{Jer 43:3}  这是尼利亚的儿子巴录挑唆你害我们，要将我们交在迦勒底人的手中，使我们有被杀的，有被掳到巴比伦去的。”
{Jer 43:4}  So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the LORD, to remain in the land of Judah.
{Jer 43:4}  于是加利亚的儿子约哈难和一切军长，并众百姓，不听从耶和华的话住在犹大地。
{Jer 43:5}  But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven--
{Jer 43:5}  加利亚的儿子约哈难和一切军长却将所剩下的犹大人，就是从被赶到各国回来在犹大地寄居的男人、妇女、孩童，和众公主，并护卫长尼布撒拉旦所留在沙番的孙子亚希甘的儿子基大利那里的众人，与先知耶利米，以及尼利亚的儿子巴录，
{Jer 43:6}  the men, the women, the children, the princesses, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan; also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah.
{Jer 43:6}  (SEE 43:5)
{Jer 43:7}  And they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the LORD. And they arrived at Tahpanhes.
{Jer 43:7}  都带入埃及地，到了答比匿。这是因他们不听从耶和华的话。
{Jer 43:8}  Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes:
{Jer 43:8}  在答比匿，耶和华的话临到耶利米说：
{Jer 43:9}  "Take in your hands large stones and hide them in the mortar in the pavement that is at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah,
{Jer 43:9}  “你在犹大人眼前要用手拿几块大石头，藏在砌砖的灰泥中，就是在答比匿法老的宫门那里，
{Jer 43:10} and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden, and he will spread his royal canopy over them.
{Jer 43:10} 对他们说：‘万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：我必召我的仆人巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒来。在所藏的石头上我要安置他的宝座；他必将光华的宝帐支搭在其上。
{Jer 43:11} He shall come and strike the land of Egypt, giving over to the pestilence those who are doomed to the pestilence, to captivity those who are doomed to captivity, and to the sword those who are doomed to the sword.
{Jer 43:11} 他要来攻击埃及地，定为死亡的，必致死亡；定为掳掠的，必被掳掠；定为刀杀的，必交刀杀。
{Jer 43:12} I shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them and carry them away captive. And he shall clean the land of Egypt as a shepherd cleans his cloak of vermin, and he shall go away from there in peace.
{Jer 43:12} 我要在埃及神的庙中使火着起，巴比伦王要将庙宇焚烧，神像掳去；他要得（原文作披上）埃及地，好像牧人披上外衣，从那里安然而去。
{Jer 43:13} He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt, and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.'"
{Jer 43:13} 他必打碎埃及地伯示麦的柱像，用火焚烧埃及神的庙宇。’”
{Jer 44:1}  The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who lived in the land of Egypt, at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Memphis, and in the land of Pathros,
{Jer 44:1}  有临到耶利米的话，论及一切住在埃及地的犹大人，就是住在密夺、答比匿、挪弗、巴忒罗境内的犹大人，说：
{Jer 44:2}  "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the disaster that I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah. Behold, this day they are a desolation, and no one dwells in them,
{Jer 44:2}  “万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：我所降与耶路撒冷和犹大各城的一切灾祸你们都看见了。那些城邑今日荒凉，无人居住；
{Jer 44:3}  because of the evil that they committed, provoking me to anger, in that they went to make offerings and serve other gods that they knew not, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.
{Jer 44:3}  这是因居民所行的恶，去烧香事奉别神，就是他们和你们，并你们列祖所不认识的神，惹我发怒。
{Jer 44:4}  Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying, 'Oh, do not do this abomination that I hate!'
{Jer 44:4}  我从早起来差遣我的仆人众先知去说，你们切不要行我所厌恶这可憎之事。
{Jer 44:5}  But they did not listen or incline their ear, to turn from their evil and make no offerings to other gods.
{Jer 44:5}  他们却不听从，不侧耳而听，不转离恶事，仍向别神烧香。
{Jer 44:6}  Therefore my wrath and my anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became a waste and a desolation, as at this day.
{Jer 44:6}  因此，我的怒气和忿怒都倒出来，在犹大城邑中和耶路撒冷的街市上，如火着起，以致都荒废凄凉，正如今日一样。
{Jer 44:7}  And now thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and child, from the midst of Judah, leaving you no remnant?
{Jer 44:7}  现在耶和华万军之神、以色列的神如此说：你们为何作这大恶自害己命，使你们的男人、妇女、婴孩，和吃奶的都从犹大中剪除、不留一人呢？
{Jer 44:8}  Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, making offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live, so that you may be cut off and become a curse and a taunt among all the nations of the earth?
{Jer 44:8}  就是因你们手所做的，在所去寄居的埃及地向别神烧香惹我发怒，使你们被剪除，在天下万国中令人咒诅羞辱。
{Jer 44:9}  Have you forgotten the evil of your fathers, the evil of the kings of Judah, the evil of their wives, your own evil, and the evil of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
{Jer 44:9}  你们列祖的恶行，犹大列王和他们后妃的恶行，你们自己和你们妻子的恶行，就是在犹大地、耶路撒冷街上所行的，你们都忘了吗？
{Jer 44:10} They have not humbled themselves even to this day, nor have they feared, nor walked in my law and my statutes that I set before you and before your fathers.
{Jer 44:10} 到如今还没有懊悔，没有惧怕，没有遵行我在你们和你们列祖面前所设立的法度律例。
{Jer 44:11} "Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for harm, to cut off all Judah.
{Jer 44:11} “所以万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：我必向你们变脸降灾，以致剪除犹大众人。
{Jer 44:12} I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to come to the land of Egypt to live, and they shall all be consumed. In the land of Egypt they shall fall; by the sword and by famine they shall be consumed. From the least to the greatest, they shall die by the sword and by famine, and they shall become an oath, a horror, a curse, and a taunt.
{Jer 44:12} 那定意进入埃及地、在那里寄居的，就是所剩下的犹大人，我必使他们尽都灭绝，必在埃及地仆倒，必因刀剑饥荒灭绝；从最小的到至大的都必遭刀剑饥荒而死，以致令人辱骂、惊骇、咒诅、羞辱。
{Jer 44:13} I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence,
{Jer 44:13} 我怎样用刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫刑罚耶路撒冷，也必照样刑罚那些住在埃及地的犹大人；
{Jer 44:14} so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to live in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah, to which they desire to return to dwell there. For they shall not return, except some fugitives."
{Jer 44:14} 甚至那进入埃及地寄居的，就是所剩下的犹大人，都不得逃脱，也不得存留归回犹大地。他们心中甚想归回居住之地；除了逃脱的以外，一个都不能归回。”
{Jer 44:15} Then all the men who knew that their wives had made offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the people who lived in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah:
{Jer 44:15} 那些住在埃及地巴忒罗知道自己妻子向别神烧香的，与旁边站立的众妇女，聚集成群，回答耶利米说：
{Jer 44:16} "As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you.
{Jer 44:16} “论到你奉耶和华的名向我们所说的话，我们必不听从。
{Jer 44:17} But we will do everything that we have vowed, make offerings to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our officials, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no disaster.
{Jer 44:17} 我们定要成就我们口中所出的一切话，向天后烧香、浇奠祭，按着我们与我们列祖、君王、首领在犹大的城邑中和耶路撒冷的街市上素常所行的一样；因为那时我们吃饱饭、享福乐，并不见灾祸。
{Jer 44:18} But since we left off making offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine."
{Jer 44:18} 自从我们停止向天后烧香、浇奠祭，我们倒缺乏一切，又因刀剑饥荒灭绝。”
{Jer 44:19} And the women said, "When we made offerings to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands' approval that we made cakes for her bearing her image and poured out drink offerings to her?"
{Jer 44:19} 妇女说：“我们向天后烧香、浇奠祭，做天后像的饼供奉他，向他浇奠祭，是外乎我们的丈夫吗？”
{Jer 44:20} Then Jeremiah said to all the people, men and women, all the people who had given him this answer:
{Jer 44:20} 耶利米对一切那样回答他的男人妇女说：
{Jer 44:21} "As for the offerings that you offered in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your officials, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them? Did it not come into his mind?
{Jer 44:21} “你们与你们列祖、君王、首领，并国内的百姓，在犹大城邑中和耶路撒冷街市上所烧的香，耶和华岂不记念，心中岂不思想吗？
{Jer 44:22} The LORD could no longer bear your evil deeds and the abominations that you committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation and a waste and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
{Jer 44:22} 耶和华因你们所作的恶、所行可憎的事，不能再容忍，所以你们的地荒凉，令人惊骇咒诅，无人居住，正如今日一样。
{Jer 44:23} It is because you made offerings and because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey the voice of the LORD or walk in his law and in his statutes and in his testimonies that this disaster has happened to you, as at this day."
{Jer 44:23} 你们烧香，得罪耶和华，没有听从他的话，没有遵行他的律法、条例、法度，所以你们遭遇这灾祸，正如今日一样。”
{Jer 44:24} Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
{Jer 44:24} 耶利米又对众民和众妇女说：“你们在埃及地的一切犹大人当听耶和华的话。
{Jer 44:25} Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have declared with your mouths, and have fulfilled it with your hands, saying, 'We will surely perform our vows that we have made, to make offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.' Then confirm your vows and perform your vows!
{Jer 44:25} 万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：你们和你们的妻都口中说、手里做，说：‘我们定要偿还所许的愿，向天后烧香、浇奠祭。’现在你们只管坚定所许的愿而偿还吧！
{Jer 44:26} Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the LORD, that my name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, 'As the Lord GOD lives.'
{Jer 44:26} 所以你们住在埃及地的一切犹大人当听耶和华的话。耶和华说：我指着我的大名起誓，在埃及全地，我的名不再被犹大一个人的口称呼说：‘我指着主永生的耶和华起誓。’
{Jer 44:27} Behold, I am watching over them for disaster and not for good. All the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end of them.
{Jer 44:27} 我向他们留意降祸不降福；在埃及地的一切犹大人必因刀剑、饥荒所灭，直到灭尽。
{Jer 44:28} And those who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who came to the land of Egypt to live, shall know whose word will stand, mine or theirs.
{Jer 44:28} 脱离刀剑、从埃及地归回犹大地的人数很少；那进入埃及地要在那里寄居的，就是所剩下的犹大人，必知道是谁的话立得住，是我的话呢？是他们的话呢？
{Jer 44:29} This shall be the sign to you, declares the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, in order that you may know that my words will surely stand against you for harm:
{Jer 44:29} 耶和华说：我在这地方刑罚你们，必有预兆，使你们知道我降祸与你们的话必要立得住。
{Jer 44:30} Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and sought his life."
{Jer 44:30} 耶和华如此说：我必将埃及王法老合弗拉交在他仇敌和寻索其命的人手中，像我将犹大王西底家交在他仇敌和寻索其命的巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒手中一样。”
{Jer 45:1}  The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
{Jer 45:1}  犹大王约西亚的儿子约雅敬第四年，尼利亚的儿子巴录将先知耶利米口中所说的话写在书上。耶利米说：
{Jer 45:2}  "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
{Jer 45:2}  “巴录啊，耶和华以色列的神说：
{Jer 45:3}  You said, 'Woe is me! For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain. I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.'
{Jer 45:3}  巴录（原文作你）曾说：‘哀哉！耶和华将忧愁加在我的痛苦上，我因唉哼而困乏，不得安歇。’
{Jer 45:4}  Thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD: Behold, what I have built I am breaking down, and what I have planted I am plucking up--that is, the whole land.
{Jer 45:4}  你要这样告诉他，耶和华如此说：我所建立的，我必拆毁；我所栽植的，我必拔出；在全地我都如此行。
{Jer 45:5}  And do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not, for behold, I am bringing disaster upon all flesh, declares the LORD. But I will give you your life as a prize of war in all places to which you may go."
{Jer 45:5}  你为自己图谋大事吗？不要图谋！我必使灾祸临到凡有血气的。但你无论往那里去，我必使你以自己的命为掠物。这是耶和华说的。”
{Jer 46:1}  The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
{Jer 46:1}  耶和华论列国的话临到先知耶利米。
{Jer 46:2}  About Egypt. Concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish and which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
{Jer 46:2}  论到关乎埃及王法老尼哥的军队：这军队安营在伯拉河边的迦基米施，是巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒在犹大王约西亚的儿子约雅敬第四年所打败的。
{Jer 46:3}  "Prepare buckler and shield, and advance for battle!
{Jer 46:3}  你们要预备大小盾牌，往前上阵。
{Jer 46:4}  Harness the horses; mount, O horsemen! Take your stations with your helmets, polish your spears, put on your armor!
{Jer 46:4}  你们套上车，骑上马！顶盔站立，磨枪贯甲！
{Jer 46:5}  Why have I seen it? They are dismayed and have turned backward. Their warriors are beaten down and have fled in haste; they look not back-- terror on every side! declares the LORD.
{Jer 46:5}  我为何看见他们惊惶转身退后呢？他们的勇士打败了，急忙逃跑，并不回头；惊吓四围都有！这是耶和华说的。
{Jer 46:6}  "The swift cannot flee away, nor the warrior escape; in the north by the river Euphrates they have stumbled and fallen.
{Jer 46:6}  不要容快跑的逃避；不要容勇士逃脱（或作：快跑的不能逃避；勇士不能逃脱）；他们在北方伯拉河边绊跌仆倒。
{Jer 46:7}  "Who is this, rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters surge?
{Jer 46:7}  像尼罗河涨发，像江河之水翻腾的是谁呢？
{Jer 46:8}  Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers whose waters surge. He said, 'I will rise, I will cover the earth, I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.'
{Jer 46:8}  埃及像尼罗河涨发，像江河的水翻腾。他说：我要涨发遮盖遍地；我要毁灭城邑和其中的居民。
{Jer 46:9}  Advance, O horses, and rage, O chariots! Let the warriors go out: men of Cush and Put who handle the shield, men of Lud, skilled in handling the bow.
{Jer 46:9}  马匹上去吧！车辆急行吧！勇士，就是手拿盾牌的古实人和弗人（又作吕彼亚人），并拉弓的路德族，都出去吧！
{Jer 46:10} That day is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, to avenge himself on his foes. The sword shall devour and be sated and drink its fill of their blood. For the Lord GOD of hosts holds a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
{Jer 46:10} 那日是主万军之耶和华报仇的日子，要向敌人报仇。刀剑必吞吃得饱，饮血饮足；因为主万军之耶和华在北方伯拉河边有献祭的事。
{Jer 46:11} Go up to Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain you have used many medicines; there is no healing for you.
{Jer 46:11} 埃及的民（原文作处女）哪，可以上基列取乳香去；你虽多服良药，总是徒然，不得治好。
{Jer 46:12} The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for warrior has stumbled against warrior; they have both fallen together."
{Jer 46:12} 列国听见你的羞辱，遍地满了你的哀声；勇士与勇士彼此相碰，一齐跌倒。
{Jer 46:13} The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to strike the land of Egypt:
{Jer 46:13} 耶和华对先知耶利米所说的话，论到巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒要来攻击埃及地：
{Jer 46:14} "Declare in Egypt, and proclaim in Migdol; proclaim in Memphis and Tahpanhes; say, 'Stand ready and be prepared, for the sword shall devour around you.'
{Jer 46:14} 你们要传扬在埃及，宣告在密夺，报告在挪弗、答比匿说：要站起出队，自作准备，因为刀剑在你四围施行吞灭的事。
{Jer 46:15} Why are your mighty ones face down? They do not stand because the LORD thrust them down.
{Jer 46:15} 你的壮士为何被冲去呢？他们站立不住；因为耶和华驱逐他们，
{Jer 46:16} He made many stumble, and they fell, and they said one to another, 'Arise, and let us go back to our own people and to the land of our birth, because of the sword of the oppressor.'
{Jer 46:16} 使多人绊跌；他们也彼此撞倒，说：起来吧！我们再往本民本地去，好躲避欺压的刀剑。
{Jer 46:17} Call the name of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, 'Noisy one who lets the hour go by.'
{Jer 46:17} 他们在那里喊叫说：埃及王法老不过是个声音（或作：已经败亡）；他已错过所定的时候了。
{Jer 46:18} "As I live, declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea, shall one come.
{Jer 46:18} 君王名为万军之耶和华的说：我指着我的永生起誓：尼布甲尼撒（原文作他）来的势派必像他泊在众山之中，像迦密在海边一样。
{Jer 46:19} Prepare yourselves baggage for exile, O inhabitants of Egypt! For Memphis shall become a waste, a ruin, without inhabitant.
{Jer 46:19} 住在埃及的民哪（原文作女子），要预备掳去时所用的物件；因为挪弗必成为荒场，且被烧毁，无人居住。
{Jer 46:20} "A beautiful heifer is Egypt, but a biting fly from the north has come upon her.
{Jer 46:20} 埃及是肥美的母牛犊；但出于北方的毁灭（或作：牛）来到了！来到了！
{Jer 46:21} Even her hired soldiers in her midst are like fattened calves; yes, they have turned and fled together; they did not stand, for the day of their calamity has come upon them, the time of their punishment.
{Jer 46:21} 其中的雇勇好像圈里的肥牛犊，他们转身退后，一齐逃跑，站立不住；因为他们遭难的日子、追讨的时候已经临到。
{Jer 46:22} "She makes a sound like a serpent gliding away; for her enemies march in force and come against her with axes like those who fell trees.
{Jer 46:22} 其中的声音好像蛇行一样。敌人要成队而来，如砍伐树木的手拿斧子攻击他。
{Jer 46:23} They shall cut down her forest, declares the LORD, though it is impenetrable, because they are more numerous than locusts; they are without number.
{Jer 46:23} 耶和华说：埃及的树林虽然不能寻察（或作：穿不过），敌人却要砍伐，因他们多于蝗虫，不可胜数。
{Jer 46:24} The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame; she shall be delivered into the hand of a people from the north."
{Jer 46:24} 埃及的民（原文作女子）必然蒙羞，必交在北方人的手中。
{Jer 46:25} The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, said: "Behold, I am bringing punishment upon Amon of Thebes, and Pharaoh and Egypt and her gods and her kings, upon Pharaoh and those who trust in him.
{Jer 46:25} 万军之耶和华以色列的神说：“我必刑罚挪的亚扪（埃及尊大之神）和法老，并埃及与埃及的神，以及君王，也必刑罚法老和倚靠他的人。
{Jer 46:26} I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their life, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Afterward Egypt shall be inhabited as in the days of old, declares the LORD.
{Jer 46:26} 我要将他们交付寻索其命之人的手和巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒与他臣仆的手；以后埃及必再有人居住，与从前一样。这是耶和华说的。”
