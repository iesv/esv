{2Ki 1:1}   After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.
{2Ki 1:1}   亚哈死后，摩押背叛以色列。
{2Ki 1:2}   Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, "Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness."
{2Ki 1:2}   亚哈谢在撒玛利亚，一日从楼上的栏杆里掉下来，就病了；于是差遣使者说：“你们去问以革伦的神巴力西卜，我这病能好不能好。”
{2Ki 1:3}   But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?
{2Ki 1:3}   但耶和华的使者对提斯比人以利亚说：“你起来，去迎着撒玛利亚王的使者，对他们说：‘你们去问以革伦神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有神吗？’
{2Ki 1:4}   Now therefore thus says the LORD, You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.'" So Elijah went.
{2Ki 1:4}   所以耶和华如此说：‘你必不下你所上的床，必定要死！’”以利亚就去了。
{2Ki 1:5}   The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, "Why have you returned?"
{2Ki 1:5}   使者回来见王，王问他们说：“你们为什么回来呢？”
{2Ki 1:6}   And they said to him, "There came a man to meet us, and said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the LORD, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.'"
{2Ki 1:6}   使者回答说：“有一个人迎着我们来，对我们说：‘你们回去见差你们来的王，对他说：耶和华如此说，你差人去问以革伦神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有神吗？所以你必不下所上的床，必定要死。’”
{2Ki 1:7}   He said to them, "What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?"
{2Ki 1:7}   王问他们说：“迎着你们来告诉你们这话的，是怎样的人？”
{2Ki 1:8}   They answered him, "He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist." And he said, "It is Elijah the Tishbite."
{2Ki 1:8}   回答说：“他身穿毛衣，腰束皮带。”王说：“这必是提斯比人以利亚。”
{2Ki 1:9}   Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "O man of God, the king says, 'Come down.'"
{2Ki 1:9}   于是，王差遣五十夫长，带领五十人去见以利亚，他就上到以利亚那里；以利亚正坐在山顶上。五十夫长对他说：“神人哪，王吩咐你下来！”
{2Ki 1:10}  But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
{2Ki 1:10}  以利亚回答说：“我若是神人，愿火从天上降下来，烧灭你和你那五十人！”于是有火从天上降下来，烧灭五十夫长和他那五十人。
{2Ki 1:11}  Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, "O man of God, this is the king's order, 'Come down quickly!'"
{2Ki 1:11}  王第二次差遣一个五十夫长，带领五十人去见以利亚。五十夫长对以利亚说：“神人哪，王吩咐你快快下来！”
{2Ki 1:12}  But Elijah answered them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
{2Ki 1:12}  以利亚回答说：“我若是神人，愿火从天上降下来，烧灭你和你那五十人！”于是神的火从天上降下来，烧灭五十夫长和他那五十人。
{2Ki 1:13}  Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and entreated him, "O man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in your sight.
{2Ki 1:13}  王第三次差遣一个五十夫长，带领五十人去。这五十夫长上去，双膝跪在以利亚面前，哀求他说：“神人哪，愿我的性命和你这五十个仆人的性命在你眼前看为宝贵！
{2Ki 1:14}  Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties, but now let my life be precious in your sight."
{2Ki 1:14}  已经有火从天上降下来，烧灭前两次来的五十夫长和他们各自带的五十人；现在愿我的性命在你眼前看为宝贵！”
{2Ki 1:15}  Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So he arose and went down with him to the king
{2Ki 1:15}  耶和华的使者对以利亚说：“你同着他下去，不要怕他！”以利亚就起来，同着他下去见王，
{2Ki 1:16}  and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron--is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?--therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.'"
{2Ki 1:16}  对王说：“耶和华如此说：‘你差人去问以革伦神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有神可以求问吗？所以你必不下所上的床，必定要死！’”
{2Ki 1:17}  So he died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.
{2Ki 1:17}  亚哈谢果然死了，正如耶和华藉以利亚所说的话。因他没有儿子，他兄弟约兰接续他作王，正在犹大王约沙法的儿子约兰第二年。
{2Ki 1:18}  Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{2Ki 1:18}  亚哈谢其余所行的事都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ki 2:1}   Now when the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.
{2Ki 2:1}   耶和华要用旋风接以利亚升天的时候，以利亚与以利沙从吉甲前往。
{2Ki 2:2}   And Elijah said to Elisha, "Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel." But Elisha said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.
{2Ki 2:2}   以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差我往伯特利去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人下到伯特利。
{2Ki 2:3}   And the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, "Do you know that today the LORD will take away your master from over you?" And he said, "Yes, I know it; keep quiet."
{2Ki 2:3}   住伯特利的先知门徒出来见以利沙，对他说：“耶和华今日要接你的师傅离开你，你知道不知道？”他说：“我知道，你们不要作声。”
{2Ki 2:4}   Elijah said to him, "Elisha, please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to Jericho." But he said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they came to Jericho.
{2Ki 2:4}   以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差遣我往耶利哥去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人到了耶利哥。
{2Ki 2:5}   The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha and said to him, "Do you know that today the LORD will take away your master from over you?" And he answered, "Yes, I know it; keep quiet."
{2Ki 2:5}   住耶利哥的先知门徒就近以利沙，对他说：“耶和华今日要接你的师傅离开你，你知道不知道？”他说：“我知道，你们不要作声。”
{2Ki 2:6}   Then Elijah said to him, "Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." But he said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So the two of them went on.
{2Ki 2:6}   以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差遣我往约但河去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人一同前往。
{2Ki 2:7}   Fifty men of the sons of the prophets also went and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan.
{2Ki 2:7}   有先知门徒去了五十人，远远的站在他们对面；二人在约但河边站住。
{2Ki 2:8}   Then Elijah took his cloak and rolled it up and struck the water, and the water was parted to the one side and to the other, till the two of them could go over on dry ground.
{2Ki 2:8}   以利亚将自己的外衣卷起来，用以打水，水就左右分开，二人走干地而过。
{2Ki 2:9}   When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you." And Elisha said, "Please let there be a double portion of your spirit on me."
{2Ki 2:9}   过去之后，以利亚对以利沙说：“我未曾被接去离开你，你要我为你做什么，只管求我。”以利沙说：“愿感动你的灵加倍地感动我。”
{2Ki 2:10}  And he said, "You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it shall be so for you, but if you do not see me, it shall not be so."
{2Ki 2:10}  以利亚说：“你所求的难得。虽然如此，我被接去离开你的时候，你若看见我，就必得着；不然，必得不着了。”
{2Ki 2:11}  And as they still went on and talked, behold, chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
{2Ki 2:11}  他们正走着说话，忽有火车火马将二人隔开，以利亚就乘旋风升天去了。
{2Ki 2:12}  And Elisha saw it and he cried, "My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!" And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.
{2Ki 2:12}  以利沙看见，就呼叫说：“我父啊！我父啊！以色列的战车马兵啊！”以后不再见他了。于是以利沙把自己的衣服撕为两片。
{2Ki 2:13}  And he took up the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
{2Ki 2:13}  他拾起以利亚身上掉下来的外衣，回去站在约但河边。
{2Ki 2:14}  Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water, saying, "Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" And when he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.
{2Ki 2:14}  他用以利亚身上掉下来的外衣打水，说：“耶和华以利亚的神在那里呢？”打水之后，水也左右分开，以利沙就过来了。
{2Ki 2:15}  Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him opposite them, they said, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha." And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
{2Ki 2:15}  住耶利哥的先知门徒从对面看见他，就说：“感动以利亚的灵感动以利沙了。”他们就来迎接他，在他面前俯伏于地，
{2Ki 2:16}  And they said to him, "Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. It may be that the Spirit of the LORD has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley." And he said, "You shall not send."
{2Ki 2:16}  对他说：“仆人们这里有五十个壮士，求你容他们去寻找你师傅，或者耶和华的灵将他提起来，投在某山某谷。”以利沙说：“你们不必打发人去。”
{2Ki 2:17}  But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, "Send." They sent therefore fifty men. And for three days they sought him but did not find him.
{2Ki 2:17}  他们再三催促他，他难以推辞，就说：“你们打发人去吧！”他们便打发五十人去，寻找了三天，也没有找着。
{2Ki 2:18}  And they came back to him while he was staying at Jericho, and he said to them, "Did I not say to you, 'Do not go'?"
{2Ki 2:18}  以利沙仍然在耶利哥等候他们回到他那里；他对他们说：“我岂没有告诉你们不必去吗？”
{2Ki 2:19}  Now the men of the city said to Elisha, "Behold, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees, but the water is bad, and the land is unfruitful."
{2Ki 2:19}  耶利哥城的人对以利沙说：“这城的地势美好，我主看见了；只是水恶劣，土产不熟而落。”
{2Ki 2:20}  He said, "Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.
{2Ki 2:20}  以利沙说：“你们拿一个新瓶来，装盐给我”；他们就拿来给他。
{2Ki 2:21}  Then he went to the spring of water and threw salt in it and said, "Thus says the LORD, I have healed this water; from now on neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it."
{2Ki 2:21}  他出到水源，将盐倒在水中，说：“耶和华如此说：‘我治好了这水，从此必不再使人死，也不再使地土不生产。’”
{2Ki 2:22}  So the water has been healed to this day, according to the word that Elisha spoke.
{2Ki 2:22}  于是那水治好了，直到今日，正如以利沙所说的。
{2Ki 2:23}  He went up from there to Bethel, and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, "Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!"
{2Ki 2:23}  以利沙从那里上伯特利去，正上去的时候，有些童子从城里出来，戏笑他说：“秃头的上去吧！秃头的上去吧！”
{2Ki 2:24}  And he turned around, and when he saw them, he cursed them in the name of the LORD. And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys.
{2Ki 2:24}  他回头看见，就奉耶和华的名咒诅他们。于是有两个母熊从林中出来，撕裂他们中间四十二个童子。
{2Ki 2:25}  From there he went on to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
{2Ki 2:25}  以利沙从伯特利上迦密山，又从迦密山回到撒玛利亚。
{2Ki 3:1}   In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twelve years.
{2Ki 3:1}   犹大王约沙法十八年，亚哈的儿子约兰在撒玛利亚登基作了以色列王十二年。
{2Ki 3:2}   He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, though not like his father and mother, for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
{2Ki 3:2}   他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，但不至像他父母所行的，因为除掉他父所造巴力的柱像。
{2Ki 3:3}   Nevertheless, he clung to the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from it.
{2Ki 3:3}   然而，他贴近尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，总不离开。
{2Ki 3:4}   Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he had to deliver to the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams.
{2Ki 3:4}   摩押王米沙牧养许多羊，每年将十万羊羔的毛和十万公绵羊的毛给以色列王进贡。
{2Ki 3:5}   But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
{2Ki 3:5}   亚哈死后，摩押王背叛以色列王。
{2Ki 3:6}   So King Jehoram marched out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.
{2Ki 3:6}   那时约兰王出撒玛利亚，数点以色列众人。
{2Ki 3:7}   And he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to battle against Moab?" And he said, "I will go. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
{2Ki 3:7}   前行的时候，差人去见犹大王约沙法，说：“摩押王背叛我，你肯同我去攻打摩押吗？”他说：“我肯上去，你我不分彼此，我的民与你的民一样，我的马与你的马一样。”
{2Ki 3:8}   Then he said, "By which way shall we march?" Jehoram answered, "By the way of the wilderness of Edom."
{2Ki 3:8}   约兰说：“我们从那条路上去呢？”回答说：“从以东旷野的路上去。”
{2Ki 3:9}   So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. And when they had made a circuitous march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.
{2Ki 3:9}   于是，以色列王和犹大王，并以东王，都一同去绕行七日的路程；军队和所带的牲畜没有水喝。
{2Ki 3:10}  Then the king of Israel said, "Alas! The LORD has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab."
{2Ki 3:10}  以色列王说：“哀哉！耶和华招聚我们这三王，乃要交在摩押人的手里。”
{2Ki 3:11}  And Jehoshaphat said, "Is there no prophet of the LORD here, through whom we may inquire of the LORD?" Then one of the king of Israel's servants answered, "Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah."
{2Ki 3:11}  约沙法说：“这里不是有耶和华的先知吗？我们可以托他求问耶和华。”以色列王的一个臣子回答说：“这里有沙法的儿子以利沙，就是从前服事以利亚的（原文作倒水在以利亚手上的）。”
{2Ki 3:12}  And Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
{2Ki 3:12}  约沙法说：“他必有耶和华的话。”于是以色列王和约沙法，并以东王都下去见他。
{2Ki 3:13}  And Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother." But the king of Israel said to him, "No; it is the LORD who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab."
{2Ki 3:13}  以利沙对以色列王说：“我与你何干？去问你父亲的先知和你母亲的先知吧！”以色列王对他说：“不要这样说，耶和华招聚我们这三王，乃要交在摩押人的手里。”
{2Ki 3:14}  And Elisha said, "As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not that I have regard for Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would neither look at you nor see you.
{2Ki 3:14}  以利沙说：“我指着所事奉永生的万军耶和华起誓，我若不看犹大王约沙法的情面，必不理你，不顾你。
{2Ki 3:15}  But now bring me a musician." And when the musician played, the hand of the LORD came upon him.
{2Ki 3:15}  现在你们给我找一个弹琴的来。”弹琴的时候，耶和华的灵（原文作手）就降在以利沙身上。
{2Ki 3:16}  And he said, "Thus says the LORD, 'I will make this dry streambed full of pools.'
{2Ki 3:16}  他便说：“耶和华如此说：‘你们要在这谷中满处挖沟；
{2Ki 3:17}  For thus says the LORD, 'You shall not see wind or rain, but that streambed shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, you, your livestock, and your animals.'
{2Ki 3:17}  因为耶和华如此说：你们虽不见风，不见雨，这谷必满了水，使你们和牲畜有水喝。’
{2Ki 3:18}  This is a light thing in the sight of the LORD. He will also give the Moabites into your hand,
{2Ki 3:18}  在耶和华眼中这还算为小事，他也必将摩押人交在你们手中。
{2Ki 3:19}  and you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree and stop up all springs of water and ruin every good piece of land with stones."
{2Ki 3:19}  你们必攻破一切坚城美邑，砍伐各种佳树，塞住一切水泉，用石头糟踏一切美田。”
{2Ki 3:20}  The next morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came from the direction of Edom, till the country was filled with water.
{2Ki 3:20}  次日早晨，约在献祭的时候，有水从以东而来，遍地就满了水。
{2Ki 3:21}  When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to put on armor, from the youngest to the oldest, were called out and were drawn up at the border.
{2Ki 3:21}  摩押众人听见这三王上来要与他们争战，凡能顶盔贯甲的，无论老少，尽都聚集站在边界上。
{2Ki 3:22}  And when they rose early in the morning and the sun shone on the water, the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.
{2Ki 3:22}  次日早晨，日光照在水上，摩押人起来，看见对面水红如血，
{2Ki 3:23}  And they said, "This is blood; the kings have surely fought together and struck one another down. Now then, Moab, to the spoil!"
{2Ki 3:23}  就说：“这是血啊！必是三王互相击杀，俱都灭亡。摩押人哪，我们现在去抢夺财物吧！”
{2Ki 3:24}  But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and struck the Moabites, till they fled before them. And they went forward, striking the Moabites as they went.
{2Ki 3:24}  摩押人到了以色列营，以色列人就起来攻打他们，以致他们在以色列人面前逃跑。以色列人往前追杀摩押人，直杀入摩押的境内，
{2Ki 3:25}  And they overthrew the cities, and on every good piece of land every man threw a stone until it was covered. They stopped every spring of water and felled all the good trees, till only its stones were left in Kir-hareseth, and the slingers surrounded and attacked it.
{2Ki 3:25}  拆毁摩押的城邑，各人抛石填满一切美田，塞住一切水泉，砍伐各种佳树，只剩下吉珥哈列设的石墙；甩石的兵在四围攻打那城。
{2Ki 3:26}  When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him, he took with him 700 swordsmen to break through, opposite the king of Edom, but they could not.
{2Ki 3:26}  摩押王见阵势甚大，难以对敌，就率领七百拿刀的兵，要冲过阵去到以东王那里，却是不能；
{2Ki 3:27}  Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel. And they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.
{2Ki 3:27}  便将那应当接续他作王的长子，在城上献为燔祭。以色列人遭遇耶和华的大怒（或作：招人痛恨），于是三王离开摩押王，各回本国去了。
{2Ki 4:1}   Now the wife of one of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD, but the creditor has come to take my two children to be his slaves."
{2Ki 4:1}   有一个先知门徒的妻哀求以利沙说：“你仆人我丈夫死了，他敬畏耶和华是你所知道的。现在有债主来，要取我两个儿子作奴仆。”
{2Ki 4:2}   And Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me; what have you in the house?" And she said, "Your servant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil."
{2Ki 4:2}   以利沙问他说：“我可以为你做什么呢？你告诉我，你家里有什么？”他说：“婢女家中除了一瓶油之外，没有什么。”
{2Ki 4:3}   Then he said, "Go outside, borrow vessels from all your neighbors, empty vessels and not too few.
{2Ki 4:3}   以利沙说：“你去，向你众邻舍借空器皿，不要少借；
{2Ki 4:4}   Then go in and shut the door behind yourself and your sons and pour into all these vessels. And when one is full, set it aside."
{2Ki 4:4}   回到家里，关上门，你和你儿子在里面将油倒在所有的器皿里，倒满了的放在一边。”
{2Ki 4:5}   So she went from him and shut the door behind herself and her sons. And as she poured they brought the vessels to her.
{2Ki 4:5}   于是，妇人离开以利沙去了，关上门，自己和儿子在里面；儿子把器皿拿来，他就倒油。
{2Ki 4:6}   When the vessels were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another vessel." And he said to her, "There is not another." Then the oil stopped flowing.
{2Ki 4:6}   器皿都满了，他对儿子说：“再给我拿器皿来。”儿子说：“再没有器皿了。”油就止住了。
{2Ki 4:7}   She came and told the man of God, and he said, "Go, sell the oil and pay your debts, and you and your sons can live on the rest."
{2Ki 4:7}   妇人去告诉神人，神人说：“你去卖油还债，所剩的你和你儿子可以靠着度日。”
{2Ki 4:8}   One day Elisha went on to Shunem, where a wealthy woman lived, who urged him to eat some food. So whenever he passed that way, he would turn in there to eat food.
{2Ki 4:8}   一日，以利沙走到书念，在那里有一个大户的妇人强留他吃饭。此后，以利沙每从那里经过就进去吃饭。
{2Ki 4:9}   And she said to her husband, "Behold now, I know that this is a holy man of God who is continually passing our way.
{2Ki 4:9}   妇人对丈夫说：“我看出那常从我们这里经过的是圣洁的神人。
{2Ki 4:10}  Let us make a small room on the roof with walls and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp, so that whenever he comes to us, he can go in there."
{2Ki 4:10}  我们可以为他在墙上盖一间小楼，在其中安放床榻、桌子、椅子、灯台，他来到我们这里，就可以住在其间。”
{2Ki 4:11}  One day he came there, and he turned into the chamber and rested there.
{2Ki 4:11}  一日，以利沙来到那里，就进了那楼躺卧。
{2Ki 4:12}  And he said to Gehazi his servant, "Call this Shunammite." When he had called her, she stood before him.
{2Ki 4:12}  以利沙吩咐仆人基哈西说：“你叫这书念妇人来。”他就把妇人叫了来，妇人站在以利沙面前。
{2Ki 4:13}  And he said to him, "Say now to her, 'See, you have taken all this trouble for us; what is to be done for you? Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?'" She answered, "I dwell among my own people."
{2Ki 4:13}  以利沙吩咐仆人说：“你对他说：你既为我们费了许多心思，可以为你做什么呢？你向王或元帅有所求的没有？”他回答说：“我在我本乡安居无事。”
{2Ki 4:14}  And he said, "What then is to be done for her?" Gehazi answered, "Well, she has no son, and her husband is old."
{2Ki 4:14}  以利沙对仆人说：“究竟当为他做什么呢？”基哈西说：“他没有儿子，他丈夫也老了。”
{2Ki 4:15}  He said, "Call her." And when he had called her, she stood in the doorway.
{2Ki 4:15}  以利沙说：“再叫他来。”于是叫了他来，他就站在门口。
{2Ki 4:16}  And he said, "At this season, about this time next year, you shall embrace a son." And she said, "No, my lord, O man of God; do not lie to your servant."
{2Ki 4:16}  以利沙说：“明年到这时候，你必抱一个儿子。”他说：“神人，我主啊，不要那样欺哄婢女。”
{2Ki 4:17}  But the woman conceived, and she bore a son about that time the following spring, as Elisha had said to her.
{2Ki 4:17}  妇人果然怀孕，到了那时候，生了一个儿子，正如以利沙所说的。
{2Ki 4:18}  When the child had grown, he went out one day to his father among the reapers.
{2Ki 4:18}  孩子渐渐长大，一日到他父亲和收割的人那里，
{2Ki 4:19}  And he said to his father, "Oh, my head, my head!" The father said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother."
{2Ki 4:19}  他对父亲说：“我的头啊，我的头啊！”他父亲对仆人说：“把他抱到他母亲那里。”
{2Ki 4:20}  And when he had lifted him and brought him to his mother, the child sat on her lap till noon, and then he died.
{2Ki 4:20}  仆人抱去，交给他母亲；孩子坐在母亲的膝上，到晌午就死了。
{2Ki 4:21}  And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God and shut the door behind him and went out.
{2Ki 4:21}  他母亲抱他上了楼，将他放在神人的床上，关上门出来，
{2Ki 4:22}  Then she called to her husband and said, "Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, that I may quickly go to the man of God and come back again."
{2Ki 4:22}  呼叫他丈夫说：“你叫一个仆人给我牵一匹驴来，我要快快地去见神人，就回来。”
{2Ki 4:23}  And he said, "Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath." She said, "All is well."
{2Ki 4:23}  丈夫说：“今日不是月朔，也不是安息日，你为何要去见他呢？”妇人说：“平安无事。”
{2Ki 4:24}  Then she saddled the donkey, and she said to her servant, "Urge the animal on; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you."
{2Ki 4:24}  于是备上驴，对仆人说：“你快快赶着走，我若不吩咐你，就不要迟慢。”
{2Ki 4:25}  So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her coming, he said to Gehazi his servant, "Look, there is the Shunammite.
{2Ki 4:25}  妇人就往迦密山去见神人。神人远远的看见他，对仆人基哈西说：“看哪，书念的妇人来了！
{2Ki 4:26}  Run at once to meet her and say to her, 'Is all well with you? Is all well with your husband? Is all well with the child?'" And she answered, "All is well."
{2Ki 4:26}  你跑去迎接他，问他说：你平安吗？你丈夫平安吗？孩子平安吗？”他说：“平安。”
{2Ki 4:27}  And when she came to the mountain to the man of God, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came to push her away. But the man of God said, "Leave her alone, for she is in bitter distress, and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me."
{2Ki 4:27}  妇人上了山，到神人那里，就抱住神人的脚。基哈西前来要推开他，神人说：“由他吧！因为他心里愁苦，耶和华向我隐瞒，没有指示我。”
{2Ki 4:28}  Then she said, "Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, 'Do not deceive me?'"
{2Ki 4:28}  妇人说：“我何尝向我主求过儿子呢？我岂没有说过，不要欺哄我吗？”
{2Ki 4:29}  He said to Gehazi, "Tie up your garment and take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not reply. And lay my staff on the face of the child."
{2Ki 4:29}  以利沙吩咐基哈西说：“你束上腰，手拿我的杖前去；若遇见人，不要向他问安；人若向你问安，也不要回答；要把我的杖放在孩子脸上。”
{2Ki 4:30}  Then the mother of the child said, "As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So he arose and followed her.
{2Ki 4:30}  孩子的母亲说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是以利沙起身，随着他去了。
{2Ki 4:31}  Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the face of the child, but there was no sound or sign of life. Therefore he returned to meet him and told him, "The child has not awakened."
{2Ki 4:31}  基哈西先去，把杖放在孩子脸上，却没有声音，也没有动静。基哈西就迎着以利沙回来，告诉他说：“孩子还没有醒过来。”
{2Ki 4:32}  When Elisha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on his bed.
{2Ki 4:32}  以利沙来到，进了屋子，看见孩子死了，放在自己的床上。
{2Ki 4:33}  So he went in and shut the door behind the two of them and prayed to the LORD.
{2Ki 4:33}  他就关上门，只有自己和孩子在里面，他便祈祷耶和华，
{2Ki 4:34}  Then he went up and lay on the child, putting his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. And as he stretched himself upon him, the flesh of the child became warm.
{2Ki 4:34}  上床伏在孩子身上，口对口，眼对眼，手对手；既伏在孩子身上，孩子的身体就渐渐温和了。
{2Ki 4:35}  Then he got up again and walked once back and forth in the house, and went up and stretched himself upon him. The child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
{2Ki 4:35}  然后他下来，在屋里来往走了一趟，又上去伏在孩子身上，孩子打了七个喷嚏，就睁开眼睛了。
{2Ki 4:36}  Then he summoned Gehazi and said, "Call this Shunammite." So he called her. And when she came to him, he said, "Pick up your son."
{2Ki 4:36}  以利沙叫基哈西说：“你叫这书念妇人来”；于是叫了他来。以利沙说：“将你儿子抱起来。”
{2Ki 4:37}  She came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out.
{2Ki 4:37}  妇人就进来，在以利沙脚前俯伏于地，抱起他儿子出去了。
{2Ki 4:38}  And Elisha came again to Gilgal when there was a famine in the land. And as the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he said to his servant, "Set on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets."
{2Ki 4:38}  以利沙又来到吉甲，那地正有饥荒。先知门徒坐在他面前，他吩咐仆人说：“你将大锅放在火上，给先知门徒熬汤。”
{2Ki 4:39}  One of them went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew, not knowing what they were.
{2Ki 4:39}  有一个人去到田野掐菜，遇见一棵野瓜藤，就摘了一兜野瓜回来，切了搁在熬汤的锅中，因为他们不知道是什么东西；
{2Ki 4:40}  And they poured out some for the men to eat. But while they were eating of the stew, they cried out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" And they could not eat it.
{2Ki 4:40}  倒出来给众人吃，吃的时候，都喊叫说：“神人哪，锅中有致死的毒物！”所以众人不能吃了。
{2Ki 4:41}  He said, "Then bring flour." And he threw it into the pot and said, "Pour some out for the men, that they may eat." And there was no harm in the pot.
{2Ki 4:41}  以利沙说：“拿点面来”，就把面撒在锅中，说：“倒出来，给众人吃吧！”锅中就没有毒了。
{2Ki 4:42}  A man came from Baal-shalishah, bringing the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And Elisha said, "Give to the men, that they may eat."
{2Ki 4:42}  有一个人从巴力沙利沙来，带着初熟大麦做的饼二十个，并新穗子，装在口袋里送给神人。神人说：“把这些给众人吃。”
{2Ki 4:43}  But his servant said, "How can I set this before a hundred men?" So he repeated, "Give them to the men, that they may eat, for thus says the LORD, 'They shall eat and have some left.'"
{2Ki 4:43}  仆人说：“这一点岂可摆给一百人吃呢？”以利沙说：“你只管给众人吃吧！因为耶和华如此说，众人必吃了，还剩下。”
{2Ki 4:44}  So he set it before them. And they ate and had some left, according to the word of the LORD.
{2Ki 4:44}  仆人就摆在众人面前，他们吃了，果然还剩下，正如耶和华所说的。
{2Ki 5:1}   Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and in high favor, because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria. He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.
{2Ki 5:1}   亚兰王的元帅乃缦在他主人面前为尊为大，因耶和华曾藉他使亚兰人得胜；他又是大能的勇士，只是长了大麻疯。
{2Ki 5:2}   Now the Syrians on one of their raids had carried off a little girl from the land of Israel, and she worked in the service of Naaman's wife.
{2Ki 5:2}   先前亚兰人成群地出去，从以色列国掳了一个小女子，这女子就服事乃缦的妻。
{2Ki 5:3}   She said to her mistress, "Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy."
{2Ki 5:3}   他对主母说：“巴不得我主人去见撒玛利亚的先知，必能治好他的大麻疯。”
{2Ki 5:4}   So Naaman went in and told his lord, "Thus and so spoke the girl from the land of Israel."
{2Ki 5:4}   乃缦进去，告诉他主人说，以色列国的女子如此如此说。
{2Ki 5:5}   And the king of Syria said, "Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So he went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothing.
{2Ki 5:5}   亚兰王说：“你可以去，我也达信于以色列王。”于是乃缦带银子十他连得，金子六千舍客勒，衣裳十套，就去了；
{2Ki 5:6}   And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, "When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you Naaman my servant, that you may cure him of his leprosy."
{2Ki 5:6}   且带信给以色列王，信上说：“我打发臣仆乃缦去见你，你接到这信，就要治好他的大麻疯。”
{2Ki 5:7}   And when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, "Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Only consider, and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me."
{2Ki 5:7}   以色列王看了信就撕裂衣服，说：“我岂是神，能使人死使人活呢？这人竟打发人来，叫我治好他的大麻疯。你们看一看，这人何以寻隙攻击我呢？”
{2Ki 5:8}   But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, "Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel."
{2Ki 5:8}   神人以利沙听见以色列王撕裂衣服，就打发人去见王，说：“你为什么撕了衣服呢？可使那人到我这里来，他就知道以色列中有先知了。”
{2Ki 5:9}   So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha's house.
{2Ki 5:9}   于是，乃缦带着车马到了以利沙的家，站在门前。
{2Ki 5:10}  And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean."
{2Ki 5:10}  以利沙打发一个使者，对乃缦说：“你去在约但河中沐浴七回，你的肉就必复原，而得洁净。”
{2Ki 5:11}  But Naaman was angry and went away, saying, "Behold, I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call upon the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper.
{2Ki 5:11}  乃缦却发怒走了，说：“我想他必定出来见我，站着求告耶和华他神的名，在患处以上摇手，治好这大麻疯。
{2Ki 5:12}  Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage.
{2Ki 5:12}  大马色的河亚罢拿和法珥法岂不比以色列的一切水更好吗？我在那里沐浴不得洁净吗？”于是气忿忿地转身去了。
{2Ki 5:13}  But his servants came near and said to him, "My father, it is a great word the prophet has spoken to you; will you not do it? Has he actually said to you, 'Wash, and be clean'?"
{2Ki 5:13}  他的仆人进前来，对他说：“我父啊，先知若吩咐你做一件大事，你岂不做吗？何况说你去沐浴而得洁净呢？”
{2Ki 5:14}  So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
{2Ki 5:14}  于是乃缦下去，照着神人的话，在约但河里沐浴七回；他的肉复原，好像小孩子的肉，他就洁净了。
{2Ki 5:15}  Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and he came and stood before him. And he said, "Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; so accept now a present from your servant."
{2Ki 5:15}  乃缦带着一切跟随他的人，回到神人那里，站在他面前，说：“如今我知道，除了以色列之外，普天下没有神。现在求你收点仆人的礼物。”
{2Ki 5:16}  But he said, "As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none." And he urged him to take it, but he refused.
{2Ki 5:16}  以利沙说：“我指着所事奉永生的耶和华起誓，我必不受。”乃缦再三的求他，他却不受。
{2Ki 5:17}  Then Naaman said, "If not, please let there be given to your servant two mule loads of earth, for from now on your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the LORD.
{2Ki 5:17}  乃缦说：“你若不肯受，请将两骡子驮的土赐给仆人。从今以后，仆人必不再将燔祭或平安祭献与别神，只献给耶和华。
{2Ki 5:18}  In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, leaning on my arm, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this matter."
{2Ki 5:18}  惟有一件事，愿耶和华饶恕你仆人：我主人进临门庙叩拜的时候，我用手搀他在临门庙，我也屈身。我在临门庙屈身的这事，愿耶和华饶恕我。”
{2Ki 5:19}  He said to him, "Go in peace." But when Naaman had gone from him a short distance,
{2Ki 5:19}  以利沙对他说：“你可以平平安安的回去！”乃缦就离开他去了；走了不远，
{2Ki 5:20}  Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, "See, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not accepting from his hand what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him."
{2Ki 5:20}  神人以利沙的仆人基哈西心里说：“我主人不愿从这亚兰人乃缦手里受他带来的礼物，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，我必跑去追上他，向他要些。”
{2Ki 5:21}  So Gehazi followed Naaman. And when Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and said, "Is all well?"
{2Ki 5:21}  于是基哈西追赶乃缦。乃缦看见有人追赶，就急忙下车迎着他，说：“都平安吗？”
{2Ki 5:22}  And he said, "All is well. My master has sent me to say, 'There have just now come to me from the hill country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.'"
{2Ki 5:22}  说：“都平安。我主人打发我来说：‘刚才有两个少年人，是先知门徒，从以法莲山地来见我，请你赐他们一他连得银子，两套衣裳。’”
{2Ki 5:23}  And Naaman said, "Be pleased to accept two talents." And he urged him and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants. And they carried them before Gehazi.
{2Ki 5:23}  乃缦说：“请受二他连得”；再三的请受，便将二他连得银子装在两个口袋里，又将两套衣裳交给两个仆人；他们就在基哈西前头抬着走。
{2Ki 5:24}  And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and put them in the house, and he sent the men away, and they departed.
{2Ki 5:24}  到了山冈，基哈西从他们手中接过来，放在屋里，打发他们回去。
{2Ki 5:25}  He went in and stood before his master, and Elisha said to him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" And he said, "Your servant went nowhere."
{2Ki 5:25}  基哈西进去，站在他主人面前。以利沙问他说：“基哈西你从那里来？”回答说：“仆人没有往那里去。”
{2Ki 5:26}  But he said to him, "Did not my heart go when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Was it a time to accept money and garments, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male servants and female servants?
{2Ki 5:26}  以利沙对他说：“那人下车转回迎你的时候，我的心岂没有去呢？这岂是受银子、衣裳、买橄榄园、葡萄园、牛羊、仆婢的时候呢？
{2Ki 5:27}  Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever." So he went out from his presence a leper, like snow.
{2Ki 5:27}  因此，乃缦的大麻疯必沾染你和你的后裔，直到永远。”基哈西从以利沙面前退出去，就长了大麻疯，像雪那样白。
{2Ki 6:1}   Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "See, the place where we dwell under your charge is too small for us.
{2Ki 6:1}   先知门徒对以利沙说：“看哪，我们同你所住的地方过于窄小，
{2Ki 6:2}   Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get there a log, and let us make a place for us to dwell there." And he answered, "Go."
{2Ki 6:2}   求你容我们往约但河去，各人从那里取一根木料建造房屋居住。”他说：“你们去吧！”
{2Ki 6:3}   Then one of them said, "Be pleased to go with your servants." And he answered, "I will go."
{2Ki 6:3}   有一人说：“求你与仆人同去。”回答说：“我可以去。”
{2Ki 6:4}   So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.
{2Ki 6:4}   于是以利沙与他们同去。到了约但河，就砍伐树木。
{2Ki 6:5}   But as one was felling a log, his axe head fell into the water, and he cried out, "Alas, my master! It was borrowed."
{2Ki 6:5}   有一人砍树的时候，斧头掉在水里，他就呼叫说：“哀哉！我主啊，这斧子是借的。”
{2Ki 6:6}   Then the man of God said, "Where did it fall?" When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float.
{2Ki 6:6}   神人问说：“掉在那里了？”他将那地方指给以利沙看。以利沙砍了一根木头，抛在水里，斧头就漂上来了。
{2Ki 6:7}   And he said, "Take it up." So he reached out his hand and took it.
{2Ki 6:7}   以利沙说：“拿起来吧！”那人就伸手拿起来了。
{2Ki 6:8}   Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servants, saying, "At such and such a place shall be my camp."
{2Ki 6:8}   亚兰王与以色列人争战，和他的臣仆商议说：“我要在某处某处安营。”
{2Ki 6:9}   But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, "Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are going down there."
{2Ki 6:9}   神人打发人去见以色列王，说：“你要谨慎，不要从某处经过，因为亚兰人从那里下来了。”
{2Ki 6:10}  And the king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God told him. Thus he used to warn him, so that he saved himself there more than once or twice.
{2Ki 6:10}  以色列王差人去窥探神人所告诉所警戒他去的地方，就防备未受其害，不止一两次。
{2Ki 6:11}  And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing, and he called his servants and said to them, "Will you not show me who of us is for the king of Israel?"
{2Ki 6:11}  亚兰王因这事心里惊疑，召了臣仆来，对他们说：“我们这里有谁帮助以色列王，你们不指给我吗？”
{2Ki 6:12}  And one of his servants said, "None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom."
{2Ki 6:12}  有一个臣仆说：“我主，我王！无人帮助他，只有以色列中的先知以利沙，将王在卧房所说的话告诉以色列王了。”
{2Ki 6:13}  And he said, "Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him." It was told him, "Behold, he is in Dothan."
{2Ki 6:13}  王说：“你们去探他在那里，我好打发人去捉拿他。”有人告诉王说：“他在多坍。”
{2Ki 6:14}  So he sent there horses and chariots and a great army, and they came by night and surrounded the city.
{2Ki 6:14}  王就打发车马和大军往那里去，夜间到了，围困那城。
{2Ki 6:15}  When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. And the servant said, "Alas, my master! What shall we do?"
{2Ki 6:15}  神人的仆人清早起来出去，看见车马军兵围困了城。仆人对神人说：“哀哉！我主啊，我们怎样行才好呢？”
{2Ki 6:16}  He said, "Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them."
{2Ki 6:16}  神人说：“不要惧怕！与我们同在的比与他们同在的更多。”
{2Ki 6:17}  Then Elisha prayed and said, "O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see." So the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
{2Ki 6:17}  以利沙祷告说：“耶和华啊，求你开这少年人的眼目，使他能看见。”耶和华开他的眼目，他就看见满山有火车火马围绕以利沙。
{2Ki 6:18}  And when the Syrians came down against him, Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, "Please strike this people with blindness." So he struck them with blindness in accordance with the prayer of Elisha.
{2Ki 6:18}  敌人下到以利沙那里，以利沙祷告耶和华说：“求你使这些人的眼目昏迷。”耶和华就照以利沙的话，使他们的眼目昏迷。
{2Ki 6:19}  And Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek." And he led them to Samaria.
{2Ki 6:19}  以利沙对他们说：“这不是那道，也不是那城；你们跟我去，我必领你们到所寻找的人那里。”于是领他们到了撒玛利亚。
{2Ki 6:20}  As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, "O LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see." So the LORD opened their eyes and they saw, and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
{2Ki 6:20}  他们进了撒玛利亚，以利沙祷告说：“耶和华啊，求你开这些人的眼目，使他们能看见。”耶和华开他们的眼目，他们就看见了，不料，是在撒玛利亚的城中。
{2Ki 6:21}  As soon as the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, "My father, shall I strike them down? Shall I strike them down?"
{2Ki 6:21}  以色列王见了他们，就问以利沙说：“我父啊，我可以击杀他们吗？”
{2Ki 6:22}  He answered, "You shall not strike them down. Would you strike down those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master."
{2Ki 6:22}  回答说：“不可击杀他们！就是你用刀用弓掳来的，岂可击杀他们吗（或作：也不可击杀，何况这些人呢）？当在他们面前设摆饮食，使他们吃喝回到他们的主人那里。”
{2Ki 6:23}  So he prepared for them a great feast, and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the Syrians did not come again on raids into the land of Israel.
{2Ki 6:23}  王就为他们预备了许多食物；他们吃喝完了，打发他们回到他们主人那里。从此，亚兰军不再犯以色列境了。
{2Ki 6:24}  Afterward Ben-hadad king of Syria mustered his entire army and went up and besieged Samaria.
{2Ki 6:24}  此后，亚兰王便哈达聚集他的全军，上来围困撒玛利亚。
{2Ki 6:25}  And there was a great famine in Samaria, as they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver.
{2Ki 6:25}  于是撒玛利亚被围困，有饥荒，甚至一个驴头值银八十舍客勒，二升鸽子粪值银五舍客勒。
{2Ki 6:26}  Now as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, "Help, my lord, O king!"
{2Ki 6:26}  一日，以色列王在城上经过，有一个妇人向他呼叫说：“我主，我王啊！求你帮助。”
{2Ki 6:27}  And he said, "If the LORD will not help you, how shall I help you? From the threshing floor, or from the winepress?"
{2Ki 6:27}  王说：“耶和华不帮助你，我从何处帮助你？是从禾场，是从酒榨呢？”
{2Ki 6:28}  And the king asked her, "What is your trouble?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'
{2Ki 6:28}  王问妇人说：“你有什么苦处？”他回答说：“这妇人对我说：‘将你的儿子取来，我们今日可以吃，明日可以吃我的儿子。’
{2Ki 6:29}  So we boiled my son and ate him. And on the next day I said to her, 'Give your son, that we may eat him.' But she has hidden her son."
{2Ki 6:29}  我们就煮了我的儿子吃了。次日我对他说：‘要将你的儿子取来，我们可以吃。’他却将他的儿子藏起来了。”
{2Ki 6:30}  When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes--now he was passing by on the wall--and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath on his body--
{2Ki 6:30}  王听见妇人的话，就撕裂衣服；（王在城上经过）百姓看见王贴身穿着麻衣。
{2Ki 6:31}  and he said, "May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today."
{2Ki 6:31}  王说：“我今日若容沙法的儿子以利沙的头仍在他项上，愿神重重的降罚与我！”
{2Ki 6:32}  Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Now the king had dispatched a man from his presence, but before the messenger arrived Elisha said to the elders, "Do you see how this murderer has sent to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door fast against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"
{2Ki 6:32}  那时，以利沙正坐在家中，长老也与他同坐。王打发一个伺候他的人去；他还没有到，以利沙对长老说：“你们看这凶手之子，打发人来斩我的头；你们看着使者来到，就关上门，用门将他推出去。在他后头不是有他主人脚步的响声吗？”
{2Ki 6:33}  And while he was still speaking with them, the messenger came down to him and said, "This trouble is from the LORD! Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?"
{2Ki 6:33}  正说话的时候，使者来到，王也到了，说：“这灾祸是从耶和华那里来的，我何必再仰望耶和华呢？”
{2Ki 7:1}   But Elisha said, "Hear the word of the LORD: thus says the LORD, Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria."
{2Ki 7:1}   以利沙说：“你们要听耶和华的话，耶和华如此说：明日约到这时候，在撒玛利亚城门口，一细亚细面要卖银一舍客勒，二细亚大麦也要卖银一舍客勒。”
{2Ki 7:2}   Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned said to the man of God, "If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?" But he said, "You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it."
{2Ki 7:2}   有一个搀扶王的军长对神人说：“即便耶和华使天开了窗户，也不能有这事。”以利沙说：“你必亲眼看见，却不得吃。”
{2Ki 7:3}   Now there were four men who were lepers at the entrance to the gate. And they said to one another, "Why are we sitting here until we die?
{2Ki 7:3}   在城门那里有四个长大麻疯的人，他们彼此说：“我们为何坐在这里等死呢？
{2Ki 7:4}   If we say, 'Let us enter the city,' the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we die also. So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare our lives we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but die."
{2Ki 7:4}   我们若说，进城去吧！城里有饥荒，必死在那里；若在这里坐着不动，也必是死。来吧，我们去投降亚兰人的军队，他们若留我们的活命，就活着；若杀我们，就死了吧！”
{2Ki 7:5}   So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. But when they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no one there.
{2Ki 7:5}   黄昏的时候，他们起来往亚兰人的营盘去；到了营边，不见一人在那里。
{2Ki 7:6}   For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians hear the sound of chariots and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, "Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us."
{2Ki 7:6}   因为主使亚兰人的军队听见车马的声音，是大军的声音；他们就彼此说：“这必是以色列王贿买赫人的诸王和埃及人的诸王来攻击我们。”
{2Ki 7:7}   So they fled away in the twilight and abandoned their tents, their horses, and their donkeys, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their lives.
{2Ki 7:7}   所以，在黄昏的时候他们起来逃跑，撇下帐棚、马、驴，营盘照旧，只顾逃命。
{2Ki 7:8}   And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent and ate and drank, and they carried off silver and gold and clothing and went and hid them. Then they came back and entered another tent and carried off things from it and went and hid them.
{2Ki 7:8}   那些长大麻疯的到了营边，进了帐棚，吃了喝了，且从其中拿出金银和衣服来，去收藏了；回来又进了一座帐棚，从其中拿出财物来去收藏了。
{2Ki 7:9}   Then they said to one another, "We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news. If we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come; let us go and tell the king's household."
{2Ki 7:9}   那时，他们彼此说：“我们所做的不好！今日是有好信息的日子，我们竟不作声！若等到天亮，罪必临到我们。来吧，我们与王家报信去！”
{2Ki 7:10}  So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, "We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied and the donkeys tied and the tents as they were."
{2Ki 7:10}  他们就去叫守城门的，告诉他们说：“我们到了亚兰人的营，不见一人在那里，也无人声，只有拴着的马和驴，帐棚都照旧。”
{2Ki 7:11}  Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king's household.
{2Ki 7:11}  守城门的叫了众守门的人来，他们就进去与王家报信。
{2Ki 7:12}  And the king rose in the night and said to his servants, "I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive and get into the city.'"
{2Ki 7:12}  王夜间起来，对臣仆说：“我告诉你们亚兰人向我们如何行。他们知道我们饥饿，所以离营，埋伏在田野，说：‘以色列人出城的时候，我们就活捉他们，得以进城。’”
{2Ki 7:13}  And one of his servants said, "Let some men take five of the remaining horses, seeing that those who are left here will fare like the whole multitude of Israel who have already perished. Let us send and see."
{2Ki 7:13}  有一个臣仆对王说：“我们不如用城里剩下之马中的五匹马（马和城里剩下的以色列人都是一样，快要灭绝），打发人去窥探。”
{2Ki 7:14}  So they took two horsemen, and the king sent them after the army of the Syrians, saying, "Go and see."
{2Ki 7:14}  于是取了两辆车和马，王差人去追寻亚兰军，说：“你们去窥探窥探。”
{2Ki 7:15}  So they went after them as far as the Jordan, and behold, all the way was littered with garments and equipment that the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king.
{2Ki 7:15}  他们就追寻到约但河，看见满道上都是亚兰人急跑时丢弃的衣服器具，使者就回来报告王。
{2Ki 7:16}  Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
{2Ki 7:16}  众人就出去，掳掠亚兰人的营盘。于是一细亚细面卖银一舍客勒，二细亚大麦也卖银一舍客勒，正如耶和华所说的。
{2Ki 7:17}  Now the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. And the people trampled him in the gate, so that he died, as the man of God had said when the king came down to him.
{2Ki 7:17}  王派搀扶他的那军长在城门口弹压，众人在那里将他践踏，他就死了，正如神人在王下来见他的时候所说的。
{2Ki 7:18}  For when the man of God had said to the king, "Two seahs of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria,"
{2Ki 7:18}  神人曾对王说：“明日约到这时候，在撒玛利亚城门口，二细亚大麦要卖银一舍客勒，一细亚细面也要卖银一舍客勒。”
{2Ki 7:19}  the captain had answered the man of God, "If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?" And he had said, "You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it."
{2Ki 7:19}  那军长对神人说：“即便耶和华使天开了窗户，也不能有这事。”神人说：“你必亲眼看见，却不得吃。”
{2Ki 7:20}  And so it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate and he died.
{2Ki 7:20}  这话果然应验在他身上；因为众人在城门口将他践踏，他就死了。
{2Ki 8:1}   Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, "Arise, and depart with your household, and sojourn wherever you can, for the LORD has called for a famine, and it will come upon the land for seven years."
{2Ki 8:1}   以利沙曾对所救活之子的那妇人说：“你和你的全家要起身往你可住的地方去住，因为耶和华命饥荒降在这地七年。”
{2Ki 8:2}   So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God. She went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
{2Ki 8:2}   妇人就起身，照神人的话带着全家往非利士地去，住了七年。
{2Ki 8:3}   And at the end of the seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to appeal to the king for her house and her land.
{2Ki 8:3}   七年完了，那妇人从非利士地回来，就出去为自己的房屋田地哀告王。
{2Ki 8:4}   Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, "Tell me all the great things that Elisha has done."
{2Ki 8:4}   那时王正与神人的仆人基哈西说：“请你将以利沙所行的一切大事告诉我。”
{2Ki 8:5}   And while he was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, "My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Elisha restored to life."
{2Ki 8:5}   基哈西告诉王以利沙如何使死人复活，恰巧以利沙所救活、他儿子的那妇人为自己的房屋田地来哀告王。基哈西说：“我主我王，这就是那妇人，这是他的儿子，就是以利沙所救活的。”
{2Ki 8:6}   And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an official for her, saying, "Restore all that was hers, together with all the produce of the fields from the day that she left the land until now."
{2Ki 8:6}   王问那妇人，他就把那事告诉王。于是王为他派一个太监，说：“凡属这妇人的都还给他，自从他离开本地直到今日，他田地的出产也都还给他。”
{2Ki 8:7}   Now Elisha came to Damascus. Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick. And when it was told him, "The man of God has come here,"
{2Ki 8:7}   以利沙来到大马色，亚兰王便哈达正患病。有人告诉王说：“神人来到这里了。”
{2Ki 8:8}   the king said to Hazael, "Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD through him, saying, 'Shall I recover from this sickness?'"
{2Ki 8:8}   王就吩咐哈薛说：“你带着礼物去见神人，托他求问耶和华，我这病能好不能好？”
{2Ki 8:9}   So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camels' loads. When he came and stood before him, he said, "Your son Ben-hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, 'Shall I recover from this sickness?'"
{2Ki 8:9}   于是哈薛用四十个骆驼，驮着大马色的各样美物为礼物，去见以利沙。到了他那里，站在他面前，说：“你儿子亚兰王便哈达打发我来见你，他问说：‘我这病能好不能好？’”
{2Ki 8:10}  And Elisha said to him, "Go, say to him, 'You shall certainly recover,' but the LORD has shown me that he shall certainly die."
{2Ki 8:10}  以利沙对哈薛说：“你回去告诉他说，这病必能好；但耶和华指示我，他必要死。”
{2Ki 8:11}  And he fixed his gaze and stared at him, until he was embarrassed. And the man of God wept.
{2Ki 8:11}  神人定睛看着哈薛，甚至他惭愧。神人就哭了；
{2Ki 8:12}  And Hazael said, "Why does my lord weep?" He answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel. You will set on fire their fortresses, and you will kill their young men with the sword and dash in pieces their little ones and rip open their pregnant women."
{2Ki 8:12}  哈薛说：“我主为什么哭？”回答说：“因为我知道你必苦害以色列人，用火焚烧他们的保障，用刀杀死他们的壮丁，摔死他们的婴孩，剖开他们的孕妇。”
{2Ki 8:13}  And Hazael said, "What is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?" Elisha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you are to be king over Syria."
{2Ki 8:13}  哈薛说：“你仆人算什么，不过是一条狗，焉能行这大事呢？”以利沙回答说：“耶和华指示我，你必作亚兰王。”
{2Ki 8:14}  Then he departed from Elisha and came to his master, who said to him, "What did Elisha say to you?" And he answered, "He told me that you would certainly recover."
{2Ki 8:14}  哈薛离开以利沙，回去见他的主人。主人问他说：“以利沙对你说什么？”回答说：“他告诉我你必能好。”
{2Ki 8:15}  But the next day he took the bed cloth and dipped it in water and spread it over his face, till he died. And Hazael became king in his place.
{2Ki 8:15}  次日，哈薛拿被窝浸在水中，蒙住王的脸，王就死了。于是哈薛篡了他的位。
{2Ki 8:16}  In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, began to reign.
{2Ki 8:16}  以色列王亚哈的儿子约兰第五年，犹大王约沙法还在位的时候，约沙法的儿子约兰登基作了犹大王。
{2Ki 8:17}  He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
{2Ki 8:17}  约兰登基的时候年三十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王八年。
{2Ki 8:18}  And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
{2Ki 8:18}  他行以色列诸王所行的，与亚哈家一样；因为他娶了亚哈的女儿为妻，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。
{2Ki 8:19}  Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, since he promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.
{2Ki 8:19}  耶和华却因他仆人大卫的缘故，仍不肯灭绝犹大，照他所应许大卫的话，永远赐灯光与他的子孙。
{2Ki 8:20}  In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah and set up a king of their own.
{2Ki 8:20}  约兰年间，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，自己立王。
{2Ki 8:21}  Then Joram passed over to Zair with all his chariots and rose by night, and he and his chariot commanders struck the Edomites who had surrounded him, but his army fled home.
{2Ki 8:21}  约兰率领所有的战车往撒益去，夜间起来，攻打围困他的以东人和车兵长；犹大兵就逃跑，各回各家去了。
{2Ki 8:22}  So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
{2Ki 8:22}  这样，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，直到今日。那时立拿人也背叛了。
{2Ki 8:23}  Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 8:23}  约兰其余的事，凡他所行的，都写在犹大列王记上。
{2Ki 8:24}  So Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 8:24}  约兰与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子亚哈谢接续他作王。
{2Ki 8:25}  In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.
{2Ki 8:25}  以色列王亚哈的儿子约兰十二年，犹大王约兰的儿子亚哈谢登基。
{2Ki 8:26}  Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah; she was a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
{2Ki 8:26}  他登基的时候年二十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王一年。他母亲名叫亚他利雅，是以色列王暗利的孙女。
{2Ki 8:27}  He also walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was son-in-law to the house of Ahab.
{2Ki 8:27}  亚哈谢效法亚哈家行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，与亚哈家一样，因为他是亚哈家的女婿。
{2Ki 8:28}  He went with Joram the son of Ahab to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram.
{2Ki 8:28}  他与亚哈的儿子约兰同往基列的拉末去，与亚兰王哈薛争战。亚兰人打伤了约兰，
{2Ki 8:29}  And King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
{2Ki 8:29}  约兰王回到耶斯列，医治在拉末与亚兰王哈薛打仗的时候所受的伤。犹大王约兰的儿子亚哈谢因为亚哈的儿子约兰病了，就下到耶斯列看望他。
{2Ki 9:1}   Then Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, "Tie up your garments, and take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
{2Ki 9:1}   先知以利沙叫了一个先知门徒来，吩咐他说：“你束上腰，手拿这瓶膏油往基列的拉末去。
{2Ki 9:2}   And when you arrive, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi. And go in and have him rise from among his fellows, and lead him to an inner chamber.
{2Ki 9:2}   到了那里，要寻找宁示的孙子、约沙法的儿子耶户，使他从同僚中起来，带他进严密的屋子，
{2Ki 9:3}   Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, 'Thus says the LORD, I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the door and flee; do not linger."
{2Ki 9:3}   将瓶里的膏油倒在他头上，说：‘耶和华如此说：我膏你作以色列王。’说完了，就开门逃跑，不要迟延。”
{2Ki 9:4}   So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
{2Ki 9:4}   于是那少年先知往基列的拉末去了。
{2Ki 9:5}   And when he came, behold, the commanders of the army were in council. And he said, "I have a word for you, O commander." And Jehu said, "To which of us all?" And he said, "To you, O commander."
{2Ki 9:5}   到了那里，看见众军长都坐着，就说：“将军哪，我有话对你说。”耶户说：“我们众人里，你要对那一个说呢？”回答说：“将军哪，我要对你说。”
{2Ki 9:6}   So he arose and went into the house. And the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.
{2Ki 9:6}   耶户就起来，进了屋子，少年人将膏油倒在他头上，对他说：“耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘我膏你作耶和华民以色列的王。
{2Ki 9:7}   And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge on Jezebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD.
{2Ki 9:7}   你要击杀你主人亚哈的全家，我好在耶洗别身上伸我仆人众先知和耶和华一切仆人流血的冤。
{2Ki 9:8}   For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.
{2Ki 9:8}   亚哈全家必都灭亡，凡属亚哈的男丁，无论是困住的、自由的，我必从以色列中剪除，
{2Ki 9:9}   And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.
{2Ki 9:9}   使亚哈的家像尼八儿子耶罗波安的家，又像亚希雅儿子巴沙的家。
{2Ki 9:10}  And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury her." Then he opened the door and fled.
{2Ki 9:10}  耶洗别必在耶斯列田里被狗所吃，无人葬埋。’”说完了，少年人就开门逃跑了。
{2Ki 9:11}  When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they said to him, "Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?" And he said to them, "You know the fellow and his talk."
{2Ki 9:11}  耶户出来，回到他主人的臣仆那里，有一人问他说：“平安吗？这狂妄的人来见你有什么事呢？”回答说：“你们认得那人，也知道他说什么。”
{2Ki 9:12}  And they said, "That is not true; tell us now." And he said, "Thus and so he spoke to me, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, I anoint you king over Israel.'"
{2Ki 9:12}  他们说：“这是假话，你据实地告诉我们。”回答说：“他如此如此对我说。他说：‘耶和华如此说：我膏你作以色列王。’”
{2Ki 9:13}  Then in haste every man of them took his garment and put it under him on the bare steps, and they blew the trumpet and proclaimed, "Jehu is king."
{2Ki 9:13}  他们就急忙各将自己的衣服铺在上层台阶，使耶户坐在其上；他们吹角，说：“耶户作王了！”
{2Ki 9:14}  Thus Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Syria,
{2Ki 9:14}  这样，宁示的孙子、约沙法的儿子耶户背叛约兰。先是约兰和以色列众人因为亚兰王哈薛的缘故，把守基列的拉末；
{2Ki 9:15}  but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) So Jehu said, "If this is your decision, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel."
{2Ki 9:15}  但约兰王回到耶斯列，医治与亚兰王哈薛打仗所受的伤。耶户说：“若合你们的意思，就不容人逃出城往耶斯列报信去。”
{2Ki 9:16}  Then Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to visit Joram.
{2Ki 9:16}  于是耶户坐车往耶斯列去，因为约兰病卧在那里。犹大王亚哈谢已经下去看望他。
{2Ki 9:17}  Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came and said, "I see a company." And Joram said, "Take a horseman and send to meet them, and let him say, 'Is it peace?'"
{2Ki 9:17}  有一个守望的人站在耶斯列的楼上，看见耶户带着一群人来，就说：“我看见一群人。”约兰说：“打发一个骑马的去迎接他们，问说：平安不平安？”
{2Ki 9:18}  So a man on horseback went to meet him and said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" And Jehu said, "What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and ride behind me." And the watchman reported, saying, "The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back."
{2Ki 9:18}  骑马的就去迎接耶户，说：“王问说，平安不平安？”耶户说：“平安不平安与你何干？你转在我后头吧！”守望的人又说：“使者到了他们那里，却不回来。”
{2Ki 9:19}  Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, "Thus the king has said, 'Is it peace?'" And Jehu answered, "What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and ride behind me."
{2Ki 9:19}  王又打发一个骑马的去。这人到了他们那里，说：“王问说，平安不平安？”耶户说：“平安不平安与你何干？你转在我后头吧！”
{2Ki 9:20}  Again the watchman reported, "He reached them, but he is not coming back. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously."
{2Ki 9:20}  守望的人又说：“他到了他们那里，也不回来；车赶得甚猛，像宁示的孙子耶户的赶法。”
{2Ki 9:21}  Joram said, "Make ready." And they made ready his chariot. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out, each in his chariot, and went to meet Jehu, and met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
{2Ki 9:21}  约兰吩咐说：“套车！”人就给他套车。以色列王约兰和犹大王亚哈谢各坐自己的车出去迎接耶户，在耶斯列人拿伯的田那里遇见他。
{2Ki 9:22}  And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Is it peace, Jehu?" He answered, "What peace can there be, so long as the whorings and the sorceries of your mother Jezebel are so many?"
{2Ki 9:22}  约兰见耶户就说：“耶户啊，平安吗？”耶户说：“你母亲耶洗别的淫行邪术这样多，焉能平安呢？”
{2Ki 9:23}  Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahaziah, "Treachery, O Ahaziah!"
{2Ki 9:23}  约兰就转车逃跑，对亚哈谢说：“亚哈谢啊，反了！”
{2Ki 9:24}  And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart, and he sank in his chariot.
{2Ki 9:24}  耶户开满了弓，射中约兰的脊背，箭从心窝穿出，约兰就仆倒在车上。
{2Ki 9:25}  Jehu said to Bidkar his aide, "Take him up and throw him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. For remember, when you and I rode side by side behind Ahab his father, how the LORD made this pronouncement against him:
{2Ki 9:25}  耶户对他的军长毕甲说：“你把他抛在耶斯列人拿伯的田间。你当追想，你我一同坐车跟随他父亚哈的时候，耶和华对亚哈所说的预言，
{2Ki 9:26}  'As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons--declares the LORD--I will repay you on this plot of ground.' Now therefore take him up and throw him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the LORD."
{2Ki 9:26}  说：‘我昨日看见拿伯的血和他众子的血，我必在这块田上报应你。’这是耶和华说的，现在你要照着耶和华的话，把他抛在这田间。”
{2Ki 9:27}  When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him and said, "Shoot him also." And they shot him in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo and died there.
{2Ki 9:27}  犹大王亚哈谢见这光景，就从园亭之路逃跑。耶户追赶他，说：“把这人也杀在车上。”到了靠近以伯莲的姑珥坡上击伤了他。他逃到米吉多，就死在那里。
{2Ki 9:28}  His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.
{2Ki 9:28}  他的臣仆用车将他的尸首送到耶路撒冷，葬在大卫城他自己的坟墓里，与他列祖同葬。
{2Ki 9:29}  In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.
{2Ki 9:29}  亚哈谢登基作犹大王的时候，是在亚哈的儿子约兰第十一年。
{2Ki 9:30}  When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it. And she painted her eyes and adorned her head and looked out of the window.
{2Ki 9:30}  耶户到了耶斯列；耶洗别听见就擦粉、梳头，从窗户里往外观看。
{2Ki 9:31}  And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, "Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?"
{2Ki 9:31}  耶户进门的时候，耶洗别说：“杀主人的心利啊，平安吗？”
{2Ki 9:32}  And he lifted up his face to the window and said, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
{2Ki 9:32}  耶户抬头向窗户观看，说：“谁顺从我？”有两三个太监从窗户往外看他。
{2Ki 9:33}  He said, "Throw her down." So they threw her down. And some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled on her.
{2Ki 9:33}  耶户说：“把他扔下来！”他们就把他扔下来。他的血溅在墙上和马上；于是把他践踏了。
{2Ki 9:34}  Then he went in and ate and drank. And he said, "See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter."
{2Ki 9:34}  耶户进去，吃了喝了，吩咐说：“你们把这被咒诅的妇人葬埋了，因为他是王的女儿。”
{2Ki 9:35}  But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
{2Ki 9:35}  他们就去葬埋他，只寻得他的头骨和脚，并手掌。
{2Ki 9:36}  When they came back and told him, he said, "This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite: 'In the territory of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel,
{2Ki 9:36}  他们回去告诉耶户，耶户说：“这正应验耶和华藉他仆人提斯比人以利亚所说的话，说：‘在耶斯列田间，狗必吃耶洗别的肉；
{2Ki 9:37}  and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one can say, This is Jezebel.'"
{2Ki 9:37}  耶洗别的尸首必在耶斯列田间如同粪土，甚至人不能说这是耶洗别。’”
{2Ki 10:1}  Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of the city, to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab, saying,
{2Ki 10:1}  亚哈有七十个儿子在撒玛利亚。耶户写信送到撒玛利亚，通知耶斯列的首领，就是长老和教养亚哈众子的人，说：
{2Ki 10:2}  "Now then, as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities also, and weapons,
{2Ki 10:2}  “你们那里既有你们主人的众子和车马、器械、坚固城，
{2Ki 10:3}  select the best and fittest of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne and fight for your master's house."
{2Ki 10:3}  接了这信，就可以在你们主人的众子中选择一个贤能合宜的，使他坐他父亲的位，你们也可以为你们主人的家争战。”
{2Ki 10:4}  But they were exceedingly afraid and said, "Behold, the two kings could not stand before him. How then can we stand?"
{2Ki 10:4}  他们却甚惧怕，彼此说：“二王在他面前尚且站立不住，我们怎能站得住呢？”
{2Ki 10:5}  So he who was over the palace, and he who was over the city, together with the elders and the guardians, sent to Jehu, saying, "We are your servants, and we will do all that you tell us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your eyes."
{2Ki 10:5}  家宰、邑宰，和长老，并教养众子的人，打发人去见耶户，说：“我们是你的仆人，凡你所吩咐我们的都必遵行，我们不立谁作王，你看怎样好就怎样行。”
{2Ki 10:6}  Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, "If you are on my side, and if you are ready to obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time." Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were bringing them up.
{2Ki 10:6}  耶户又给他们写信说：“你们若归顺我，听从我的话，明日这时候，要将你们主人众子的首级带到耶斯列来见我。”那时王的儿子七十人都住在教养他们那城中的尊贵人家里。
{2Ki 10:7}  And as soon as the letter came to them, they took the king's sons and slaughtered them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.
{2Ki 10:7}  信一到，他们就把王的七十个儿子杀了，将首级装在筐里，送到在耶斯列的耶户那里。
{2Ki 10:8}  When the messenger came and told him, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons," he said, "Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning."
{2Ki 10:8}  有使者来告诉耶户说：“他们将王众子的首级送来了。”耶户说：“将首级在城门口堆作两堆，搁到明日。”
{2Ki 10:9}  Then in the morning, when he went out, he stood and said to all the people, "You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who struck down all these?
{2Ki 10:9}  次日早晨，耶户出来，站着对众民说：“你们都是公义的，我背叛我主人，将他杀了；这些人却是谁杀的呢？
{2Ki 10:10} Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab, for the LORD has done what he said by his servant Elijah."
{2Ki 10:10} 由此可知，耶和华指着亚哈家所说的话一句没有落空，因为耶和华藉他仆人以利亚所说的话都成就了。”
{2Ki 10:11} So Jehu struck down all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all his great men and his close friends and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
{2Ki 10:11} 凡亚哈家在耶斯列所剩下的人和他的大臣、密友、祭司，耶户尽都杀了，没有留下一个。
{2Ki 10:12} Then he set out and went to Samaria. On the way, when he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,
{2Ki 10:12} 耶户起身往撒玛利亚去。在路上、牧人剪羊毛之处，
{2Ki 10:13} Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah, and he said, "Who are you?" And they answered, "We are the relatives of Ahaziah, and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother."
{2Ki 10:13} 遇见犹大王亚哈谢的弟兄，问他们说：“你们是谁？”回答说：“我们是亚哈谢的弟兄，现在下去要问王和太后的众子安。”
{2Ki 10:14} He said, "Take them alive." And they took them alive and slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two persons, and he spared none of them.
{2Ki 10:14} 耶户吩咐说：“活捉他们！”跟从的人就活捉了他们，将他们杀在剪羊毛之处的坑边，共四十二人，没有留下一个。
{2Ki 10:15} And when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. And he greeted him and said to him, "Is your heart true to my heart as mine is to yours?" And Jehonadab answered, "It is." Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." So he gave him his hand. And Jehu took him up with him into the chariot.
{2Ki 10:15} 耶户从那里前行，恰遇利甲的儿子约拿达来迎接他，耶户问他安，对他说：“你诚心待我像我诚心待你吗？”约拿达回答说：“是。”耶户说：“若是这样，你向我伸手”，他就伸手；耶户拉他上车。
{2Ki 10:16} And he said, "Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD." So he had him ride in his chariot.
{2Ki 10:16} 耶户说：“你和我同去，看我为耶和华怎样热心”；于是请他坐在车上，
{2Ki 10:17} And when he came to Samaria, he struck down all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had wiped them out, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke to Elijah.
{2Ki 10:17} 到了撒玛利亚，就把撒玛利亚的亚哈家剩下的人都杀了，直到灭尽，正如耶和华对以利亚所说的。
{2Ki 10:18} Then Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much.
{2Ki 10:18} 耶户招聚众民，对他们说：“亚哈事奉巴力还冷淡，耶户却更热心。
{2Ki 10:19} Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests. Let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live." But Jehu did it with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal.
{2Ki 10:19} 现在我要给巴力献大祭。应当叫巴力的众先知和一切拜巴力的人，并巴力的众祭司，都到我这里来，不可缺少一个；凡不来的必不得活。”耶户这样行，是用诡计要杀尽拜巴力的人。
{2Ki 10:20} And Jehu ordered, "Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal." So they proclaimed it.
{2Ki 10:20} 耶户说：“要为巴力宣告严肃会！”于是宣告了。
{2Ki 10:21} And Jehu sent throughout all Israel, and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they entered the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other.
{2Ki 10:21} 耶户差人走遍以色列地；凡拜巴力的人都来齐了，没有一个不来的。他们进了巴力庙，巴力庙中从前边直到后边都满了人。
{2Ki 10:22} He said to him who was in charge of the wardrobe, "Bring out the vestments for all the worshipers of Baal." So he brought out the vestments for them.
{2Ki 10:22} 耶户吩咐掌管礼服的人说：“拿出礼服来，给一切拜巴力的人穿。”他就拿出礼服来给了他们。
{2Ki 10:23} Then Jehu went into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab, and he said to the worshipers of Baal, "Search, and see that there is no servant of the LORD here among you, but only the worshipers of Baal."
{2Ki 10:23} 耶户和利甲的儿子约拿达进了巴力庙，对拜巴力的人说：“你们察看察看，在你们这里不可有耶和华的仆人，只可容留拜巴力的人。”
{2Ki 10:24} Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and said, "The man who allows any of those whom I give into your hands to escape shall forfeit his life."
{2Ki 10:24} 耶户和约拿达进去，献平安祭和燔祭。耶户先安排八十人在庙外，吩咐说：“我将这些人交在你们手中，若有一人脱逃，谁放的必叫他偿命！”
{2Ki 10:25} So as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the officers, "Go in and strike them down; let not a man escape." So when they put them to the sword, the guard and the officers cast them out and went into the inner room of the house of Baal,
{2Ki 10:25} 耶户献完了燔祭，就出来吩咐护卫兵和众军长说：“你们进去杀他们，不容一人出来！”护卫兵和军长就用刀杀他们，将尸首抛出去，便到巴力庙的城去了，
{2Ki 10:26} and they brought out the pillar that was in the house of Baal and burned it.
{2Ki 10:26} 将巴力庙中的柱像都拿出来烧了；
{2Ki 10:27} And they demolished the pillar of Baal, and demolished the house of Baal, and made it a latrine to this day.
{2Ki 10:27} 毁坏了巴力柱像，拆毁了巴力庙作为厕所，直到今日。
{2Ki 10:28} Thus Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel.
{2Ki 10:28} 这样，耶户在以色列中灭了巴力。
{2Ki 10:29} But Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin--that is, the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan.
{2Ki 10:29} 只是耶户不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，就是拜伯特利和但的金牛犊。
{2Ki 10:30} And the LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel."
{2Ki 10:30} 耶和华对耶户说：“因你办好我眼中看为正的事，照我的心意待亚哈家，你的子孙必接续你坐以色列的国位，直到四代。”
{2Ki 10:31} But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam, which he made Israel to sin.
{2Ki 10:31} 只是耶户不尽心遵守耶和华以色列神的律法，不离开耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。
{2Ki 10:32} In those days the LORD began to cut off parts of Israel. Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel:
{2Ki 10:32} 在那些日子，耶和华才割裂以色列国，使哈薛攻击以色列的境界，
{2Ki 10:33} from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the Valley of the Arnon, that is, Gilead and Bashan.
{2Ki 10:33} 乃是约但河东、基列全地，从靠近亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥起，就是基列和巴珊的迦得人、流便人、玛拿西人之地。
{2Ki 10:34} Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{2Ki 10:34} 耶户其余的事，凡他所行的和他的勇力都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ki 10:35} So Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 10:35} 耶户与他列祖同睡，葬在撒玛利亚；他儿子约哈斯接续他作王。
{2Ki 10:36} The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
{2Ki 10:36} 耶户在撒玛利亚作以色列王二十八年。
{2Ki 11:1}  Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family.
{2Ki 11:1}  亚哈谢的母亲亚他利雅见他儿子死了，就起来剿灭王室。
{2Ki 11:2}  But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king's sons who were being put to death, and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not put to death.
{2Ki 11:2}  但约兰王的女儿，亚哈谢的妹子约示巴，将亚哈谢的儿子约阿施从那被杀的王子中偷出来，把他和他的乳母都藏在卧房里，躲避亚他利雅，免得被杀。
{2Ki 11:3}  And he remained with her six years, hidden in the house of the LORD, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
{2Ki 11:3}  约阿施和他的乳母藏在耶和华的殿里六年；亚他利雅篡了国位。
{2Ki 11:4}  But in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of the Carites and of the guards, and had them come to him in the house of the LORD. And he made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the LORD, and he showed them the king's son.
{2Ki 11:4}  第七年，耶何耶大打发人叫迦利人（或作：亲兵）和护卫兵的众百夫长来，领他们进了耶和华的殿，与他们立约，使他们在耶和华殿里起誓，又将王的儿子指给他们看，
{2Ki 11:5}  And he commanded them, "This is the thing that you shall do: one third of you, those who come off duty on the Sabbath and guard the king's house
{2Ki 11:5}  吩咐他们说：“你们当这样行：凡安息日进班的三分之一要看守王宫，
{2Ki 11:6}  (another third being at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guards) shall guard the palace.
{2Ki 11:6}  三分之一要在苏珥门，三分之一要在护卫兵院的后门。这样把守王宫，拦阻闲人。
{2Ki 11:7}  And the two divisions of you, which come on duty in force on the Sabbath and guard the house of the LORD on behalf of the king,
{2Ki 11:7}  你们安息日所有出班的三分之二要在耶和华的殿里护卫王；
{2Ki 11:8}  shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand. And whoever approaches the ranks is to be put to death. Be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in."
{2Ki 11:8}  各人手拿兵器，四围护卫王。凡擅入你们班次的必当治死，王出入的时候，你们当跟随他。”
{2Ki 11:9}  The captains did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and they each brought his men who were to go off duty on the Sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
{2Ki 11:9}  众百夫长就照着祭司耶何耶大一切所吩咐的去行，各带所管安息日进班出班的人来见祭司耶何耶大。
{2Ki 11:10} And the priest gave to the captains the spears and shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of the LORD.
{2Ki 11:10} 祭司便将耶和华殿里所藏大卫王的枪和盾牌交给百夫长。
{2Ki 11:11} And the guards stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house on behalf of the king.
{2Ki 11:11} 护卫兵手中各拿兵器，在坛和殿那里，从殿右直到殿左，站在王子的四围。
{2Ki 11:12} Then he brought out the king's son and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony. And they proclaimed him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, "Long live the king!"
{2Ki 11:12} 祭司领王子出来，给他戴上冠冕，将律法书交给他，膏他作王；众人就拍掌说：“愿王万岁！”
{2Ki 11:13} When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she went into the house of the LORD to the people.
{2Ki 11:13} 亚他利雅听见护卫兵和民的声音，就到民那里，进耶和华的殿，
{2Ki 11:14} And when she looked, there was the king standing by the pillar, according to the custom, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. And Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, "Treason! Treason!"
{2Ki 11:14} 看见王照例站在柱旁，百夫长和吹号的人侍立在王左右，国中的众民欢乐吹号；亚他利雅就撕裂衣服，喊叫说：“反了！反了！”
{2Ki 11:15} Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains who were set over the army, "Bring her out between the ranks, and put to death with the sword anyone who follows her." For the priest said, "Let her not be put to death in the house of the LORD."
{2Ki 11:15} 祭司耶何耶大吩咐管辖军兵的百夫长说：“将他赶出班外，凡跟随他的必用刀杀死！”因为祭司说“不可在耶和华殿里杀他”，
{2Ki 11:16} So they laid hands on her; and she went through the horses' entrance to the king's house, and there she was put to death.
{2Ki 11:16} 众兵就闪开让他去；他从马路上王宫去，便在那里被杀。
{2Ki 11:17} And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and people, that they should be the LORD's people, and also between the king and the people.
{2Ki 11:17} 耶何耶大使王和民与耶和华立约，作耶和华的民；又使王与民立约。
{2Ki 11:18} Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest posted watchmen over the house of the LORD.
{2Ki 11:18} 于是国民都到巴力庙，拆毁了庙，打碎坛和像，又在坛前将巴力的祭司玛坦杀了。祭司耶何耶大派官看守耶和华的殿，
{2Ki 11:19} And he took the captains, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, marching through the gate of the guards to the king's house. And he took his seat on the throne of the kings.
{2Ki 11:19} 又率领百夫长和迦利人（或作：亲兵）与护卫兵，以及国中的众民，请王从耶和华殿下来，由护卫兵的门进入王宫，他就坐了王位。
{2Ki 11:20} So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been put to death with the sword at the king's house.
{2Ki 11:20} 国民都欢乐，合城都安静。众人已将亚他利雅在王宫那里用刀杀了。
{2Ki 11:21} Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
{2Ki 11:21} 约阿施登基的时候年方七岁。
{2Ki 12:1}  In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
{2Ki 12:1}  耶户第七年，约阿施登基，在耶路撒冷作王四十年。他母亲名叫西比亚，是别是巴人。
{2Ki 12:2}  And Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all his days, because Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
{2Ki 12:2}  约阿施在祭司耶何耶大教训他的时候，就行耶和华眼中看为正的事；
{2Ki 12:3}  Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away; the people continued to sacrifice and make offerings on the high places.
{2Ki 12:3}  只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓仍在那里献祭烧香。
{2Ki 12:4}  Jehoash said to the priests, "All the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of the LORD, the money for which each man is assessed--the money from the assessment of persons--and the money that a man's heart prompts him to bring into the house of the LORD,
{2Ki 12:4}  约阿施对众祭司说：“凡奉到耶和华殿分别为圣之物所值通用的银子，或各人当纳的身价，或乐意奉到耶和华殿的银子，
{2Ki 12:5}  let the priests take, each from his donor, and let them repair the house wherever any need of repairs is discovered."
{2Ki 12:5}  你们当从所认识的人收了来，修理殿的一切破坏之处。”
{2Ki 12:6}  But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, the priests had made no repairs on the house.
{2Ki 12:6}  无奈到了约阿施王二十三年，祭司仍未修理殿的破坏之处。
{2Ki 12:7}  Therefore King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them, "Why are you not repairing the house? Now therefore take no more money from your donors, but hand it over for the repair of the house."
{2Ki 12:7}  所以约阿施王召了大祭司耶何耶大和众祭司来，对他们说：“你们怎么不修理殿的破坏之处呢？从今以后，你们不要从所认识的人再收银子，要将所收的交出来，修理殿的破坏之处。”
{2Ki 12:8}  So the priests agreed that they should take no more money from the people, and that they should not repair the house.
{2Ki 12:8}  众祭司答应不再收百姓的银子，也不修理殿的破坏之处。
{2Ki 12:9}  Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the house of the LORD. And the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.
{2Ki 12:9}  祭司耶何耶大取了一个柜子，在柜盖上钻了一个窟窿，放于坛旁，在进耶和华殿的右边；守门的祭司将奉到耶和华殿的一切银子投在柜里。
{2Ki 12:10} And whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest came up and they bagged and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD.
{2Ki 12:10} 他们见柜里的银子多了，便叫王的书记和大祭司上来，将耶和华殿里的银子数算包起来。
{2Ki 12:11} Then they would give the money that was weighed out into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD. And they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked on the house of the LORD,
{2Ki 12:11} 把所平的银子交给督工的，就是耶和华殿里办事的人；他们把银子转交修理耶和华殿的木匠和工人，
{2Ki 12:12} and to the masons and the stonecutters, as well as to buy timber and quarried stone for making repairs on the house of the LORD, and for any outlay for the repairs of the house.
{2Ki 12:12} 并瓦匠、石匠，又买木料和凿成的石头，修理耶和华殿的破坏之处，以及修理殿的各样使用。
{2Ki 12:13} But there were not made for the house of the LORD basins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any vessels of gold, or of silver, from the money that was brought into the house of the LORD,
{2Ki 12:13} 但那奉到耶和华殿的银子，没有用以做耶和华殿里的银杯、蜡剪、碗、号，和别样的金银器皿，
{2Ki 12:14} for that was given to the workmen who were repairing the house of the LORD with it.
{2Ki 12:14} 乃将那银子交给督工的人修理耶和华的殿；
{2Ki 12:15} And they did not ask for an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to pay out to the workmen, for they dealt honestly.
{2Ki 12:15} 且将银子交给办事的人转交做工的人，不与他们算账，因为他们办事诚实。
{2Ki 12:16} The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD; it belonged to the priests.
{2Ki 12:16} 惟有赎愆祭、赎罪祭的银子没有奉到耶和华的殿，都归祭司。
{2Ki 12:17} At that time Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath and took it. But when Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem,
{2Ki 12:17} 那时，亚兰王哈薛上来攻打迦特，攻取了，就定意上来攻打耶路撒冷。
{2Ki 12:18} Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred gifts that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred gifts, and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent these to Hazael king of Syria. Then Hazael went away from Jerusalem.
{2Ki 12:18} 犹大王约阿施将他列祖犹大王约沙法、约兰、亚哈谢所分别为圣的物和自己所分别为圣的物，并耶和华殿与王宫府库里所有的金子都送给亚兰王哈薛；哈薛就不上耶路撒冷来了。
{2Ki 12:19} Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 12:19} 约阿施其余的事，凡他所行的都写在犹大列王记上。
{2Ki 12:20} His servants arose and made a conspiracy and struck down Joash in the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.
{2Ki 12:20} 约阿施的臣仆起来背叛，在下悉拉的米罗宫那里将他杀了。
{2Ki 12:21} It was Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, who struck him down, so that he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 12:21} 杀他的那臣仆就是示米押的儿子约撒甲和朔默的儿子约萨拔。众人将他葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子亚玛谢接续他作王。
{2Ki 13:1}  In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years.
{2Ki 13:1}  犹大王亚哈谢的儿子约阿施二十三年，耶户的儿子约哈斯在撒玛利亚登基作以色列王十七年。
{2Ki 13:2}  He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from them.
{2Ki 13:2}  约哈斯行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，总不离开。
{2Ki 13:3}  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he gave them continually into the hand of Hazael king of Syria and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael.
{2Ki 13:3}  于是，耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作，将他们屡次交在亚兰王哈薛和他儿子便哈达的手里。
{2Ki 13:4}  Then Jehoahaz sought the favor of the LORD, and the LORD listened to him, for he saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Syria oppressed them.
{2Ki 13:4}  约哈斯恳求耶和华，耶和华就应允他，因为见以色列人所受亚兰王的欺压。
{2Ki 13:5}  (Therefore the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they escaped from the hand of the Syrians, and the people of Israel lived in their homes as formerly.
{2Ki 13:5}  耶和华赐给以色列人一位拯救者，使他们脱离亚兰人的手；于是以色列人仍旧安居在家里。
{2Ki 13:6}  Nevertheless, they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he made Israel to sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained in Samaria.)
{2Ki 13:6}  然而他们不离开耶罗波安家使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，仍然去行，并且在撒玛利亚留下亚舍拉。
{2Ki 13:7}  For there was not left to Jehoahaz an army of more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen, for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.
{2Ki 13:7}  亚兰王灭绝约哈斯的民，践踏他们如禾场上的尘沙，只给约哈斯留下五十马兵，十辆战车，一万步兵。
{2Ki 13:8}  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{2Ki 13:8}  约哈斯其余的事，凡他所行的和他的勇力都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ki 13:9}  So Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria, and Joash his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 13:9}  约哈斯与他列祖同睡，葬在撒玛利亚。他儿子约阿施接续他作王。
{2Ki 13:10} In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.
{2Ki 13:10} 犹大王约阿施三十七年，约哈斯的儿子约阿施在撒玛利亚登基作以色列王十六年。
{2Ki 13:11} He also did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin, but he walked in them.
{2Ki 13:11} 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的一切罪，仍然去行。
{2Ki 13:12} Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, and the might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{2Ki 13:12} 约阿施其余的事，凡他所行的和他与犹大王亚玛谢争战的勇力，都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ki 13:13} So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
{2Ki 13:13} 约阿施与他列祖同睡，耶罗波安坐了他的位。约阿施与以色列诸王一同葬在撒玛利亚。
{2Ki 13:14} Now when Elisha had fallen sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joash king of Israel went down to him and wept before him, crying, "My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!"
{2Ki 13:14} 以利沙得了必死的病，以色列王约阿施下来看他，伏在他脸上哭泣，说：“我父啊！我父啊！以色列的战车马兵啊！”
{2Ki 13:15} And Elisha said to him, "Take a bow and arrows." So he took a bow and arrows.
{2Ki 13:15} 以利沙对他说：“你取弓箭来。”王就取了弓箭来；
{2Ki 13:16} Then he said to the king of Israel, "Draw the bow," and he drew it. And Elisha laid his hands on the king's hands.
{2Ki 13:16} 又对以色列王说：“你用手拿弓。”王就用手拿弓。以利沙按手在王的手上，
{2Ki 13:17} And he said, "Open the window eastward," and he opened it. Then Elisha said, "Shoot," and he shot. And he said, "The LORD's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria! For you shall fight the Syrians in Aphek until you have made an end of them."
{2Ki 13:17} 说：“你开朝东的窗户。”他就开了。以利沙说：“射箭吧！”他就射箭。以利沙说：“这是耶和华的得胜箭，就是战胜亚兰人的箭；因为你必在亚弗攻打亚兰人，直到灭尽他们。”
{2Ki 13:18} And he said, "Take the arrows," and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, "Strike the ground with them." And he struck three times and stopped.
{2Ki 13:18} 以利沙又说：“取几枝箭来。”他就取了来。以利沙说：“打地吧！”他打了三次，便止住了。
{2Ki 13:19} Then the man of God was angry with him and said, "You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria until you had made an end of it, but now you will strike down Syria only three times."
{2Ki 13:19} 神人向他发怒，说：“应当击打五六次，就能攻打亚兰人直到灭尽；现在只能打败亚兰人三次。”
{2Ki 13:20} So Elisha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year.
{2Ki 13:20} 以利沙死了，人将他葬埋。到了新年，有一群摩押人犯境，
{2Ki 13:21} And as a man was being buried, behold, a marauding band was seen and the man was thrown into the grave of Elisha, and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood on his feet.
{2Ki 13:21} 有人正葬死人，忽然看见一群人，就把死人抛在以利沙的坟墓里，一碰着以利沙的骸骨，死人就复活，站起来了。
{2Ki 13:22} Now Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
{2Ki 13:22} 约哈斯年间，亚兰王哈薛屡次欺压以色列人。
{2Ki 13:23} But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them, and he turned toward them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, nor has he cast them from his presence until now.
{2Ki 13:23} 耶和华却因与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所立的约，仍施恩给以色列人，怜恤他们，眷顾他们，不肯灭尽他们，尚未赶逐他们离开自己面前。
{2Ki 13:24} When Hazael king of Syria died, Ben-hadad his son became king in his place.
{2Ki 13:24} 亚兰王哈薛死了，他儿子便哈达接续他作王。
{2Ki 13:25} Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities that he had taken from Jehoahaz his father in war. Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.
{2Ki 13:25} 从前哈薛和约阿施的父亲约哈斯争战，攻取了些城邑，现在约哈斯的儿子约阿施三次打败哈薛的儿子便哈达，就收回了以色列的城邑。
{2Ki 14:1}  In the second year of Joash the son of Joahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, began to reign.
{2Ki 14:1}  以色列王约哈斯的儿子约阿施第二年，犹大王约阿施的儿子亚玛谢登基。
{2Ki 14:2}  He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
{2Ki 14:2}  他登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十九年。他母亲名叫约耶但，是耶路撒冷人。
{2Ki 14:3}  And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not like David his father. He did in all things as Joash his father had done.
{2Ki 14:3}  亚玛谢行耶和华眼中看为正的事，但不如他祖大卫，乃效法他父约阿施一切所行的；
{2Ki 14:4}  But the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places.
{2Ki 14:4}  只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓仍在那里献祭烧香。
{2Ki 14:5}  And as soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand, he struck down his servants who had struck down the king his father.
{2Ki 14:5}  国一坚定，就把杀他父王的臣仆杀了，
{2Ki 14:6}  But he did not put to death the children of the murderers, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where the LORD commanded, "Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children, nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers. But each one shall die for his own sin."
{2Ki 14:6}  却没有治死杀王之人的儿子，是照摩西律法书上耶和华所吩咐的说：“不可因子杀父，也不可因父杀子，各人要为本身的罪而死。”
{2Ki 14:7}  He struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and took Sela by storm, and called it Joktheel, which is its name to this day.
{2Ki 14:7}  亚玛谢在盐谷杀了以东人一万，又攻取了西拉，改名叫约帖，直到今日。
{2Ki 14:8}  Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face."
{2Ki 14:8}  那时，亚玛谢差遣使者去见耶户的孙子约哈斯的儿子以色列王约阿施，说：“你来，我们二人相见于战场。”
{2Ki 14:9}  And Jehoash king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah, "A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son for a wife,' and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle.
{2Ki 14:9}  以色列王约阿施差遣使者去见犹大王亚玛谢，说：“利巴嫩的蒺藜差遣使者去见利巴嫩的香柏树，说：将你的女儿给我儿子为妻。后来利巴嫩有一个野兽经过，把蒺藜践踏了。
{2Ki 14:10} You have indeed struck down Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your glory, and stay at home, for why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?"
{2Ki 14:10} 你打败了以东人就心高气傲，你以此为荣耀，在家里安居就罢了，为何要惹祸，使自己和犹大国一同败亡呢？”
{2Ki 14:11} But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
{2Ki 14:11} 亚玛谢却不肯听这话。于是以色列王约阿施上来，在犹大的伯示麦与犹大王亚玛谢相见于战场。
{2Ki 14:12} And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
{2Ki 14:12} 犹大人败在以色列人面前，各自逃回家里去了。
{2Ki 14:13} And Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate.
{2Ki 14:13} 以色列王约阿施在伯示麦擒住亚哈谢的孙子、约阿施的儿子犹大王亚玛谢，就来到耶路撒冷，拆毁耶路撒冷的城墙，从以法莲门直到角门共四百肘，
{2Ki 14:14} And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king's house, also hostages, and he returned to Samaria.
{2Ki 14:14} 又将耶和华殿里与王宫府库里所有的金银和器皿都拿了去，并带人去为质，就回撒玛利亚去了。
{2Ki 14:15} Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash that he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{2Ki 14:15} 约阿施其余所行的事和他的勇力，并与犹大王亚玛谢争战的事，都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ki 14:16} And Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel, and Jeroboam his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 14:16} 约阿施与他列祖同睡，葬在撒玛利亚，以色列诸王的坟地里。他儿子耶罗波安接续他作王。
{2Ki 14:17} Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
{2Ki 14:17} 以色列王约哈斯的儿子约阿施死后，犹大王约阿施的儿子亚玛谢又活了十五年。
{2Ki 14:18} Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 14:18} 亚玛谢其余的事都写在犹大列王记上。
{2Ki 14:19} And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there.
{2Ki 14:19} 耶路撒冷有人背叛亚玛谢，他就逃到拉吉；叛党却打发人到拉吉将他杀了。
{2Ki 14:20} And they brought him on horses; and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
{2Ki 14:20} 人就用马将他的尸首驮到耶路撒冷，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。
{2Ki 14:21} And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
{2Ki 14:21} 犹大众民立亚玛谢的儿子亚撒利雅（又名乌西雅）接续他父作王，那时他年十六岁。
{2Ki 14:22} He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
{2Ki 14:22} 亚玛谢与他列祖同睡之后，亚撒利雅收回以拉他仍归犹大，又重新修理。
{2Ki 14:23} In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, began to reign in Samaria, and he reigned forty-one years.
{2Ki 14:23} 犹大王约阿施的儿子亚玛谢十五年，以色列王约阿施的儿子耶罗波安在撒玛利亚登基，作王四十一年。
{2Ki 14:24} And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
{2Ki 14:24} 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的一切罪。
{2Ki 14:25} He restored the border of Israel from Lebo-hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was from Gath-hepher.
{2Ki 14:25} 他收回以色列边界之地，从哈马口直到亚拉巴海，正如耶和华以色列的神藉他仆人迦特希弗人亚米太的儿子先知约拿所说的。
{2Ki 14:26} For the LORD saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter, for there was none left, bond or free, and there was none to help Israel.
{2Ki 14:26} 因为耶和华看见以色列人甚是艰苦，无论困住的、自由的都没有了，也无人帮助以色列人。
{2Ki 14:27} But the LORD had not said that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, so he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
{2Ki 14:27} 耶和华并没有说要将以色列的名从天下涂抹，乃藉约阿施的儿子耶罗波安拯救他们。
{2Ki 14:28} Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah in Israel, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
{2Ki 14:28} 耶罗波安其余的事，凡他所行的和他的勇力，他怎样争战，怎样收回大马色和先前属犹大的哈马归以色列，都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ki 14:29} And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel, and Zechariah his son reigned in his place.

{2Ki 15:1}  以色列王耶罗波安二十七年，犹大王亚玛谢的儿子亚撒利雅登基，
{2Ki 15:2}  He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
{2Ki 15:2}  他登基的时候年十六岁，在耶路撒冷作王五十二年。他母亲名叫耶可利雅，是耶路撒冷人。
{2Ki 15:3}  And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
{2Ki 15:3}  亚撒利雅行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他父亲亚玛谢一切所行的；
{2Ki 15:4}  Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places.
{2Ki 15:4}  只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓仍在那里献祭烧香。
{2Ki 15:5}  And the LORD touched the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and he lived in a separate house. And Jotham the king's son was over the household, governing the people of the land.
{2Ki 15:5}  耶和华降灾与王，使他长大麻疯，直到死日，他就住在别的宫里。他的儿子约坦管理家事，治理国民。
{2Ki 15:6}  Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 15:6}  亚撒利雅其余的事，凡他所行的都写在犹大列王记上。

{2Ki 15:9}  And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
{2Ki 15:9}  他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法他列祖所行的，不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。
{2Ki 15:10} Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him and struck him down at Ibleam and put him to death and reigned in his place.
{2Ki 15:10} 雅比的儿子沙龙背叛他，在百姓面前击杀他，篡了他的位。
{2Ki 15:11} Now the rest of the deeds of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
{2Ki 15:11} 撒迦利雅其余的事都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ki 15:12} (This was the promise of the LORD that he gave to Jehu, "Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation." And so it came to pass.)
{2Ki 15:12} 这是从前耶和华应许耶户说：“你的子孙必坐以色列的国位直到四代。”这话果然应验了。
{2Ki 15:13} Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned one month in Samaria.
{2Ki 15:13} 犹大王乌西雅（就是亚撒利雅）三十九年，雅比的儿子沙龙登基在撒玛利亚作王一个月。
{2Ki 15:14} Then Menahem the son of Gadi came up from Tirzah and came to Samaria, and he struck down Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and put him to death and reigned in his place.
{2Ki 15:14} 迦底的儿子米拿现从得撒上撒玛利亚，杀了雅比的儿子沙龙，篡了他的位。
{2Ki 15:15} Now the rest of the deeds of Shallum, and the conspiracy that he made, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
{2Ki 15:15} 沙龙其余的事和他背叛的情形都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ki 15:16} At that time Menahem sacked Tiphsah and all who were in it and its territory from Tirzah on, because they did not open it to him. Therefore he sacked it, and he ripped open all the women in it who were pregnant.
{2Ki 15:16} 那时米拿现从得撒起攻打提斐萨和其四境，击杀城中一切的人，剖开其中所有的孕妇，都因他们没有给他开城。

{2Ki 15:19} 亚述王普勒来攻击以色列国，米拿现给他一千他连得银子，请普勒帮助他坚定国位。
{2Ki 15:20} Menahem exacted the money from Israel, that is, from all the wealthy men, fifty shekels of silver from every man, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back and did not stay there in the land.
{2Ki 15:20} 米拿现向以色列一切大富户索要银子，使他们各出五十舍客勒，就给了亚述王。于是亚述王回去，不在国中停留。
{2Ki 15:21} Now the rest of the deeds of Menahem and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

{2Ki 15:25} 比加辖的将军、利玛利的儿子比加背叛他，在撒玛利亚王宫里的卫所杀了他。亚珥歌伯和亚利耶并基列的五十人帮助比加；比加击杀他，篡了他的位。
{2Ki 15:26} Now the rest of the deeds of Pekahiah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
{2Ki 15:26} 比加辖其余的事，凡他所行的都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ki 15:27} In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twenty years.
{2Ki 15:27} 犹大王亚撒利雅五十二年，利玛利的儿子比加在撒玛利亚登基作以色列王二十年。
{2Ki 15:28} And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
{2Ki 15:28} 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。
{2Ki 15:29} In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and he carried the people captive to Assyria.
{2Ki 15:29} 以色列王比加年间，亚述王提革拉毗列色来夺了以云、亚伯伯玛迦、亚挪、基低斯、夏琐、基列、加利利，和拿弗他利全地，将这些地方的居民都掳到亚述去了。
{2Ki 15:30} Then Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah and struck him down and put him to death and reigned in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
{2Ki 15:30} 乌西雅的儿子约坦二十年，以拉的儿子何细亚背叛利玛利的儿子比加，击杀他，篡了他的位。
{2Ki 15:31} Now the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
{2Ki 15:31} 比加其余的事，凡他所行的都写在以色列诸王记上。
{2Ki 15:32} In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, began to reign.
{2Ki 15:32} 以色列王利玛利的儿子比加第二年，犹大王乌西雅的儿子约坦登基。
{2Ki 15:33} He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
{2Ki 15:33} 他登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王十六年。他母亲名叫耶路沙，是撒督的女儿。
{2Ki 15:34} And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
{2Ki 15:34} 约坦行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他父亲乌西雅一切所行的；
{2Ki 15:35} Nevertheless, the high places were not removed. The people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD.
{2Ki 15:35} 只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓仍在那里献祭烧香。约坦建立耶和华殿的上门。
{2Ki 15:36} Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 15:36} 约坦其余的事，凡他所行的都写在犹大列王记上。
{2Ki 15:37} In those days the LORD began to send Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah.
{2Ki 15:37} 在那些日子，耶和华才使亚兰王利汛和利玛利的儿子比加去攻击犹大。
{2Ki 15:38} Jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 15:38} 约坦与他列祖同睡，葬在他祖大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子亚哈斯接续他作王。
{2Ki 16:1}  In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to reign.
{2Ki 16:1}  利玛利的儿子比加十七年，犹大王约坦的儿子亚哈斯登基。
{2Ki 16:2}  Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God, as his father David had done,
{2Ki 16:2}  他登基的时候年二十岁，在耶路撒冷作王十六年；不像他祖大卫行耶和华他神眼中看为正的事，
{2Ki 16:3}  but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. He even burned his son as an offering, according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
{2Ki 16:3}  却效法以色列诸王所行的，又照着耶和华从以色列人面前赶出的外邦人所行可憎的事，使他的儿子经火，
{2Ki 16:4}  And he sacrificed and made offerings on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
{2Ki 16:4}  并在邱坛上、山冈上、各青翠树下献祭烧香。
{2Ki 16:5}  Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to wage war on Jerusalem, and they besieged Ahaz but could not conquer him.
{2Ki 16:5}  亚兰王利汛和以色列王利玛利的儿子比加上来攻打耶路撒冷，围困亚哈斯，却不能胜他。
{2Ki 16:6}  At that time Rezin the king of Syria recovered Elath for Syria and drove the men of Judah from Elath, and the Edomites came to Elath, where they dwell to this day.
{2Ki 16:6}  当时亚兰王利汛收回以拉他归与亚兰，将犹大人从以拉他赶出去。亚兰人（有译以东人的）就来到以拉他，住在那里，直到今日。
{2Ki 16:7}  So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, "I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are attacking me."
{2Ki 16:7}  亚哈斯差遣使者去见亚述王提革拉毗列色，说：“我是你的仆人、你的儿子。现在亚兰王和以色列王攻击我，求你来救我脱离他们的手。”
{2Ki 16:8}  Ahaz also took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the king's house and sent a present to the king of Assyria.
{2Ki 16:8}  亚哈斯将耶和华殿里和王宫府库里所有的金银都送给亚述王为礼物。
{2Ki 16:9}  And the king of Assyria listened to him. The king of Assyria marched up against Damascus and took it, carrying its people captive to Kir, and he killed Rezin.
{2Ki 16:9}  亚述王应允了他，就上去攻打大马色，将城攻取，杀了利汛，把居民掳到吉珥。
{2Ki 16:10} When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, he saw the altar that was at Damascus. And King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest a model of the altar, and its pattern, exact in all its details.
{2Ki 16:10} 亚哈斯王上大马色去迎接亚述王提革拉毗列色，在大马色看见一座坛，就照坛的规模样式作法画了图样，送到祭司乌利亚那里。
{2Ki 16:11} And Uriah the priest built the altar; in accordance with all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Uriah the priest made it, before King Ahaz arrived from Damascus.
{2Ki 16:11} 祭司乌利亚照着亚哈斯王从大马色送来的图样，在亚哈斯王没有从大马色回来之先，建筑一座坛。
{2Ki 16:12} And when the king came from Damascus, the king viewed the altar. Then the king drew near to the altar and went up on it
{2Ki 16:12} 王从大马色回来看见坛，就近前来，在坛上献祭；
{2Ki 16:13} and burned his burnt offering and his grain offering and poured his drink offering and threw the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.
{2Ki 16:13} 烧燔祭、素祭、浇奠祭，将平安祭牲的血洒在坛上，
{2Ki 16:14} And the bronze altar that was before the LORD he removed from the front of the house, from the place between his altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of his altar.
{2Ki 16:14} 又将耶和华面前的铜坛从耶和华殿和新坛的中间搬到新坛的北边。
{2Ki 16:15} And King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, "On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering and the king's burnt offering and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their grain offering and their drink offering. And throw on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice, but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by."
{2Ki 16:15} 亚哈斯王吩咐祭司乌利亚说：“早晨的燔祭、晚上的素祭，王的燔祭、素祭，国内众民的燔祭、素祭、奠祭都要烧在大坛上。燔祭牲和平安祭牲的血也要洒在这坛上，只是铜坛我要用以求问耶和华。”
{2Ki 16:16} Uriah the priest did all this, as King Ahaz commanded.
{2Ki 16:16} 祭司乌利亚就照着亚哈斯王所吩咐的行了。
{2Ki 16:17} And King Ahaz cut off the frames of the stands and removed the basin from them, and he took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a stone pedestal.
{2Ki 16:17} 亚哈斯王打掉盆座四面镶着的心子，把盆从座上挪下来，又将铜海从驮海的铜牛上搬下来，放在铺石地；
{2Ki 16:18} And the covered way for the Sabbath that had been built inside the house and the outer entrance for the king he caused to go around the house of the LORD, because of the king of Assyria.
{2Ki 16:18} 又因亚述王的缘故，将耶和华殿为安息日所盖的廊子和王从外入殿的廊子挪移，围绕耶和华的殿。
{2Ki 16:19} Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 16:19} 亚哈斯其余所行的事都写在犹大列王记上。
{2Ki 16:20} And Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 16:20} 亚哈斯与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子希西家接续他作王。
{2Ki 17:1}  In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel, and he reigned nine years.
{2Ki 17:1}  犹大王亚哈斯十二年，以拉的儿子何细亚在撒玛利亚登基作以色列王九年。
{2Ki 17:2}  And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him.
{2Ki 17:2}  他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，只是不像在他以前的以色列诸王。
{2Ki 17:3}  Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria. And Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute.
{2Ki 17:3}  亚述王撒缦以色上来攻击何细亚，何细亚就服事他，给他进贡。
{2Ki 17:4}  But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.
{2Ki 17:4}  何细亚背叛，差人去见埃及王梭，不照往年所行的与亚述王进贡。亚述王知道了，就把他锁禁，囚在监里。
{2Ki 17:5}  Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samaria, and for three years he besieged it.
{2Ki 17:5}  亚述王上来攻击以色列遍地，上到撒玛利亚，围困三年。
{2Ki 17:6}  In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria, and he carried the Israelites away to Assyria and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
{2Ki 17:6}  何细亚第九年亚述王攻取了撒玛利亚，将以色列人掳到亚述，把他们安置在哈腊与歌散的哈博河边，并玛代人的城邑。
{2Ki 17:7}  And this occurred because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods
{2Ki 17:7}  这是因以色列人得罪那领他们出埃及地、脱离埃及王法老手的耶和华他们的神，去敬畏别神，
{2Ki 17:8}  and walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel, and in the customs that the kings of Israel had practiced.
{2Ki 17:8}  随从耶和华在他们面前所赶出外邦人的风俗和以色列诸王所立的条规。
{2Ki 17:9}  And the people of Israel did secretly against the LORD their God things that were not right. They built for themselves high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city.
{2Ki 17:9}  以色列人暗中行不正的事，违背耶和华他们的神，在他们所有的城邑，从了望楼直到坚固城，建筑邱坛；
{2Ki 17:10} They set up for themselves pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree,
{2Ki 17:10} 在各高冈上、各青翠树下立柱像和木偶；
{2Ki 17:11} and there they made offerings on all the high places, as the nations did whom the LORD carried away before them. And they did wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger,
{2Ki 17:11} 在邱坛上烧香，效法耶和华在他们面前赶出的外邦人所行的，又行恶事惹动耶和华的怒气；
{2Ki 17:12} and they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, "You shall not do this."
{2Ki 17:12} 且事奉偶像，就是耶和华警戒他们不可行的。
{2Ki 17:13} Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, "Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the Law that I commanded your fathers, and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets."
{2Ki 17:13} 但耶和华藉众先知、先见劝戒以色列人和犹大人说：“当离开你们的恶行，谨守我的诫命律例，遵行我吩咐你们列祖，并藉我仆人众先知所传给你们的律法。”
{2Ki 17:14} But they would not listen, but were stubborn, as their fathers had been, who did not believe in the LORD their God.
{2Ki 17:14} 他们却不听从，竟硬着颈项，效法他们列祖，不信服耶和华他们的神，
{2Ki 17:15} They despised his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and the warnings that he gave them. They went after false idols and became false, and they followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom the LORD had commanded them that they should not do like them.
{2Ki 17:15} 厌弃他的律例和他与他们列祖所立的约，并劝戒他们的话，随从虚无的神，自己成为虚妄，效法周围的外邦人，就是耶和华嘱咐他们不可效法的；
{2Ki 17:16} And they abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made for themselves metal images of two calves; and they made an Asherah and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal.
{2Ki 17:16} 离弃耶和华他们神的一切诫命，为自己铸了两个牛犊的像，立了亚舍拉，敬拜天上的万象，事奉巴力，
{2Ki 17:17} And they burned their sons and their daughters as offerings and used divination and omens and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
{2Ki 17:17} 又使他们的儿女经火，用占卜，行法术卖了自己，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，惹动他的怒气。
{2Ki 17:18} Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight. None was left but the tribe of Judah only.
{2Ki 17:18} 所以耶和华向以色列人大大发怒，从自己面前赶出他们，只剩下犹大一个支派。
{2Ki 17:19} Judah also did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced.
{2Ki 17:19} 犹大人也不遵守耶和华他们神的诫命，随从以色列人所立的条规。
{2Ki 17:20} And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
{2Ki 17:20} 耶和华就厌弃以色列全族，使他们受苦，把他们交在抢夺他们的人手中，以致赶出他们离开自己面前，
{2Ki 17:21} When he had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. And Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD and made them commit great sin.
{2Ki 17:21} 将以色列国从大卫家夺回；他们就立尼八的儿子耶罗波安作王。耶罗波安引诱以色列人不随从耶和华，陷在大罪里。
{2Ki 17:22} The people of Israel walked in all the sins that Jeroboam did. They did not depart from them,
{2Ki 17:22} 以色列人犯耶罗波安所犯的一切罪，总不离开，
{2Ki 17:23} until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had spoken by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their own land to Assyria until this day.
{2Ki 17:23} 以致耶和华从自己面前赶出他们，正如藉他仆人众先知所说的。这样，以色列人从本地被掳到亚述，直到今日。
{2Ki 17:24} And the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the people of Israel. And they took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.
{2Ki 17:24} 亚述王从巴比伦、古他、亚瓦、哈马，和西法瓦音迁移人来，安置在撒玛利亚的城邑，代替以色列人；他们就得了撒玛利亚，住在其中。
{2Ki 17:25} And at the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear the LORD. Therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
{2Ki 17:25} 他们才住那里的时候，不敬畏耶和华，所以耶和华叫狮子进入他们中间，咬死了些人。
{2Ki 17:26} So the king of Assyria was told, "The nations that you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them, because they do not know the law of the god of the land."
{2Ki 17:26} 有人告诉亚述王说：“你所迁移安置在撒玛利亚各城的那些民，不知道那地之神的规矩，所以那神叫狮子进入他们中间，咬死他们。”
{2Ki 17:27} Then the king of Assyria commanded, "Send there one of the priests whom you carried away from there, and let him go and dwell there and teach them the law of the god of the land."
{2Ki 17:27} 亚述王就吩咐说：“叫所掳来的祭司回去一个，使他住在那里，将那地之神的规矩指教那些民。”
{2Ki 17:28} So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel and taught them how they should fear the LORD.
{2Ki 17:28} 于是有一个从撒玛利亚掳去的祭司回来，住在伯特利，指教他们怎样敬畏耶和华。
{2Ki 17:29} But every nation still made gods of its own and put them in the shrines of the high places that the Samaritans had made, every nation in the cities in which they lived.
{2Ki 17:29} 然而，各族之人在所住的城里各为自己制造神像，安置在撒玛利亚人所造有邱坛的殿中。
{2Ki 17:30} The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima,
{2Ki 17:30} 巴比伦人造疏割比讷像；古他人造匿甲像；哈马人造亚示玛像；
{2Ki 17:31} and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
{2Ki 17:31} 亚瓦人造匿哈和他珥他像；西法瓦音人用火焚烧儿女，献给西法瓦音的神亚得米勒和亚拿米勒。
{2Ki 17:32} They also feared the LORD and appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places.
{2Ki 17:32} 他们惧怕耶和华，也从他们中间立邱坛的祭司，为他们在有邱坛的殿中献祭。
{2Ki 17:33} So they feared the LORD but also served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
{2Ki 17:33} 他们又惧怕耶和华，又事奉自己的神，从何邦迁移，就随何邦的风俗。
{2Ki 17:34} To this day they do according to the former manner. They do not fear the LORD, and they do not follow the statutes or the rules or the law or the commandment that the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
{2Ki 17:34} 他们直到如今仍照先前的风俗去行，不专心敬畏耶和华，不全守自己的规矩、典章，也不遵守耶和华吩咐雅各后裔的律法、诫命。（雅各，就是从前耶和华起名叫以色列的。）
{2Ki 17:35} The LORD made a covenant with them and commanded them, "You shall not fear other gods or bow yourselves to them or serve them or sacrifice to them,
{2Ki 17:35} 耶和华曾与他们立约，嘱咐他们说：“不可敬畏别神，不可跪拜事奉他，也不可向他献祭。
{2Ki 17:36} but you shall fear the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm. You shall bow yourselves to him, and to him you shall sacrifice.
{2Ki 17:36} 但那用大能和伸出来的膀臂领你们出埃及地的耶和华，你们当敬畏，跪拜，向他献祭。
{2Ki 17:37} And the statutes and the rules and the law and the commandment that he wrote for you, you shall always be careful to do. You shall not fear other gods,
{2Ki 17:37} 他给你们写的律例、典章、律法、诫命，你们应当永远谨守遵行，不可敬畏别神。
{2Ki 17:38} and you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods,
{2Ki 17:38} 我耶和华与你们所立的约你们不可忘记，也不可敬畏别神。
{2Ki 17:39} but you shall fear the LORD your God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies."
{2Ki 17:39} 但要敬畏耶和华你们的神，他必救你们脱离一切仇敌的手。”
{2Ki 17:40} However, they would not listen, but they did according to their former manner.
{2Ki 17:40} 他们却不听从，仍照先前的风俗去行。
{2Ki 17:41} So these nations feared the LORD and also served their carved images. Their children did likewise, and their children's children--as their fathers did, so they do to this day.
{2Ki 17:41} 如此这些民又惧怕耶和华，又事奉他们的偶像。他们子子孙孙也都照样行，效法他们的祖宗，直到今日。
{2Ki 18:1}  In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began to reign.
{2Ki 18:1}  以色列王以拉的儿子何细亚第三年，犹大王亚哈斯的儿子希西家登基。
{2Ki 18:2}  He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.
{2Ki 18:2}  他登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十九年。他母亲名叫亚比，是撒迦利雅的女儿。
{2Ki 18:3}  And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
{2Ki 18:3}  希西家行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他祖大卫一切所行的。
{2Ki 18:4}  He removed the high places and broke the pillars and cut down the Asherah. And he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it (it was called Nehushtan).
{2Ki 18:4}  他废去邱坛，毁坏柱像，砍下木偶，打碎摩西所造的铜蛇，因为到那时以色列人仍向铜蛇烧香。希西家叫铜蛇为铜块（或作：人称铜蛇为铜像）。
{2Ki 18:5}  He trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel, so that there was none like him among all the kings of Judah after him, nor among those who were before him.
{2Ki 18:5}  希西家倚靠耶和华以色列的神，在他前后的犹大列王中没有一个及他的。
{2Ki 18:6}  For he held fast to the LORD. He did not depart from following him, but kept the commandments that the LORD commanded Moses.
{2Ki 18:6}  因为他专靠耶和华，总不离开，谨守耶和华所吩咐摩西的诫命。
{2Ki 18:7}  And the LORD was with him; wherever he went out, he prospered. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and would not serve him.
{2Ki 18:7}  耶和华与他同在，他无论往何处去尽都亨通。他背叛、不肯事奉亚述王。
{2Ki 18:8}  He struck down the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.
{2Ki 18:8}  希西家攻击非利士人，直到迦萨，并迦萨的四境，从了望楼到坚固城。
{2Ki 18:9}  In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it,
{2Ki 18:9}  希西家王第四年，就是以色列王以拉的儿子何细亚第七年，亚述王撒缦以色上来围困撒玛利亚；
{2Ki 18:10} and at the end of three years he took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
{2Ki 18:10} 过了三年就攻取了城。希西家第六年，以色列王何细亚第九年，撒玛利亚被攻取了。
{2Ki 18:11} The king of Assyria carried the Israelites away to Assyria and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,
{2Ki 18:11} 亚述王将以色列人掳到亚述，把他们安置在哈腊与歌散的哈博河边，并玛代人的城邑；
{2Ki 18:12} because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. They neither listened nor obeyed.
{2Ki 18:12} 都因他们不听从耶和华他们神的话，违背他的约，就是耶和华仆人摩西吩咐他们所当守的。
{2Ki 18:13} In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.
{2Ki 18:13} 希西家王十四年，亚述王西拿基立上来攻击犹大的一切坚固城，将城攻取。
{2Ki 18:14} And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, "I have done wrong; withdraw from me. Whatever you impose on me I will bear." And the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
{2Ki 18:14} 犹大王希西家差人往拉吉去见亚述王，说：“我有罪了，求你离开我；凡你罚我的，我必承当。”于是亚述王罚犹大王希西家银子三百他连得，金子三十他连得。
{2Ki 18:15} And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king's house.
{2Ki 18:15} 希西家就把耶和华殿里和王宫府库里所有的银子都给了他。
{2Ki 18:16} At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD and from the doorposts that Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria.
{2Ki 18:16} 那时，犹大王希西家将耶和华殿门上的金子和他自己包在柱上的金子都刮下来，给了亚述王。
{2Ki 18:17} And the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rab-saris, and the Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the Washer's Field.
{2Ki 18:17} 亚述王从拉吉差遣他珥探、拉伯撒利，和拉伯沙基率领大军往耶路撒冷，到希西家王那里去。他们上到耶路撒冷，就站在上池的水沟旁，在漂布地的大路上。
{2Ki 18:18} And when they called for the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.
{2Ki 18:18} 他们呼叫王的时候，就有希勒家的儿子家宰以利亚敬，并书记舍伯那和亚萨的儿子史官约亚，出来见他们。
{2Ki 18:19} And the Rabshakeh said to them, "Say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours?
{2Ki 18:19} 拉伯沙基说：“你们去告诉希西家说，亚述大王如此说：‘你所倚靠的有什么可仗赖的呢？
{2Ki 18:20} Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? In whom do you now trust, that you have rebelled against me?
{2Ki 18:20} 你说有打仗的计谋和能力，我看不过是虚话。你到底倚靠谁才背叛我呢？
{2Ki 18:21} Behold, you are trusting now in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
{2Ki 18:21} 看哪，你所倚靠的埃及是那压伤的苇杖；人若靠这杖，就必刺透他的手。埃及王法老向一切倚靠他的人也是这样。
{2Ki 18:22} But if you say to me, "We trust in the LORD our God," is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, "You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem"?
{2Ki 18:22} 你们若对我说：我们倚靠耶和华我们的神，希西家岂不是将神的邱坛和祭坛废去，且对犹大和耶路撒冷的人说：你们当在耶路撒冷这坛前敬拜吗？
{2Ki 18:23} Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
{2Ki 18:23} 现在你把当头给我主亚述王，我给你二千匹马，看你这一面骑马的人够不够。
{2Ki 18:24} How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's servants, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
{2Ki 18:24} 若不然，怎能打败我主臣仆中最小的军长呢？你竟倚靠埃及的战车马兵吗？
{2Ki 18:25} Moreover, is it without the LORD that I have come up against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.'"
{2Ki 18:25} 现在我上来攻击毁灭这地，岂没有耶和华的意思吗？耶和华吩咐我说：你上去攻击毁灭这地吧！’”
{2Ki 18:26} Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
{2Ki 18:26} 希勒家的儿子以利亚敬和舍伯那，并约亚，对拉伯沙基说：“求你用亚兰言语和仆人说话，因为我们懂得；不要用犹大言语和我们说话，达到城上百姓的耳中。”
{2Ki 18:27} But the Rabshakeh said to them, "Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and to drink their own urine?"
{2Ki 18:27} 拉伯沙基说：“我主差遣我来，岂是单对你和你的主说这些话吗？不也是对这些坐在城上、要与你们一同吃自己粪、喝自己尿的人说吗？”
{2Ki 18:28} Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!
{2Ki 18:28} 于是拉伯沙基站着，用犹大言语大声喊着说：“你们当听亚述大王的话！
{2Ki 18:29} Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you out of my hand.
{2Ki 18:29} 王如此说：‘你们不要被希西家欺哄了；因他不能救你们脱离我的手。
{2Ki 18:30} Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD by saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
{2Ki 18:30} 也不要听希西家使你们倚靠耶和华，说耶和华必要拯救我们，这城必不交在亚述王的手中。’
{2Ki 18:31} Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: 'Make your peace with me and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern,
{2Ki 18:31} 不要听希西家的话！因亚述王如此说：‘你们要与我和好，出来投降我，各人就可以吃自己葡萄树和无花果树的果子，喝自己井里的水。
{2Ki 18:32} until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey, that you may live, and not die. And do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you by saying, "The LORD will deliver us."
{2Ki 18:32} 等我来领你们到一个地方与你们本地一样，就是有五谷和新酒之地，有粮食和葡萄园之地，有橄榄树和蜂蜜之地，好使你们存活，不至于死。希西家劝导你们，说耶和华必拯救我们；你们不要听他的话。
{2Ki 18:33} Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
{2Ki 18:33} 列国的神有那一个救他本国脱离亚述王的手呢？
{2Ki 18:34} Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
{2Ki 18:34} 哈马、亚珥拔的神在那里呢？西法瓦音、希拿、以瓦的神在那里呢？他们曾救撒玛利亚脱离我的手吗？
{2Ki 18:35} Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"
{2Ki 18:35} 这些国的神有谁曾救自己的国脱离我的手呢？难道耶和华能救耶路撒冷脱离我的手吗？’”
{2Ki 18:36} But the people were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."
{2Ki 18:36} 百姓静默不言，并不回答一句，因为王曾吩咐说：“不要回答他。”
{2Ki 18:37} Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.
{2Ki 18:37} 当下，希勒家的儿子家宰以利亚敬和书记舍伯那，并亚萨的儿子史官约亚，都撕裂衣服，来到希西家那里，将拉伯沙基的话告诉了他。
{2Ki 19:1}  As soon as King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the LORD.
{2Ki 19:1}  希西家王听见，就撕裂衣服，披上麻布，进了耶和华的殿；
{2Ki 19:2}  And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz.
{2Ki 19:2}  使家宰以利亚敬和书记舍伯那，并祭司中的长老，都披上麻布，去见亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚，
{2Ki 19:3}  They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.
{2Ki 19:3}  对他说：“希西家如此说：‘今日是急难、责罚、凌辱的日子，就如妇人将要生产婴孩，却没有力量生产。
{2Ki 19:4}  It may be that the LORD your God heard all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left."
{2Ki 19:4}  或者耶和华你的神听见拉伯沙基的一切话，就是他主人亚述王打发他来辱骂永生神的话，耶和华你的神听见这话，就发斥责。故此，求你为余剩的民扬声祷告。’”
{2Ki 19:5}  When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,
{2Ki 19:5}  希西家王的臣仆就去见以赛亚。
{2Ki 19:6}  Isaiah said to them, "Say to your master, 'Thus says the LORD: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled me.
{2Ki 19:6}  以赛亚对他们说：“要这样对你们的主人说，耶和华如此说：‘你听见亚述王的仆人亵渎我的话，不要惧怕。
{2Ki 19:7}  Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.'"
{2Ki 19:7}  我必惊动（原文作使灵进入）他的心，他要听见风声就归回本地。我必使他在那里倒在刀下。’”
{2Ki 19:8}  The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he heard that the king had left Lachish.
{2Ki 19:8}  拉伯沙基回去，正遇见亚述王攻打立拿，原来他早听见亚述王拔营离开拉吉。
{2Ki 19:9}  Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, "Behold, he has set out to fight against you." So he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
{2Ki 19:9}  亚述王听见人论古实王特哈加说：“他出来要与你争战。”于是亚述王又打发使者去见希西家，吩咐他们说：
{2Ki 19:10} "Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
{2Ki 19:10} “你们对犹大王希西家如此说：‘不要听你所倚靠的神欺哄你，说耶路撒冷必不交在亚述王的手中。
{2Ki 19:11} Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, devoting them to destruction. And shall you be delivered?
{2Ki 19:11} 你总听说亚述诸王向列国所行的，乃是尽行灭绝，难道你还能得救吗？
{2Ki 19:12} Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?
{2Ki 19:12} 我列祖所毁灭的，就是歌散、哈兰、利色，和属提拉撒的伊甸人，这些国的神何曾拯救这些国呢？
{2Ki 19:13} Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?'"
{2Ki 19:13} 哈马的王、亚珥拔的王、西法瓦音城的王、希拿，和以瓦的王都在那里呢？’”
{2Ki 19:14} Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD.
{2Ki 19:14} 希西家从使者手里接过书信来，看完了，就上耶和华的殿，将书信在耶和华面前展开。
{2Ki 19:15} And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said: "O LORD, the God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
{2Ki 19:15} 希西家向耶和华祷告说：“坐在二基路伯上耶和华以色列的神啊，你是天下万国的神，你曾创造天地。
{2Ki 19:16} Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.
{2Ki 19:16} 耶和华啊，求你侧耳而听！耶和华啊，求你睁眼而看！要听西拿基立打发使者来辱骂永生神的话。
{2Ki 19:17} Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands
{2Ki 19:17} 耶和华啊，亚述诸王果然使列国和列国之地变为荒凉，
{2Ki 19:18} and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed.
{2Ki 19:18} 将列国的神像都扔在火里；因为他本不是神，乃是人手所造的，是木头石头的，所以灭绝他。
{2Ki 19:19} So now, O LORD our God, save us, please, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O LORD, are God alone."
{2Ki 19:19} 耶和华我们的神啊，现在求你救我们脱离亚述王的手，使天下万国都知道惟独你耶和华是神！”
{2Ki 19:20} Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Your prayer to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
{2Ki 19:20} 亚摩斯的儿子以赛亚就打发人去见希西家，说：“耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘你既然求我攻击亚述王西拿基立，我已听见了。’
{2Ki 19:21} This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him: "She despises you, she scorns you-- the virgin daughter of Zion; she wags her head behind you-- the daughter of Jerusalem.
{2Ki 19:21} 耶和华论他这样说：锡安的处女藐视你，嗤笑你；耶路撒冷的女子向你摇头。
{2Ki 19:22} "Whom have you mocked and reviled? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes to the heights? Against the Holy One of Israel!
{2Ki 19:22} 你辱骂谁？亵渎谁？扬起声来，高举眼目攻击谁呢？乃是攻击以色列的圣者！
{2Ki 19:23} By your messengers you have mocked the Lord, and you have said, 'With my many chariots I have gone up the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon; I felled its tallest cedars, its choicest cypresses; I entered its farthest lodging place, its most fruitful forest.
{2Ki 19:23} 你藉你的使者辱骂主，并说：我率领许多战车上山顶，到利巴嫩极深之处；我要砍伐其中高大的香柏树和佳美的松树；我必上极高之处，进入肥田的树林。
{2Ki 19:24} I dug wells and drank foreign waters, and I dried up with the sole of my foot all the streams of Egypt.'
{2Ki 19:24} 我已经在外邦挖井喝水；我必用脚掌踏干埃及的一切河。
{2Ki 19:25} "Have you not heard that I determined it long ago? I planned from days of old what now I bring to pass, that you should turn fortified cities into heaps of ruins,
{2Ki 19:25} 耶和华说，我早先所做的，古时所立的，就是现在藉你使坚固城荒废，变为乱堆，这事你岂没有听见吗？
{2Ki 19:26} while their inhabitants, shorn of strength, are dismayed and confounded, and have become like plants of the field and like tender grass, like grass on the housetops, blighted before it is grown.
{2Ki 19:26} 所以其中的居民力量甚小，惊惶羞愧。他们像野草，像青菜，如房顶上的草，又如未长成而枯干的禾稼。
{2Ki 19:27} "But I know your sitting down and your going out and coming in, and your raging against me.
{2Ki 19:27} 你坐下，你出去，你进来，你向我发烈怒，我都知道。
{2Ki 19:28} Because you have raged against me and your complacency has come into my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will turn you back on the way by which you came.
{2Ki 19:28} 因你向我发烈怒，又因你狂傲的话达到我耳中，我就要用钩子钩上你的鼻子，把嚼环放在你口里，使你从你来的路转回去。
{2Ki 19:29} "And this shall be the sign for you: this year eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs of the same. Then in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
{2Ki 19:29} “以色列人哪，我赐你们一个证据：你们今年要吃自生的，明年也要吃自长的；至于后年，你们要耕种收割，栽植葡萄园，吃其中的果子。
{2Ki 19:30} And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
{2Ki 19:30} 犹大家所逃脱余剩的，仍要往下扎根，向上结果。
{2Ki 19:31} For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD will do this.
{2Ki 19:31} 必有余剩的民从耶路撒冷而出；必有逃脱的人从锡安山而来。耶和华的热心必成就这事。
{2Ki 19:32} "Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there, or come before it with a shield or cast up a siege mound against it.
{2Ki 19:32} “所以，耶和华论亚述王如此说：‘他必不得来到这城，也不在这里射箭，不得拿盾牌到城前，也不筑垒攻城。
{2Ki 19:33} By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, declares the LORD.
{2Ki 19:33} 他从哪条路来，必从那条路回去，必不得来到这城。这是耶和华说的。
{2Ki 19:34} For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."
{2Ki 19:34} 因我为自己的缘故，又为我仆人大卫的缘故，必保护拯救这城。’”
{2Ki 19:35} And that night the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. And when people arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
{2Ki 19:35} 当夜，耶和华的使者出去，在亚述营中杀了十八万五千人。清早有人起来，一看，都是死尸了。
{2Ki 19:36} Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went home and lived at Nineveh.
{2Ki 19:36} 亚述王西拿基立就拔营回去，住在尼尼微。
{2Ki 19:37} And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword and escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 19:37} 一日在他的神尼斯洛庙里叩拜，他儿子亚得米勒和沙利色用刀杀了他，就逃到亚拉腊地。他儿子以撒哈顿接续他作王。
{2Ki 20:1}  In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Set your house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover.'"
{2Ki 20:1}  那时，希西家病得要死。亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚去见他，对他说：“耶和华如此说：‘你当留遗命与你的家，因为你必死，不能活了。’”
{2Ki 20:2}  Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, saying,
{2Ki 20:2}  希西家就转脸朝墙，祷告耶和华说：
{2Ki 20:3}  "Now, O LORD, please remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
{2Ki 20:3}  “耶和华啊，求你记念我在你面前怎样存完全的心，按诚实行事，又做你眼中所看为善的。”希西家就痛哭了。
{2Ki 20:4}  And before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him:
{2Ki 20:4}  以赛亚出来，还没有到中院（院：或作城），耶和华的话就临到他，说：
{2Ki 20:5}  "Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the leader of my people, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD,
{2Ki 20:5}  “你回去告诉我民的君希西家说：耶和华你祖大卫的神如此说：‘我听见了你的祷告，看见了你的眼泪，我必医治你；到第三日，你必上到耶和华的殿。
{2Ki 20:6}  and I will add fifteen years to your life. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake."
{2Ki 20:6}  我必加增你十五年的寿数，并且我要救你和这城脱离亚述王的手。我为自己和我仆人大卫的缘故，必保护这城。’”
{2Ki 20:7}  And Isaiah said, "Bring a cake of figs. And let them take and lay it on the boil, that he may recover."
{2Ki 20:7}  以赛亚说：“当取一块无花果饼来。”人就取了来，贴在疮上，王便痊愈了。
{2Ki 20:8}  And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the LORD on the third day?"
{2Ki 20:8}  希西家问以赛亚说：“耶和华必医治我，到第三日，我能上耶和华的殿，有什么兆头呢？”
{2Ki 20:9}  And Isaiah said, "This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has promised: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?"
{2Ki 20:9}  以赛亚说：“耶和华必成就他所说的。这是他给你的兆头：你要日影向前进十度呢？是要往后退十度呢？”
{2Ki 20:10} And Hezekiah answered, "It is an easy thing for the shadow to lengthen ten steps. Rather let the shadow go back ten steps."
{2Ki 20:10} 希西家回答说：“日影向前进十度容易，我要日影往后退十度。”
{2Ki 20:11} And Isaiah the prophet called to the LORD, and he brought the shadow back ten steps, by which it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz.
{2Ki 20:11} 先知以赛亚求告耶和华，耶和华就使亚哈斯的日晷向前进的日影，往后退了十度。
{2Ki 20:12} At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
{2Ki 20:12} 那时，巴比伦王巴拉但的儿子比罗达巴拉但听见希西家病而痊愈，就送书信和礼物给他。
{2Ki 20:13} And Hezekiah welcomed them, and he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
{2Ki 20:13} 希西家听从使者的话，就把他宝库的金子、银子、香料、贵重的膏油，和他武库的一切军器，并他所有的财宝，都给他们看。他家中和他全国之内，希西家没有一样不给他们看的。
{2Ki 20:14} Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, "What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?" And Hezekiah said, "They have come from a far country, from Babylon."
{2Ki 20:14} 于是先知以赛亚来见希西家王，问他说：“这些人说什么？他们从那里来见你？”希西家说：“他们从远方的巴比伦来。”
{2Ki 20:15} He said, "What have they seen in your house?" And Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them."
{2Ki 20:15} 以赛亚说：“他们在你家里看见了什么？”希西家说：“凡我家中所有的，他们都看见了；我财宝中没有一样不给他们看的。”
{2Ki 20:16} Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD:
{2Ki 20:16} 以赛亚对希西家说：“你要听耶和华的话，
{2Ki 20:17} Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the LORD.
{2Ki 20:17} 日子必到，凡你家里所有的，并你列祖积蓄到如今的，都要被掳到巴比伦去，不留下一样。这是耶和华说的。
{2Ki 20:18} And some of your own sons, who will come from you, whom you will father, shall be taken away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
{2Ki 20:18} 并且从你本身所生的众子，其中必有被掳去在巴比伦王宫里当太监的。”
*
你自己的一些儿子们，也就是从你而生，你将做他们父亲的，
*
{2Ki 20:19} Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good." For he thought, "Why not, if there will be peace and security in my days?"
{2Ki 20:19} 希西家对以赛亚说：“你所说耶和华的话甚好！若在我的年日中有太平和稳固的景况，岂不是好吗？”
{2Ki 20:20} The rest of the deeds of Hezekiah and all his might and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 20:20} 希西家其余的事和他的勇力，他怎样挖池、挖沟、引水入城，都写在犹大列王记上。
{2Ki 20:21} And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 20:21} 希西家与他列祖同睡。他儿子玛拿西接续他作王。
{2Ki 21:1}  Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah.
{2Ki 21:1}  玛拿西登基的时候年十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王五十五年。他母亲名叫协西巴。
{2Ki 21:2}  And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
{2Ki 21:2}  玛拿西行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法耶和华在以色列人面前赶出的外邦人所行可憎的事。
{2Ki 21:3}  For he rebuilt the high places that Hezekiah his father had destroyed, and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
{2Ki 21:3}  重新建筑他父希西家所毁坏的邱坛，又为巴力筑坛，做亚舍拉像，效法以色列王亚哈所行的，且敬拜事奉天上的万象；
{2Ki 21:4}  And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem will I put my name."
{2Ki 21:4}  在耶和华殿宇中筑坛。耶和华曾指着这殿说：“我必立我的名在耶路撒冷。”
{2Ki 21:5}  And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
{2Ki 21:5}  他在耶和华殿的两院中为天上的万象筑坛，
{2Ki 21:6}  And he burned his son as an offering and used fortune-telling and omens and dealt with mediums and with necromancers. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
{2Ki 21:6}  并使他的儿子经火，又观兆，用法术，立交鬼的和行巫术的，多行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，惹动他的怒气；
{2Ki 21:7}  And the carved image of Asherah that he had made he set in the house of which the LORD said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.
{2Ki 21:7}  又在殿内立雕刻的亚舍拉像。耶和华曾对大卫和他儿子所罗门说：“我在以色列众支派中所选择的耶路撒冷和这殿，必立我的名，直到永远。
{2Ki 21:8}  And I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander anymore out of the land that I gave to their fathers, if only they will be careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the Law that my servant Moses commanded them."
{2Ki 21:8}  以色列人若谨守遵行我一切所吩咐他们的和我仆人摩西所吩咐他们的一切律法，我就不再使他们挪移离开我所赐给他们列祖之地。”
{2Ki 21:9}  But they did not listen, and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations had done whom the LORD destroyed before the people of Israel.
{2Ki 21:9}  他们却不听从。玛拿西引诱他们行恶，比耶和华在以色列人面前所灭的列国更甚。
{2Ki 21:10} And the LORD said by his servants the prophets,
{2Ki 21:10} 耶和华藉他仆人众先知说：
{2Ki 21:11} "Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations and has done things more evil than all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols,
{2Ki 21:11} “因犹大王玛拿西行这些可憎的恶事比先前亚摩利人所行的更甚，使犹大人拜他的偶像，陷在罪里；
{2Ki 21:12} therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Jerusalem and Judah such disaster that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
{2Ki 21:12} 所以耶和华以色列的神如此说：我必降祸与耶路撒冷和犹大，叫一切听见的人无不耳鸣。
{2Ki 21:13} And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria, and the plumb line of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
{2Ki 21:13} 我必用量撒玛利亚的准绳和亚哈家的线铊拉在耶路撒冷上，必擦净耶路撒冷，如人擦盘，将盘倒扣。
{2Ki 21:14} And I will forsake the remnant of my heritage and give them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies,
{2Ki 21:14} 我必弃掉所余剩的子民（原文作产业），把他们交在仇敌手中，使他们成为一切仇敌掳掠之物；
{2Ki 21:15} because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day."
{2Ki 21:15} 是因他们自从列祖出埃及直到如今，常行我眼中看为恶的事，惹动我的怒气。”
{2Ki 21:16} Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides the sin that he made Judah to sin so that they did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
{2Ki 21:16} 玛拿西行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，使犹大人陷在罪里，又流许多无辜人的血，充满了耶路撒冷，从这边直到那边。
{2Ki 21:17} Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 21:17} 玛拿西其余的事，凡他所行的和他所犯的罪都写在犹大列王记上。
{2Ki 21:18} And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza, and Amon his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 21:18} 玛拿西与他列祖同睡，葬在自己宫院乌撒的园内；他儿子亚们接续他作王。
{2Ki 21:19} Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
{2Ki 21:19} 亚们登基的时候年二十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王二年。他母亲名叫米舒利密，是约提巴人哈鲁斯的女儿。
{2Ki 21:20} And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done.
{2Ki 21:20} 亚们行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，与他父亲玛拿西所行的一样；
{2Ki 21:21} He walked in all the way in which his father walked and served the idols that his father served and worshiped them.
{2Ki 21:21} 行他父亲一切所行的，敬奉他父亲所敬奉的偶像，
{2Ki 21:22} He abandoned the LORD, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD.
{2Ki 21:22} 离弃耶和华他列祖的神，不遵行耶和华的道。
{2Ki 21:23} And the servants of Amon conspired against him and put the king to death in his house.
{2Ki 21:23} 亚们王的臣仆背叛他，在宫里杀了他。
{2Ki 21:24} But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
{2Ki 21:24} 但国民杀了那些背叛亚们王的人，立他儿子约西亚接续他作王。
{2Ki 21:25} Now the rest of the acts of Amon that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 21:25} 亚们其余所行的事都写在犹大列王记上。
{2Ki 21:26} And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 21:26} 亚们葬在乌撒的园内自己的坟墓里。他儿子约西亚接续他作王。
{2Ki 22:1}  Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
{2Ki 22:1}  约西亚登基的时候年八岁，在耶路撒冷作王三十一年。他母亲名叫耶底大，是波斯加人亚大雅的女儿。
{2Ki 22:2}  And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in all the way of David his father, and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.
{2Ki 22:2}  约西亚行耶和华眼中看为正的事，行他祖大卫一切所行的，不偏左右。
{2Ki 22:3}  In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the secretary, to the house of the LORD, saying,
{2Ki 22:3}  约西亚王十八年，王差遣米书兰的孙子、亚萨利的儿子书记沙番上耶和华殿去，吩咐他说：
{2Ki 22:4}  "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money that has been brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people.
{2Ki 22:4}  “你去见大祭司希勒家，使他将奉到耶和华殿的银子，就是守门的从民中收聚的银子，数算数算，
{2Ki 22:5}  And let it be given into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD, and let them give it to the workmen who are at the house of the LORD, repairing the house
{2Ki 22:5}  交给耶和华殿里办事的人，使他们转交耶和华殿里做工的人，好修理殿的破坏之处，
{2Ki 22:6}  (that is, to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons), and let them use it for buying timber and quarried stone to repair the house.
{2Ki 22:6}  就是转交木匠和工人，并瓦匠，又买木料和凿成的石头修理殿宇，
{2Ki 22:7}  But no accounting shall be asked from them for the money that is delivered into their hand, for they deal honestly."
{2Ki 22:7}  将银子交在办事的人手里，不与他们算账，因为他们办事诚实。”
{2Ki 22:8}  And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD." And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
{2Ki 22:8}  大祭司希勒家对书记沙番说：“我在耶和华殿里得了律法书。”希勒家将书递给沙番，沙番就看了。
{2Ki 22:9}  And Shaphan the secretary came to the king, and reported to the king, "Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD."
{2Ki 22:9}  书记沙番到王那里，回覆王说：“你的仆人已将殿里的银子倒出数算，交给耶和华殿里办事的人了。”
{2Ki 22:10} Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it before the king.
{2Ki 22:10} 书记沙番又对王说：“祭司希勒家递给我一卷书。”沙番就在王面前读那书。
{2Ki 22:11} When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes.
{2Ki 22:11} 王听见律法书上的话，便撕裂衣服，
{2Ki 22:12} And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,
{2Ki 22:12} 吩咐祭司希勒家与沙番的儿子亚希甘、米该亚的儿子亚革波、书记沙番和王的臣仆亚撒雅，说：
{2Ki 22:13} "Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us."
{2Ki 22:13} “你们去为我、为民、为犹大众人，以这书上的话求问耶和华；因为我们列祖没有听从这书上的言语，没有遵着书上所吩咐我们的去行，耶和华就向我们大发烈怒。”
{2Ki 22:14} So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter), and they talked with her.
{2Ki 22:14} 于是，祭司希勒家和亚希甘、亚革波、沙番、亚撒雅都去见女先知户勒大。户勒大是掌管礼服沙龙的妻；沙龙是哈珥哈斯的孙子、特瓦的儿子。户勒大住在耶路撒冷第二区。他们请问于他。
{2Ki 22:15} And she said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: 'Tell the man who sent you to me,
{2Ki 22:15} 他对他们说：“耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘你们可以回覆那差遣你们来见我的人说，
{2Ki 22:16} Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read.
{2Ki 22:16} 耶和华如此说：我必照着犹大王所读那书上的一切话，降祸与这地和其上的居民。
{2Ki 22:17} Because they have forsaken me and have made offerings to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.
{2Ki 22:17} 因为他们离弃我，向别神烧香，用他们手所做的惹我发怒，所以我的忿怒必向这地发作，总不止息。’
{2Ki 22:18} But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding the words that you have heard,
{2Ki 22:18} 然而，差遣你们来求问耶和华的犹大王，你们要这样回覆他说：‘耶和华以色列的神如此说：至于你所听见的话，
{2Ki 22:19} because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard how I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the LORD.
{2Ki 22:19} 就是听见我指着这地和其上的居民所说、要使这地变为荒场、民受咒诅的话，你便心里敬服，在我面前自卑，撕裂衣服，向我哭泣，因此我应允了你。这是我耶和华说的。
{2Ki 22:20} Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place.'" And they brought back word to the king.
{2Ki 22:20} 我必使你平平安安的归到坟墓到你列祖那里；我要降与这地的一切灾祸，你也不至亲眼看见。’”他们就回覆王去了。
{2Ki 23:1}  Then the king sent, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him.
{2Ki 23:1}  王差遣人招聚犹大和耶路撒冷的众长老来。
{2Ki 23:2}  And the king went up to the house of the LORD, and with him all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the prophets, all the people, both small and great. And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD.
{2Ki 23:2}  王和犹大众人与耶路撒冷的居民，并祭司、先知，和所有的百姓，无论大小，都一同上到耶和华的殿；王就把耶和华殿里所得的约书念给他们听。
{2Ki 23:3}  And the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people joined in the covenant.
{2Ki 23:3}  王站在柱旁，在耶和华面前立约，要尽心尽性地顺从耶和华，遵守他的诫命、法度、律例，成就这书上所记的约言。众民都服从这约。
{2Ki 23:4}  And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the threshold to bring out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel.
{2Ki 23:4}  王吩咐大祭司希勒家和副祭司，并把门的，将那为巴力和亚舍拉，并天上万象所造的器皿，都从耶和华殿里搬出来，在耶路撒冷外汲沦溪旁的田间烧了，把灰拿到伯特利去。
{2Ki 23:5}  And he deposed the priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to make offerings in the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and the moon and the constellations and all the host of the heavens.
{2Ki 23:5}  从前犹大列王所立拜偶像的祭司，在犹大城邑的邱坛和耶路撒冷的周围烧香，现在王都废去，又废去向巴力和日、月、行星（或作：十二宫），并天上万象烧香的人；
{2Ki 23:6}  And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the LORD, outside Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron and beat it to dust and cast the dust of it upon the graves of the common people.
{2Ki 23:6}  又从耶和华殿里将亚舍拉搬到耶路撒冷外汲沦溪边焚烧，打碎成灰，将灰撒在平民的坟上；
{2Ki 23:7}  And he broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes who were in the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.
{2Ki 23:7}  又拆毁耶和华殿里娈童的屋子，就是妇女为亚舍拉织帐子的屋子，
{2Ki 23:8}  And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had made offerings, from Geba to Beersheba. And he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on one's left at the gate of the city.
{2Ki 23:8}  并且从犹大的城邑带众祭司来，污秽祭司烧香的邱坛，从迦巴直到别是巴，又拆毁城门旁的邱坛，这邱坛在邑宰约书亚门前，进城门的左边。
{2Ki 23:9}  However, the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.
{2Ki 23:9}  但是邱坛的祭司不登耶路撒冷耶和华的坛，只在他们弟兄中间吃无酵饼。
{2Ki 23:10} And he defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, that no one might burn his son or his daughter as an offering to Molech.
{2Ki 23:10} 又污秽欣嫩子谷的陀斐特，不许人在那里使儿女经火献给摩洛；
{2Ki 23:11} And he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts. And he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
{2Ki 23:11} 又将犹大列王在耶和华殿门旁、太监拿单米勒靠近游廊的屋子、向日头所献的马废去，且用火焚烧日车。
{2Ki 23:12} And the altars on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, he pulled down and broke in pieces and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
{2Ki 23:12} 犹大列王在亚哈斯楼顶上所筑的坛和玛拿西在耶和华殿两院中所筑的坛，王都拆毁打碎了，就把灰倒在汲沦溪中。
{2Ki 23:13} And the king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, to the south of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
{2Ki 23:13} 从前以色列王所罗门在耶路撒冷前、邪僻山右边为西顿人可憎的神亚斯他录、摩押人可憎的神基抹、亚扪人可憎的神米勒公所筑的邱坛，王都污秽了，
{2Ki 23:14} And he broke in pieces the pillars and cut down the Asherim and filled their places with the bones of men.
{2Ki 23:14} 又打碎柱像，砍下木偶，将人的骨头充满了那地方。
{2Ki 23:15} Moreover, the altar at Bethel, the high place erected by Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, that altar with the high place he pulled down and burned, reducing it to dust. He also burned the Asherah.
{2Ki 23:15} 他将伯特利的坛，就是叫以色列人陷在罪里、尼八的儿子耶罗波安所筑的那坛，都拆毁焚烧，打碎成灰，并焚烧了亚舍拉。
{2Ki 23:16} And as Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the mount. And he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar and defiled it, according to the word of the LORD that the man of God proclaimed, who had predicted these things.
{2Ki 23:16} 约西亚回头，看见山上的坟墓，就打发人将坟墓里的骸骨取出来，烧在坛上，污秽了坛，正如从前神人宣传耶和华的话。
{2Ki 23:17} Then he said, "What is that monument that I see?" And the men of the city told him, "It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted these things that you have done against the altar at Bethel."
{2Ki 23:17} 约西亚问说：“我所看见的是什么碑？”那城里的人回答说：“先前有神人从犹大来，预先说王现在向伯特利坛所行的事，这就是他的墓碑。”
{2Ki 23:18} And he said, "Let him be; let no man move his bones." So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.
{2Ki 23:18} 约西亚说：“由他吧！不要挪移他的骸骨。”他们就不动他的骸骨，也不动从撒玛利亚来那先知的骸骨。
{2Ki 23:19} And Josiah removed all the shrines also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which kings of Israel had made, provoking the LORD to anger. He did to them according to all that he had done at Bethel.
{2Ki 23:19} 从前以色列诸王在撒玛利亚的城邑建筑邱坛的殿，惹动耶和华的怒气，现在约西亚都废去了，就如他在伯特利所行的一般；
{2Ki 23:20} And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
{2Ki 23:20} 又将邱坛的祭司都杀在坛上，并在坛上烧人的骨头，就回耶路撒冷去了。
{2Ki 23:21} And the king commanded all the people, "Keep the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant."
{2Ki 23:21} 王吩咐众民说：“你们当照这约书上所写的，向耶和华你们的神守逾越节。”
{2Ki 23:22} For no such Passover had been kept since the days of the judges who judged Israel, or during all the days of the kings of Israel or of the kings of Judah.
{2Ki 23:22} 自从士师治理以色列人和以色列王、犹大王的时候，直到如今，实在没有守过这样的逾越节；
{2Ki 23:23} But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was kept to the LORD in Jerusalem.
{2Ki 23:23} 只有约西亚王十八年在耶路撒冷向耶和华守这逾越节。
{2Ki 23:24} Moreover, Josiah put away the mediums and the necromancers and the household gods and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might establish the words of the law that were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
{2Ki 23:24} 凡犹大国和耶路撒冷所有交鬼的、行巫术的，与家中的神像和偶像，并一切可憎之物，约西亚尽都除掉，成就了祭司希勒家在耶和华殿里所得律法书上所写的话。
{2Ki 23:25} Before him there was no king like him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses, nor did any like him arise after him.
{2Ki 23:25} 在约西亚以前没有王像他尽心、尽性、尽力地归向耶和华，遵行摩西的一切律法；在他以后也没有兴起一个王像他。
{2Ki 23:26} Still the LORD did not turn from the burning of his great wrath, by which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him.
{2Ki 23:26} 然而，耶和华向犹大所发猛烈的怒气仍不止息，是因玛拿西诸事惹动他。
{2Ki 23:27} And the LORD said, "I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city that I have chosen, Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there."
{2Ki 23:27} 耶和华说：“我必将犹大人从我面前赶出，如同赶出以色列人一般；我必弃掉我从前所选择的这城耶路撒冷和我所说立我名的殿。”
{2Ki 23:28} Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 23:28} 约西亚其余的事，凡他所行的都写在犹大列王记上。
{2Ki 23:29} In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates. King Josiah went to meet him, and Pharaoh Neco killed him at Megiddo, as soon as he saw him.
{2Ki 23:29} 约西亚年间，埃及王法老尼哥上到伯拉大河攻击亚述王；约西亚王去抵挡他。埃及王遇见约西亚在米吉多，就杀了他。
{2Ki 23:30} And his servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's place.
{2Ki 23:30} 他的臣仆用车将他的尸首从米吉多送到耶路撒冷，葬在他自己的坟墓里。国民膏约西亚的儿子约哈斯接续他父亲作王。
{2Ki 23:31} Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
{2Ki 23:31} 约哈斯登基的时候年二十三岁，在耶路撒冷作王三个月。他母亲名叫哈慕他，是立拿人耶利米的女儿。
{2Ki 23:32} And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
{2Ki 23:32} 约哈斯行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法他列祖一切所行的。
{2Ki 23:33} And Pharaoh Neco put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and laid on the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
{2Ki 23:33} 法老尼哥将约哈斯锁禁在哈马地的利比拉，不许他在耶路撒冷作王，又罚犹大国银子一百他连得，金子一他连得。
{2Ki 23:34} And Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away, and he came to Egypt and died there.
{2Ki 23:34} 法老尼哥立约西亚的儿子以利亚敬接续他父亲约西亚作王，给他改名叫约雅敬，却将约哈斯带到埃及，他就死在那里。
{2Ki 23:35} And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land to give the money according to the command of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, from everyone according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Neco.
{2Ki 23:35} 约雅敬将金银给法老，遵着法老的命向国民徵取金银，按着各人的力量派定，索要金银，好给法老尼哥。
{2Ki 23:36} Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
{2Ki 23:36} 约雅敬登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王十一年。他母亲名叫西布大，是鲁玛人毗大雅的女儿。
{2Ki 23:37} And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
{2Ki 23:37} 约雅敬行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法他列祖一切所行的。
{2Ki 24:1}  In his days, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. Then he turned and rebelled against him.
{2Ki 24:1}  约雅敬年间，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒上到犹大；约雅敬服事他三年，然后背叛他。
{2Ki 24:2}  And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldeans and bands of the Syrians and bands of the Moabites and bands of the Ammonites, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by his servants the prophets.
{2Ki 24:2}  耶和华使迦勒底军、亚兰军、摩押军，和亚扪人的军来攻击约雅敬，毁灭犹大，正如耶和华藉他仆人众先知所说的。
{2Ki 24:3}  Surely this came upon Judah at the command of the LORD, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done,
{2Ki 24:3}  这祸临到犹大人，诚然是耶和华所命的，要将他们从自己面前赶出，是因玛拿西所犯的一切罪；
{2Ki 24:4}  and also for the innocent blood that he had shed. For he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the LORD would not pardon.
{2Ki 24:4}  又因他流无辜人的血，充满了耶路撒冷；耶和华决不肯赦免。
{2Ki 24:5}  Now the rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
{2Ki 24:5}  约雅敬其余的事，凡他所行的都写在犹大列王记上。
{2Ki 24:6}  So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
{2Ki 24:6}  约雅敬与他列祖同睡。他儿子约雅斤接续他作王。
{2Ki 24:7}  And the king of Egypt did not come again out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates.
{2Ki 24:7}  埃及王不再从他国中出来；因为巴比伦王将埃及王所管之地，从埃及小河直到伯拉大河都夺去了。
{2Ki 24:8}  Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
{2Ki 24:8}  约雅斤登基的时候年十八岁，在耶路撒冷作王三个月。他母亲名叫尼护施他，是耶路撒冷人以利拿单的女儿。
{2Ki 24:9}  And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.
{2Ki 24:9}  约雅斤行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法他父亲一切所行的。
{2Ki 24:10} At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
{2Ki 24:10} 那时，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒的军兵上到耶路撒冷，围困城。
{2Ki 24:11} And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it,
{2Ki 24:11} 当他军兵围困城的时候，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒就亲自来了。
{2Ki 24:12} and Jehoiachin the king of Judah gave himself up to the king of Babylon, himself and his mother and his servants and his officials and his palace officials. The king of Babylon took him prisoner in the eighth year of his reign
{2Ki 24:12} 犹大王约雅斤和他母亲、臣仆、首领、太监一同出城，投降巴比伦王；巴比伦王便拿住他。那时是巴比伦王第八年。
{2Ki 24:13} and carried off all the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold in the temple of the LORD, which Solomon king of Israel had made, as the LORD had foretold.
{2Ki 24:13} 巴比伦王将耶和华殿和王宫里的宝物都拿去了，将以色列王所罗门所造耶和华殿里的金器都毁坏了，正如耶和华所说的；
{2Ki 24:14} He carried away all Jerusalem and all the officials and all the mighty men of valor, 10,000 captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths. None remained, except the poorest people of the land.
{2Ki 24:14} 又将耶路撒冷的众民和众首领，并所有大能的勇士，共一万人，连一切木匠、铁匠都掳了去；除了国中极贫穷的人以外，没有剩下的；
{2Ki 24:15} And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon. The king's mother, the king's wives, his officials, and the chief men of the land he took into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
{2Ki 24:15} 并将约雅斤和王母、后妃、太监，与国中的大官，都从耶路撒冷掳到巴比伦去了；
{2Ki 24:16} And the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon all the men of valor, 7,000, and the craftsmen and the metal workers, 1,000, all of them strong and fit for war.
{2Ki 24:16} 又将一切勇士七千人和木匠、铁匠一千人，都是能上阵的勇士，全掳到巴比伦去了。
{2Ki 24:17} And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
{2Ki 24:17} 巴比伦王立约雅斤的叔叔玛探雅代替他作王，给玛探雅改名叫西底家。
{2Ki 24:18} Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
{2Ki 24:18} 西底家登基的时候年二十一岁，在耶路撒冷作王十一年。他母亲名叫哈慕他，是立拿人耶利米的女儿。
{2Ki 24:19} And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
{2Ki 24:19} 西底家行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，是照约雅敬一切所行的。
{2Ki 24:20} For because of the anger of the LORD it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
{2Ki 24:20} 因此耶和华的怒气在耶路撒冷和犹大发作，以致将人民从自己面前赶出。
{2Ki 25:1}  And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem and laid siege to it. And they built siegeworks all around it.
{2Ki 25:1}  西底家背叛巴比伦王。他作王第九年十月初十日，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒率领全军来攻击耶路撒冷，对城安营，四围筑垒攻城。
{2Ki 25:2}  So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
{2Ki 25:2}  于是城被围困，直到西底家王十一年。
{2Ki 25:3}  On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
{2Ki 25:3}  四月初九日，城里有大饥荒，甚至百姓都没有粮食。
{2Ki 25:4}  Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, and the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah.
{2Ki 25:4}  城被攻破，一切兵丁就在夜间从靠近王园两城中间的门逃跑。迦勒底人正在四围攻城，王就向亚拉巴逃走。
{2Ki 25:5}  But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
{2Ki 25:5}  迦勒底的军队追赶王，在耶利哥的平原追上他；他的全军都离开他四散了。
{2Ki 25:6}  Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they passed sentence on him.
{2Ki 25:6}  迦勒底人就拿住王，带他到在利比拉的巴比伦王那里审判他。
{2Ki 25:7}  They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains and took him to Babylon.
{2Ki 25:7}  在西底家眼前杀了他的众子，并且剜了西底家的眼睛，用铜链锁着他，带到巴比伦去。
{2Ki 25:8}  In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month--that was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon--Nebuzaradan, the captain of the bodyguard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
{2Ki 25:8}  巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒十九年五月初七日，巴比伦王的臣仆、护卫长尼布撒拉旦来到耶路撒冷，
{2Ki 25:9}  And he burned the house of the LORD and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
{2Ki 25:9}  用火焚烧耶和华的殿和王宫，又焚烧耶路撒冷的房屋，就是各大户家的房屋。
{2Ki 25:10} And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
{2Ki 25:10} 跟从护卫长迦勒底的全军就拆毁耶路撒冷四围的城墙。
{2Ki 25:11} And the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile.
{2Ki 25:11} 那时护卫长尼布撒拉旦将城里所剩下的百姓，并已经投降巴比伦王的人，以及大众所剩下的人，都掳去了。
{2Ki 25:12} But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
{2Ki 25:12} 但护卫长留下些民中最穷的，使他们修理葡萄园，耕种田地。
{2Ki 25:13} And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon.
{2Ki 25:13} 耶和华殿的铜柱，并耶和华殿的盆座和铜海，迦勒底人都打碎了，将那铜运到巴比伦去了，
{2Ki 25:14} And they took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service,
{2Ki 25:14} 又带去锅、铲子、蜡剪、调羹，并所用的一切铜器，
{2Ki 25:15} the fire pans also and the bowls. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver.
{2Ki 25:15} 火鼎、碗，无论金的银的，护卫长也都带去了。
{2Ki 25:16} As for the two pillars, the one sea, and the stands that Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.
{2Ki 25:16} 所罗门为耶和华殿所造的两根铜柱、一个铜海，和几个盆座，这一切的铜，多得无法可称。
{2Ki 25:17} The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and on it was a capital of bronze. The height of the capital was three cubits. A latticework and pomegranates, all of bronze, were all around the capital. And the second pillar had the same, with the latticework.
{2Ki 25:17} 这一根柱子高十八肘，柱上有铜顶，高三肘；铜顶的周围有网子和石榴，都是铜的。那一根柱子，照此一样，也有网子。
{2Ki 25:18} And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the threshold;
{2Ki 25:18} 护卫长拿住大祭司西莱雅、副祭司西番亚，和三个把门的，
{2Ki 25:19} and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and five men of the king's council who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the city.
{2Ki 25:19} 又从城中拿住一个管理兵丁的官（或作：太监），并在城里所遇常见王面的五个人和检点国民军长的书记，以及城里遇见的国民六十个人。
{2Ki 25:20} And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
{2Ki 25:20} 护卫长尼布撒拉旦将这些人带到在利比拉的巴比伦王那里。
{2Ki 25:21} And the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land.
{2Ki 25:21} 巴比伦王就把他们击杀在哈马地的利比拉。这样，犹大人被掳去离开本地。
{2Ki 25:22} And over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, governor.
{2Ki 25:22} 至于犹大国剩下的民，就是巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒所剩下的，巴比伦王立了沙番的孙子、亚希甘的儿子基大利作他们的省长。
{2Ki 25:23} Now when all the captains and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah governor, they came with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah, namely, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite.
{2Ki 25:23} 众军长和属他们的人听见巴比伦王立了基大利作省长，于是军长尼探雅的儿子以实玛利、加利亚的儿子约哈难、尼陀法人单户蔑的儿子西莱雅、玛迦人的儿子雅撒尼亚，和属他们的人都到米斯巴见基大利。
{2Ki 25:24} And Gedaliah swore to them and their men, saying, "Do not be afraid because of the Chaldean officials. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
{2Ki 25:24} 基大利向他们和属他们的人起誓说：“你们不必惧怕迦勒底臣仆，只管住在这地服事巴比伦王，就可以得福。”
{2Ki 25:25} But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck down Gedaliah and put him to death along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
{2Ki 25:25} 七月间，宗室以利沙玛的孙子、尼探雅的儿子以实玛利带着十个人来，杀了基大利和同他在米斯巴的犹大人与迦勒底人。
{2Ki 25:26} Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
{2Ki 25:26} 于是众民，无论大小，连众军长；因为惧怕迦勒底人，都起身往埃及去了。
{2Ki 25:27} And in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, graciously freed Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison.
{2Ki 25:27} 犹大王约雅斤被掳后三十七年，巴比伦王以未米罗达元年十二月二十七日，使犹大王约雅斤抬头，提他出监；
{2Ki 25:28} And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
{2Ki 25:28} 又对他说恩言，使他的位高过与他一同在巴比伦众王的位，
{2Ki 25:29} So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table,
{2Ki 25:29} 给他脱了囚服。他终身常在巴比伦王面前吃饭。
{2Ki 25:30} and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, according to his daily needs, as long as he lived.
{2Ki 25:30} 王赐他所需用的食物，日日赐他一分，终身都是这样。
