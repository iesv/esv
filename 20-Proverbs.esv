{Pro 1:31}  所以必吃自结的果子，充满自设的计谋。
{Pro 1:32}  For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them;

{Pro 2:14}  who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,
{Pro 2:14}  欢喜作恶，喜爱恶人的乖僻，
{Pro 2:15}  men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.
{Pro 2:15}  在他们的道中弯曲，在他们的路上偏僻。
{Pro 2:16}  So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,
{Pro 2:16}  智慧要救你脱离淫妇，就是那油嘴滑舌的外女。
{Pro 2:17}  who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;
{Pro 2:17}  他离弃幼年的配偶，忘了神的盟约。
{Pro 2:18}  for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;
{Pro 2:18}  他的家陷入死地；他的路偏向阴间。
{Pro 2:19}  none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.
{Pro 2:19}  凡到他那里去的，不得转回，也得不着生命的路。
{Pro 2:20}  So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.
{Pro 2:20}  智慧必使你行善人的道，守义人的路。
{Pro 2:21}  For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,

{Pro 2:22}  but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.
{Pro 2:22}  惟有恶人必然剪除；奸诈的，必然拔出。
{Pro 3:1}   My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,

{Pro 3:11}  我儿，你不可轻看耶和华的管教（或作：惩治），也不可厌烦他的责备；
{Pro 3:12}  for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.
{Pro 3:12}  因为耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。
{Pro 3:13}  Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding,
{Pro 3:13}  得智慧，得聪明的，这人便为有福。
{Pro 3:14}  for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold.
{Pro 3:14}  因为得智慧胜过得银子，其利益强如精金，
{Pro 3:15}  She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.
{Pro 3:15}  比珍珠（或作：红宝石）宝贵；你一切所喜爱的，都不足与比较。
{Pro 3:16}  Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.

{Pro 3:19}  The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;
{Pro 3:19}  耶和华以智慧立地，以聪明定天，
{Pro 3:20}  by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew.
{Pro 3:20}  以知识使深渊裂开，使天空滴下甘露。
{Pro 3:21}  My son, do not lose sight of these-- keep sound wisdom and discretion,

{Pro 3:28}  你那里若有现成的，不可对邻舍说：去吧，明天再来，我必给你。
{Pro 3:29}  Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.
{Pro 3:29}  你的邻舍既在你附近安居，你不可设计害他。

{Pro 3:31}  Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,

{Pro 3:32}  for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence.
{Pro 3:32}  因为，乖僻人为耶和华所憎恶；正直人为他所亲密。
{Pro 3:33}  The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.

{Pro 4:2}   for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching.
{Pro 4:2}   因我所给你们的是好教训；不可离弃我的法则（或作：指教）。
{Pro 4:3}   When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,
{Pro 4:3}   我在父亲面前为孝子，在母亲眼中为独一的娇儿。
{Pro 4:4}   he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live.
{Pro 4:4}   父亲教训我说：你心要存记我的言语，遵守我的命令，便得存活。

{Pro 4:13}  Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.
{Pro 4:13}  要持定训诲，不可放松；必当谨守，因为他是你的生命。
{Pro 4:14}  Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil.
{Pro 4:14}  不可行恶人的路；不要走坏人的道。
{Pro 4:15}  Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.
{Pro 4:15}  要躲避，不可经过；要转身而去。
{Pro 4:16}  For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.
{Pro 4:16}  这等人若不行恶，不得睡觉；不使人跌倒，睡卧不安；
{Pro 4:17}  For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
{Pro 4:17}  因为他们以奸恶吃饼，以强暴喝酒。
{Pro 4:18}  But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.
{Pro 4:18}  但义人的路好像黎明的光，越照越明，直到日午。
{Pro 4:19}  The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.
{Pro 4:19}  恶人的道好像幽暗，自己不知因什么跌倒。
{Pro 4:20}  My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.
{Pro 4:20}  我儿，要留心听我的言词，侧耳听我的话语，
{Pro 4:21}  Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.
{Pro 4:21}  都不可离你的眼目，要存记在你心中。
{Pro 4:22}  For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh.
{Pro 4:22}  因为得着他的，就得了生命，又得了医全体的良药。
{Pro 4:23}  Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.
{Pro 4:23}  你要保守你心，胜过保守一切（或作：你要切切保守你心），因为一生的果效是由心发出。

{Pro 5:2}   that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.
{Pro 5:2}   为要使你谨守谋略，嘴唇保存知识。
{Pro 5:3}   For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,
{Pro 5:3}   因为淫妇的嘴滴下蜂蜜；他的口比油更滑，
{Pro 5:4}   but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
{Pro 5:4}   至终却苦似茵陈，快如两刃的刀。
{Pro 5:5}   Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol;
{Pro 5:5}   他的脚下入死地；他脚步踏住阴间，
{Pro 5:6}   she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.
{Pro 5:6}   以致他找不着生命平坦的道。他的路变迁不定，自己还不知道。
{Pro 5:7}   And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
{Pro 5:7}   众子啊，现在要听从我；不可离弃我口中的话。
{Pro 5:8}   Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,
{Pro 5:8}   你所行的道要离他远，不可就近他的房门，
{Pro 5:9}   lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless,
{Pro 5:9}   恐怕将你的尊荣给别人，将你的岁月给残忍的人；
{Pro 5:10}  lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner,
{Pro 5:10}  恐怕外人满得你的力量，你劳碌得来的，归入外人的家；
{Pro 5:11}  and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed,
{Pro 5:11}  终久，你皮肉和身体消毁，你就悲叹，
{Pro 5:12}  and you say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!
{Pro 5:12}  说：我怎么恨恶训诲，心中藐视责备，
{Pro 5:13}  I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.
{Pro 5:13}  也不听从我师傅的话，又不侧耳听那教训我的人？
{Pro 5:14}  I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation."
{Pro 5:14}  我在圣会里，几乎落在诸般恶中。
{Pro 5:15}  Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.
{Pro 5:15}  你要喝自己池中的水，饮自己井里的活水。
{Pro 5:16}  Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?
{Pro 5:16}  你的泉源岂可涨溢在外？你的河水岂可流在街上？
{Pro 5:17}  Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.

{Pro 5:19}  a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.
{Pro 5:19}  他如可爱的麀鹿，可喜的母鹿；愿他的胸怀使你时时知足，他的爱情使你常常恋慕。
{Pro 5:20}  Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?
{Pro 5:20}  我儿，你为何恋慕淫妇？为何抱外女的胸怀？
{Pro 5:21}  For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths.
{Pro 5:21}  因为，人所行的道都在耶和华眼前；他也修平人一切的路。
{Pro 5:22}  The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.
{Pro 5:22}  恶人必被自己的罪孽捉住；他必被自己的罪恶如绳索缠绕。

{Pro 8:27}  他立高天，我在那里；他在渊面的周围，划出圆圈。
{Pro 8:28}  when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,
{Pro 8:28}  上使穹苍坚硬，下使渊源稳固，
{Pro 8:29}  when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
{Pro 8:29}  为沧海定出界限，使水不越过他的命令，立定大地的根基。
{Pro 8:30}  then I was beside him, like a master workman, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always,
